hello and welcome to the book quiz the final contest in this series we started with eight teams of famous faces and now we're left with the best two who have gamely battled their way through some pretty tough questions to get here in just under half an hour i'll be declaring one team the series champions our first finalists defeated miranda sawyer and anthony horowitz in their opening match and then margaret jay and david nicholls in their semi final amassing a total of one hundred ten points in the two matches despite lots of squabbling wendy and giles got their act together in the final round so please welcome back wendy holden and giles coren their opponents got here by knocking out simon hoggart and al kennedy in their first match and india knight and james delingpole in the semi final with a combined score of one hundred nineteen points last time david was marvellous on marlow whilst daisy managed to identify for whom the bell tolls in the picture round without having the faintest idea how she did it or indeed why she did it please welcome the other finalists david aaronovitch and daisy goodman both teams should know the drill by now but i'll just remind them that for their opening round they'll get two works of literature to identify and then i'll ask them to make a connection between the two two points for a correct answer if you get it wrong i hand it to the opposing team for a single point first quotation goes to wendy and giles it's from a work first published in nineteen eighty four i want you to tell me which novelist wrote this
it's a sort of campus type novel isn't it it is well it's talking about a conference so it could be a literary conference academic
sounds more like a travel type of thing sounds more like
do you think i think so yeah
we think it's david lodge
it is david lodge and it's from small world wendy and giles keep heart now it's a piece of poetry first published in nineteen thirty eight
oh god i know this it's louis macneice yeah it's bagpipe music
it is louis macneice from bagpipe music very well done on that now the connection between quotation one and two which education institution connects david lodge and louis macneice
birmingham university university of birmingham
it's laurence binyon it is indeed laurence binyon
it's for the fallen particularly associated with remembrance sundays of course now here's your second quotation daisy and david and it's a translation from the chinese this time i want to know its title
give me your best shot
the i ching no
i'm afraid it's not the i ching do you have any idea wendy and giles
one of the harry potter books in chinese
it sounds like a story it sounds like
i'm gonna have to put you out of your misery
please do journey to the west or monkey
in the translation by arthur waley
it was on the tip of my tongue
you're not finished yet david and daisy please no i'm afraid you're not you've got to deliver me the connection can you tell me which institution connects laurence binyon and arthur waley
wasn't it the british diplomatic service or was it oxford university she thinks they were both diplomats
that is the wrong answer i'm going to give it over to you have a wee think about it queens park rangers football club no the answer is the british museum after he graduated he worked at the british museum where he spent most of his working life employing his protege arthur waley there from nineteen thirteen now the score at the end of round one daisy and david have a paltry one wendy and giles are making steady progress with five thanks for the last time to the actor robert powell for lending his voice to our extracts throughout this series now i'm going to ask our teams to identify some writers from the sounds of their own voices as they talk about their work and then i'll ask follow up questions on each one here is the first for david and daisy who is this speaking
it's not no is it doris lessing yes i think it is it's not fay weldon i think it's more like doris lessing
it is indeed doris lessing very good indeed you get a supplementary question now daisy and david doris lessing was born in nineteen nineteen in which country was she born
she was born in northern rhodesia which is now zimbabwe southern rhodesia what is now zimbabwe erm and i can tell you something else about this which is in her golden notebook she has a commissar who she who she meets that's my dad as it happens my father appears both in her memoirs and in her book
that is incredibly interesting
bonus point it's not the right answer
really interesting
let's say south africa south africa
i know this you know this she submitted one of her manuscripts again to a whole load of editors and
what under another name under another name
under an anonymous name and they all said i can't remember what happened
i think that's good enough she wrote two novels under a pseudonym jane somers which were declined by her own u. k. publisher although they were accepted elsewhere very well done on that wendy and giles here's your recording again i want the name of the person who's speaking
i wrote short stories which got published aged about sort of seventeen eighteen and then my first novel after coming to live down in cornwall was the loving spirit and this was accepted by heinemann and was published
daphne du maurier
that was indeed daphne du maurier you're going to have two supplementary questions now three films directed by alfred hitchcock were based on stories or novels by daphne du maurier for your two points you have to tell me all three if you don't tell me all three it goes straight over to the other side
one's rebecca obviously erm yes one is i'm just thinking of her novels
it's chick lit i have no idea
you are so wide of the mark giles coren
he didn't do my cousin rachel frenchman's creek i'm gonna hand this
say north by northwest for your one point cos i hand it over i need all three
so rebecca the birds and marnie
no i'm afraid that's wrong it's rebecca the birds and jamaica inn now frenchman's creek was a film but it was directed by mitchell leisen let's move on to your second supplementary question as well as being the granddaughter of the novelist george du maurier and daughter of the actor gerald daphne was the cousin of which siblings who collectively inspired a work of children's literature
i'm thinking streatfields for some reason but i don't know if that's right say the streatfields if you want streatfields
that's the wrong answer do you think you could pick up a point here
it could be the llewelyn davieses who were the who were the models for peter pan and j. m. barrie
what a fantastic punt david but you're absolutely right now the score at the end of round two david and daisy have almost caught up with six points and wendy and giles are on seven
good stuff
now for your third round i'm going to show you a series of visual clues they may be literal or cryptic if you take them all together they should hopefully lead you to either the title of a work of literature or else way off in the entirely wrong direction so let's start this round with pictures for wendy and giles have a look at these which work of fiction do they suggest to you
there's always a coffin at the end somebody always dies at the end
what island is that that's what you have to not do
it embarrasses us for not knowing about geography does it look a little bit like japan er do you see it's clearly not is it cuba it looks like a crab they didn't laugh at cuba
there's daisy and there's a ja is this we've got a daisy
we're back on oh it's long island
it's gatsby it's long island this is the great gatsby
it is the great gatsby very well done just to take you through it it's a story of what fitzgerald called the jazz age and concerns nick carraway who's visiting his cousin daisy buchanan on long island sound daisy is driving gatsby's car when she hits and kills myrtle wilson with whom her husband tom was having an affair
i was named after that book were you my mother read the book in hospital and came across the phrase daisy's voice was full of money
you were lucky you weren't called myrtle interesting stories from you two
we're not even ten minutes in daisy and david which work of fiction is this
cigars mercedes benz some weird window thing a treasure chest and the eiffel tower i've no idea actually oh no it's the is it the count of monte cristo
ah monte cristo
cigars montecristo cigars a treasure
there's a prison on an island paris which he comes back to there mercedes his girlfriend you're a genius it's the count of monte cristo
you are a genius it is indeed the count of monte cristo by alexander dumas edmond dantes is about to marry his fiancee mercedes when he's arrested on suspicion of being a bonapartist and imprisoned on the chateau d'if where fellow prisoner abbe faria tells him about the treasure on the island of monte cristo which happens to share its name with a cuban cigar having found the treasure he returns to paris to exact his revenge very well done here's your next set of visual clues wendy and giles what novel is this
oh another island i just can't do geography
it's a bridge is that the bridge on the river kwai or anything like that oh gosh maybe it's what bridge is that
or a welsh rarebit maybe welsh rarebit yeah what's the bridge isn't there a dylan thomas bridge thing erm no
and what these are coracles these are people's coracles but what is this island
do you wanna just say bridge on the river kwai it's not a novel though
i'm just going to take it that you don't know
we really have a problem with this but i do recognise the island
oh woo hoo the island is haiti is it
and if that's the case i only actually know of one novel that has haiti in it which is the comedians
i'm afraid it's not the answer and you'll kick yourselves the answer is treasure island by robert louis stevenson
hispaniola the action of the novel opens in bristol
and continues in the ship hispaniola named after the island you see that's an island called hispaniola on treasure island jim hawkins encounters the marooned ben gunn and steals his makeshift coracle in order to sail out to the anchored ship
that's awful much better than the other way around
which is to dream of coracles and
that's a lot harder than the count of monte cristo
oh well let's look at david and daisy's final images what work do they represent
all right well magic bit of magic
storm a desert island or chalky island its not a desert island is it what's the antenna got where's the antenna got i think it is anyway but yeah
oh you know what it is it's the tempest that's what it is
it is indeed the tempest prospero and his daughter miranda have been marooned and with the help of the spirit ariel he conjures the tempest of the title which brings a ship carrying his enemies and friends to the island which island is that let's have a look at the scores at the end of round three and it just flipped around daisy and david are ahead with ten and wendy and giles are one point behind with nine so at this stage it's incredibly close and because wendy and giles are slightly behind they get the chance to decide which of four different categories their opponents have to answer questions on the point is to make sure that you choose a category you think your opponents will be completely appalling at but conversely you will shine at your choices are which of the four will you choose
those are the four things they know most about
oh don't throw me in the briar patch
what about historical novels bodice rippers does david look like a bodice ripper aficionado
excuse me
absolutely fantastic here's four questions daisy and david for each of the following i'll give you the briefest outline of an historical novel i want you to supply the title and the author first the year one thousand three hundred twenty seven and a series of murders in a benedictine abbey
the name of the rose umberto eco
the name of the rose by umberto eco is right twelfth century england the saxon knight wilford his allegiance to richard i and his love for rowena

yeah
blimey
tricky cos i'm sure they're very well up on all of those what do you think
is it that horowitz guy who was on before we beat him but it won't be repeated david
you're thinking of anthony horowitz it's the wrong answer over to daisy and david
i'm taking a really wild guess i've no idea but i think it might be eoin colfer called artemis fowl or something like that
it may be a wild guess but it's damned accurate it's artemis fowl by eoin colfer the relationship between fifteen year old steven connelly and the forty year old sheba hart featured in which two thousand three novel

and in nineteen seventy eight fifteen people spent an entire year living in the iron age
breakfast was almost always a porridge of boiled wheat with milk and honey if there was any
ronnie o'sullivan already knows what it takes to lift that trophy ali carter is learning fast they are the men in the spotlight on finals night tonight
don't get me wrong the one hundred forty seven can change life for carter it was probably the greatest moment of his career o'sullivan has done it before but the moment will still live with him forever when you have achieved perfection where do you go next how do you top that feeling there is only one way because when all is said and done the one for seven is a moment of glory the one hundred forty seven is a moment of glory but your name on the trophy is history l. got them both the one hundred forty seven and the world title which one means most no contest
good good evening cliff thorburn was the first in a quarter of a century on how fitting it is that both of these this is max and women and men have made it to the final of the eight eighty eight c. o. m. world championship ronnie o'sullivan and ali carter will have to share the jackpot but they cannot share the trophy right now ronnie has one hand on it
the first frame of the session was very important how this black quentin i will never know went in but at least it put a smile on ally's face but at the end of the frame he was cursing missed opportunities and another one went to run a
in frame eighteen ronnie o'sullivan got in first he lost position but played a good safety shot it was keep for ali carter to return the compliment with a good safety but he did not and it cost in the frame
frame nineteen and you are wondering where ali carter's next frame is coming from uncharacteristically ronnie o'sullivan made a mistake on the scoreboard not good position on the colour he missed the cut it left him needing snookers at last a framed to ali carter
the last frame before the midsession interval ali carter left to ronnie o'sullivan a chance he left ali carter any easier chance unfortunately it did not going and ronnie o'sullivan made seventy one did not go in
fourteen to six down carter did not give up he split the reds and made a frame winning eighty four
frame at twenty two was one of the scrappy frames it lasted almost half an hour in the end ronnie knocked in this
last frame of the session ronnie took a tricky red along the cushion he converted this one and went on to make a break of forty four and that paved the way to giving him the frame
sixteen to eight to ronnie o'sullivan whatever the match situation there is always eager anticipation in the crucible ahead of the final session of the world championship it has a packed crowd here to witness what happens will run the joint stephen hendry and steve davis as three time winner or will we see the most remarkable comeback will ronnie joined them let's hear from steve
davis alongside john parrott it looks like ronnie is looking to be crowned for the third time with that amount of talent it is only to be expected
performance a great couple of weeks and he will be richer financially and richer for that
a couple of
experience he could only have dreamed of
reaching the final here he will wake up a couple of days after this and be very proud of himself
ronnie looks set to be crowned but you never know
it is time to welcome the finalists first a man whose career has taken off over the last two weeks he has landed a place in that his first ever by law the captain ali carter first ever final and now prepare for lift off five four three two one it is the rocket ronnie o'sullivan well they have both earned around eighty thousand for making those maximum breaks tonight a cheque for two hundred fifty thousand is waiting to be added to the pay packet of one of these men it is looking like title no three thousand four hundred eighteen willie thorne and dennis taylor are in position willie thorne is indeed in the commentary box he is alongside dennis taylor this is going to be either a coronation or one hell of a comeback he has come on the floor he has taken his clothes off he will soon be removed back to normal the players have not even bothered smiling at somebody like that l. don't know why they bother
thank you settle down please thank you very much frame twenty five ronnie o'sullivan to break
off we go in this final session of the eight eighty eight c. o. m. world championship how many frames are we going to get this evening ronnie needing two wasn't it great to see ali carter when he was introduced to the crowd coming down those steps and smiling to everybody and waving to them quite rightly too he has been a sensation here over the last seventeen days is packed crucible would love to see a bit of a comeback willie but he can only do his best and play for
a bit of pride absolutely absolutely a little unlucky then not to get on to a colour after the kiss on the yellow he was better off not trying to play a part a pot
i think he is too close to the brown to come off the side cushion and nestle into the reds maybe he
can do it he has to put lot of side on this well played
touching ball touching ball has been called a good chance to get in behind yellow and green a big target but he has left it short the very consistent potting from ronnie o'sullivan
that is very consistent from ronnie for the whole tournament
it has to be said ronnie has not been at his fluent best in his final but his experience is making a big difference in this match ali carter has lost three or four frames at least that he should have won he has just got away with that safety he hit it far too thick but the red over the corner has been covered
he needs quite a thing contact because if he goes anywhere to the left of the brown as we look at it he will leave the red on over the left pocket he played that with
lots of check side and that is
perfect shot almost from ronnie o'sullivan that is the type of shot he played against stephen hendry in the semi final time after time stephen said that he had never played anyone who had put him in so much trouble
a lot of big celebrities come to watch snooker and there is the great dickie bird probably the world's greatest ever umpire he loves his snooker he lives just up the road in barnsley batty's and eddie charlton shot that is an
that shows you the trouble he was in that was always available to him for those of you that like to watch poker that is dave helm if one of the best poker players in the world with his girlfriend and that is the artist damien hirst who has been here for a good few sessions he loves his snooker brand new spectacles as well
it was not the best of opening reds from ronnie was it l. think he
must have got little bit of a
spring off the cushion because he was playing for the pink in the right hand middle that took off a little bit he is playing the pot into the corner this is not above fifty to fifty this one it is there
though he still needs another good pot though that pink was a gem wasn't it now the chance is there
two shut ago it looked like end of break now he is back in prime position two shot go two shot ago
you can tell by ronnie's reaction it is not a perfect position overall since the quarter final the tables are played very well in the one table situation there have been pretty good but he still that the as quick bounces off the cushions but you still get those quick bounces off the cushions his focus throughout the seventeen days has been terrific it really has he has kept his concentration and when he is like that he is unplayable at times as he proved against stephen hendry
along with stephen hendry he is one of the great break builders in the game we may never see the like of them again
ronnie o'sullivan wants to get this final over as quickly as possible the black will be enough
it was interesting see it was interesting to see ronnie played for this red played for that red
that was a little careless ali only needs one snooker he lost his concentration easy to do when you think you have won the frame ali has got three reds left he has to take black's of them he has to take the black off each he could afford to take a pink or blue
that was a quick look at ronnie's miss he can afford a pink he would like to get another red and black after this pink he can try for the free ball after the last red
the yellow green and brown her in pretty good positions for a snooker are this opening frame of the session is far from over here
the referee just giving the cue ball at clean would you not risked playing one more black him
he has a good chance to run the white up behind the yellow he can play it with lots of side or he can go twice across he has gone
twice across l. think he has found the gap a little bit unlucky there
he did not take a risk to pot the red look at the shot he has played it was highly unlikely he was going to win the frame anyway with the earlier break ronnie made he has won the frame he is now just one away from lifting the trophy after seventeen day snooker mathon ronnie is just a few strides away john and steve have both been in this position nice position i would imagine cue matt very much so
he was very fluent in that break he wants to get this over with as quickly as possible he has played magnificently he has undoubtedly been the best player he is one frame away from being crowned quite rightly the crucible came
totally deservedly he is the best player in the game by a street when he put his mind to it we had the same talk really about his performance at the u. k. championship he looks like he is on the verge of doing it the double which shows his domination of the game anything with long sessions ronnie o'sullivan is basically nigh on impossible to be unless he decides to beat himself could this possibly be ali carter's last break off here at the world championship looks a lot brighter this evening as if he is resigned to the fact it is over he looks relaxed for the
the top three or four players when they play that shot for nothing
just gone a fraction too high he has played a great shot to bring the pink into play this was an excellent shot he can still play for the red at the bottom of the
pack that is fine he looks pretty straight on the black he might have to punch it around to
he tried to run it past the red to leave it to the same pocket that he potted the black when he cannoned it it spoiled it
he was so cross there he felt it was a chance to take frame match championship at that visit
that is what he was trying to do then he would have had a nice easy pot it probably would have gone on
to take the frame and match ronnie o'sullivan thirty four
there is a very interested spectator very famous actor duncan preston
he loves his snooker not a bad golfer plays in a lot of charity events
he comes to the masters at wembley occasionally he loves his snooker a great actor
what does ali carter do here he has got one red that is a possible pot he really has kept his focus he is leading seventeen wade thirty four to nil in front
seventeen to wait one hundred seventy eight he takes some beating his his safety play is as good as anyone ronnie o'sullivan has won this championship on two occasions that is what they're playing for my friend and colleague ronnie o'sullivan his there as well can ronnie o'sullivan get his hat trick it looks likely as well
he acted defeat to former world champions stephen hendry and mark williams he had to defeat mark williams put up a great fight to stay in the top sixteen it was nine to seven at one stage ronnie dominated the final session
this what he is
that is just a little bit too far for one not quite far enough for another the other
just lost the cue ball at had a little that was a little bit dangerous i think he could have held it without making the case
he has still got one into the left corner making the kiss a little bit too hard but not bad took his eye off the pot he did not get on the blue as he intended he concentrated so much a muddy was doing with the white ball he took his eye off the pot
could that be his last shot he has been an absolute star this week o'sullivan has been the master of everybody he is very close to being the world champion again he would have needed a spider there if he was a right handed player it would have been difficult to use the spider to play a stun shot
just needs the blue he has been so consistent over the last seventeen days this crucible crowd would have loved to have seen this final continue and ali carter to have won a couple of frames but ronnie
o'sullivan has been the master l.
think ali carter will come forward ronnie o'sullivan really has been superb throughout the seventeen days this crucible crowd give him standing ovation ronnie o'sullivan becomes the two thousand eight world champion but well done to ali carter ronnie o'sullivan becomes the eighth player since nineteen twenty seven to win this title more than twice he joins steve davis and stephen hendry as the only men to claim the prize three terms ladies and gentlemen can ask you to show your appreciation for both finalists i wonder if we can grab a few words with ali carter ali congratulations you must be incredibly proud of yourself
pleased to get to the final disappointed i did not perform at my best it was very tiring ronnie made it very difficult his safety was difficult the better man one on the day
about the difficult situation you lost both you grandmothers but they were on your shoulder
already landed a one hundred forty seven how about land in that one hundred forty seven
take off from here
i hope so top eight in the world final of the world championships one hundred forty seven i would have taken that at the start of the championship
and fair to say ali your opponent was in decent form
can you describe what emotions you are experiencing
i am just happy to have won it it was tough because we both never got going l. got ahead you always think at the back of your mind that if you lose it from here it is going to be a killer it's sometimes better if it is closer you can get involved in the game but when you're trying to protect a lead it is hard if you are playing hard you can cruise on but i was struggling
he joined stephen hendry and steve davis as three times winners great company came up fantastic company
hopefully it is not the last hopefully there are few more to come
what impact does it have on you when people like steve davis say you're ahead of tiger woods and roger federer
mad people say i'm mad but he must be matt
but surely the way you played in the semi final against stephen hendry the you feel you have taken your game to a new level cue matt not really
i had just been a bit more consistent each of these matters are a long frame matches if i can contain and stick in there that is why a won it l. was not playing fantastic every session but sometimes you just have to do it in
we could not have put on a better performance sometimes when you get to the final it is not all about the performance sometimes you can struggle with you form little bit it is a tough place to think straight sometimes but that is why we look the pressure the excitement the atmosphere of the crucible and i love my family to
i would like to win the more it is quite well documented that i have struggled with the game and with myself sometimes i think wouldn't it be nice to go at on a high as world champion l. need some time to think over the summer it might be a good time to have a bit of a break who knows
added think over the summer everyone here and everyone at home wanted to play snooker
i like playing but sometimes i find it tough l. will hopefully be back next year if not at a great time and lost the support everybody has given me it has been great
not in the slightest he will be tired at the moment it is a big seventeen days it is a good effort to win here and he will have a few days off in the summer and relax and come back next year
ronnie at thirty two is the oldest man to have won this title for twenty two years since joe johnson how many more could he achieved
there is a possibility of more there are so many good players around four is very realistic and so is five it is down to run a how much he decides he wants to play the game rodney l. think he will be back next year and ronnie it gives power authorities the slight dilemma in that there is a disciplinary hearing coming up during the summer it puts a bit of pressure on that hearing generally he is a crowd favourite
he is going to lose a few pounds in that discipline the hearing i suspect a disciplinary hearing what is different about him since his victories in two thousand one and two thousand four what is better about his game
there is nothing too much better l. think he has had a great focus all year he has been concentrating on the job in hand this last two weeks he has been a credit himself and a credit to the game turn up play your best and if he does that he will win the trophy
tournament he was in a tough spot against hendry and he showed great patience he seems to be a lot calmer on the table but he obviously has the dilemma about whether he is enjoying himself and up he seems at home on the table if he loses that part of his game
missing his dressing room he has had the fantastic couple of weeks missing pots he has never reached this stage of the tournament before he has done fantastically well he can be very proud of himself
thinking back to experience you suffered at the hands of this man a few years ago you came back and won a couple of years later
you have no idea how difficult this tournament is to win it was such an eye opener for me the first there was happy to win it in the end
good evening this is jeremy vine and welcome to panorama who has been sent to low security jails that inmates can simply walk out of and why
the risk factor is massive the risk factor to the public the risk factor to the
i just feel he sticks his two fingers up to the justice system and seems to always get away with it
prisons are using a more subtle technique to ease the overcrowding one that won't have a political price because it's happening out of the public gaze but it hasn't gone unnoticed among those who work inside the system
i've certainly been worried for fifteen to eighteen months that individuals were being transferred into open jails in england and wales who did pose a risk to the public the reason i believe that is because members of my organisation working in prisons and in the community have told me that that's the case
information i'm receiving from my members that they're getting the wrong prisoners the wrong inmates the wrong offenders wifrpl expression you want to use into the open jail that's been caused by the overcrowding situation we have both in scotland and in england and wales
mr. macdonald is very well known to us the british transport police have had dealings with him for armed robbery since nineteen ninety four the c. c. t. v. was shown to one of the robbery squad officers who was on the squad in nineteen ninety four and he identified the robber as being mr. macdonald which was most surprising because we believed mr. macdonald was in prison serving for robberies on the railway at that time
d. c. burnham was right to be surprised richard macdonald had been jailed for eight years in two thousand three for armed robbery and was still meant to be serving that sentence but just three years later he was sent to ford open prison macdonald walked out and took up where he left off robbing railway stations
i certainly don't think an open prison is a place for someone like mr. macdonald who is just a professional armed robber can't see the sense in him being in an open prison because the fact is it's just an invitation for him to leave the prison and just cut short his sentence
should be deemed suitable for transfer to an open prison it is unacceptable that these resettlement institutions are now coming under such pressure that we see the risk of absconding and therefore a risk to the public
what the governor of ford was saying then has become very true we have the wrong people in the wrong places and that puts society at greater risk
the problem isn't just that prisoners are walking out of open jails inmates are also given the chance to spend a lot of time out and about in the community as part of their rehabilitation and they get to go home on leave completely unsupervised now the justice ministry in england and wales couldn't tell us how much home leave is being granted but it's a different picture in scotland if you look at the scottish figures over the last four years the amount of home leave has tripled that's because there's been a huge increase in the number of prisoners who are being allowed out for a week at a time we went back to the former governor of an open prison who had agreed to guide us through our investigation leave is essential because the capacity of the prison is built around up to a quarter of the population being out on leave at any time that way it can house many more prisoners than it has beds prisoners like kenny henry a convicted killer he was transferred to castle huntly open prison near dundee at first glance the former castle with its extensive grounds could be mistaken for a golf and country club while he was here henry was allowed to go to greenock near glasgow on leave one week every month this came as a shock to catherine hamilton the mother of the man he stabbed to death particularly when in november last year henry after a week's home leave didn't go back to the jail he went on the run
a friend from greenock had phoned and said they had been reading the greenock telegraph and it said that kenneth henry was on the run apparently he had escaped well he was due to go back to the open prison but he was now on the run it took me long time to accept that my son is not coming back l. want to try to get on with my life but when i hear about him in the papers all the time it brings back all the feelings
system and always seems to get away with it it makes me feel i don't have any faith in the justice system any more
he had raped and done so quite violently according to my friend they were the same kind of injuries that his wife had had only that my friend had survived
he asked if i had a brother called
worrying what were these people with their track records and attitude to the justice system doing in open jails in the first place everyone who is sent to an open prison should have been assessed to make sure they don't pose a risk to the public they are not likely to escape and they have co operated fully with the system the people who do that risk assessment are probation officers they are telling their union leader harry fletcher that it is not working
the key is to assess how many have gone having not completed their offender management programmes and or aren't suitable for daily release for employment or what have you
because it's a matter of public safety a matter of public concern a matter of public protection
could it be the case that the government does know it's just
so dangerous criminals are wrongly being sent to open prisons and going on the run you would assume the priority for the authorities is to catch them and put them back inside we have learned at least one hundred forty nine prisoners who have escaped from open prisons are still at large among them convicted murderers armed robbers and drug smugglers this is the red scorpion crewed by three dutch men in two thousand it was boarded by customs officers as it sailed around the north coast of scotland they found forty three million worth of cannabis the biggest drugs haul of its kind ever in scotland the crew were convicted of drug smuggling and one of them was sentenced to ten years in jail in two thousand five he was moved to an open prison his response was to walk out while on weekend leave with over half his sentence still to be served three years later he is still on the run so we decided to travel to his native holland and try to find him now we don't have much to go on and what we do have is out there in the public domain we have a few telephone numbers from the dutch phone book we have a photograph and we have a rough idea where he is living so we have given ourselves twenty four hours to try and track down this man we started by phoning neighbours and visiting his family it paid off we got a tip he was back living in his hometown den helder and running a small taxi business we found his cab so we parked up and waited not for long though christian ekkebus is clearly living openly here we had seen him and he had seen us and that it would appear is mr. christian ekkebus living in a terraced street running a taxi here in den helder when in fact he should still be in prison in scotland we weren't going to leave it at that we wanted to speak to him so we waited for him to return home can i have a quick word with
sentence in scotland didn't you l.
open prison in the u. k. while he was on weekend leave
christian ekkebus clearly enjoys being something of a celebrity he's kept all the newspaper cuttings but even he doesn't think he should have been put into an open prison
this is one big joke l. was surprised that they left me to go up there l. know in the dutch jail if a foreigner is living in there he is not entitled to go into an open jail l. was surprised
when we headed back to the u. k. our next step was the find out why christian ekkebus hadn't been found and taken back to prison scottish prosecutors said they were aware he was living in holland and they did want to get him back but they claim legal loopholes meant that they couldn't extradite a dutch citizen who had absconded from a scottish prison which begs the obvious question why risk putting him into an open jail with five and a half years potentially still to go on his sentence we had come to the end of our journey and we wanted to put what our investigation had found to the people who have the answers but despite repeated requests jack straw the minister responsible for prisons in england and wales wouldn't agree to an interview he did give us a statement though absconds are falling but we don't know what the trend is for failures to return and you need both figures to know the true number of people escaping the ministry can't or won't tell us despite a freedom of information request made by panorama the scottish prisons service did agree to meet us that same week they had been at the centre of another open prison scandal an escapee had raped a woman while on the run overcrowding does have an effect on open prisons saying the s. p. s. accept the kind of prisoner going to open prison has changed in their terms more difficult prisoners are being sent there
we are putting a different type of prisoner to open prison and people may be remarking on that we are doing it it is quite deliberate and we see that it is in the interests of a safer scotland that we do that we are dealing we are planning more and programming more for difficult prisoners to ensure trying to ensure that they don't
i don't want to comment on an e. mail that i haven't seen and i haven't had a chance to evaluate myself but what i would read from what you have said is that we probably have more of a communication process to go through with our staff in castle huntly and elsewhere to explain the changes we have gone through we have deliberately gone through and let them understand the reasons for it
you could categorically deny there is a link between overcrowding and unsuitable prisoners being pushed
people we have spoken to but no one we have interviewed for this programme thinks we should get rid of open prisons the argument from the people who work in them is that a valuable part of the prison system is itself being abused
we should go back to rigorous assessment and we may have to keep people in the closed estate longer so we have to invest in the closed estate the other side is we put people into open conditions they abscond from open conditions and continue their criminality that puts everyone at risk
the aspirations of today's british teenagers have changed
let me get the girls out
in a recent survey of girls aged fifteen nineteen almost two thirds admitted that glamour modelling is their dream job
i want this so much and i don't want to go home
but it is a cut throat industry
if we were selling armpits that would be a shot
few make it to the top
no point starting unless hair and make up's perfect
for the first time in thirty years glamour agency samantha bond management opens its doors to reveal the tears
but they said i was so good
and you are you are good
the tantrums
you've been in the sport don't put me down cos i've done topless in nuts
and the pressures
they said that i was fat
this is life as a glamour girl
modelling's not as glamorous as people think it is
coming up amanda flies to miami in a bid to break the states
they're unorganised totally unorganised
comeback kid anna discovers just how much industry has changed
if someone had saggy boobs they'd sellotape them there was no retouching at all
an experienced glamour girl louise tastes life behind the camera
turn more your bum to me that's it look over your shoulder that's it
at samantha bond h. q. in chelsea they're booking girls for a big international casting major models a multi million dollar italian agency with offices in milan new york and paris is on a global search they want tall curvaceous models for major italian brands
it's prestigious for a model to say she's been modelling there especially a glamour model the agency we work with is a high fashion agency but they like our girls because they're more curvaceous for lingerie and swimwear and advertising and it's wonderful for those girls to experience working with a big agency like that
one girl the agents think would be perfect for the job is former fashion model ella cole but she's seventeen so the agents have called her in today to make sure she's prepared for the rigours of the industry
when i was about fourteen i seen well as we knew her then jordan do you know and she was like my idol from friends and things i haven't had a lot of support about me going into it especially girls they're very sort of sort of turn their nose up at it but at the end of the day a lot of them are out at clubs pulling their tops off doing it for free and i'm going to get paid
but you're still only seventeen aren't you you say that you want to glamour which is fine you had a problem in the fashion area didn't you i did
i was in fashion to begin with and i came out of it really cos of the pressures that are on you i just
in what way did you find the pressure what was the pressure
the pressures of the whole body image
but in the glamour industry also girls seem to think they've got to run off and have plastic surgery which is the thing that we have to contend with with girls i hope you don't have any thoughts like that
no i don't i don't know i think personally i like the natural look i think the glamour modelling is great because it does promote the female form it's on women's side it is on the woman's side
that is it absolutely
for a young girl you are probably more clued up than a lot of the older girls
satisfied that ella's going into this with her eyes open they put her up for the italian job in liverpool amanda harrington is preparing for her trip to miami she has already found an agent there
i'm just not organised one bit i don't even know what time my flight is
the twenty seven year old single mum has been on sam's books for a year but has so far refused to model topless concentrating on swimwear and lingerie shoots
i am the worst packer anyway every time i go away i take a million times more than what i need
amanda's agent in miami has lined up some test shoots for american magazines
the agency that took me on is like a really good agency over there it's like one of the best ones and they seem to be really like planning stuff for me to do it's just different as well because as i was saying the other day i just don't think i can get any further in what i'm doing over here because i won't do topless and stuff so hopefully over there it's a different market over there and they haven't seen me before
determined to pursue her dream of making it in america amanda is investing two thousand of her own money to try where many others have failed
it could change my whole life really so that is what i'm hoping cos it's time for a change
her trip is only possible because the family are prepared to look after her daughter savannah while she's away
it is like loads of families there's a lot of parents who work away but have to work away all week and are only home on weekends but that's your job and how you make your money to pay for nice things and to pay for your house and your car so you've got to do what you've got to do give us a big squeeze i nearly dropped you then go on go back in bye say bye bye mummy love you bye bye
in east london louise glover is preparing for a photo shoot except today she'll be behind the camera louise has been an international glamour icon for six years but now feels squeezed out of the market by the demand for celebrity cover shots
i've worked with good photographers in america and i felt so proud of myself cos they said i was so good is it heavy
louise started taking photos two years ago with top photographers earning up to three hundred thousand a year this might be a shrewd move
excellent want a wind machine
no
today she's going to be photographing a big name in glamour with the help of photographer andy le sauvage
shall i just put the black panels around to slim out not for the white ones
you need to put as much white in there as possible
yes you can get that much closer
it is going to be very beneficial futuristically for me cos i have been doing it for a couple of years now and i'm building up and building up and getting better i'm also showing girls how to pose how to act how to be in front of the camera i'm always picking something up of them as a model as well so it's a clever little way for me to still learn new techniques for my modelling
jackie degg has been a glamour model for ten years she's worked with some of the best in the business
that's cute yeah look over your shoulder more that's the one what oh right yeah sorry help with the
louise needs to make her subject comfortable
is it awkward not bad it is awkward i can tell in your voice great pose that's it right real good mistake here what have we done with the socks
i know it's not the best is it i did think that
how many years have you been modelling
for years we've been shooting together she picks up a lot behind the camera she's got the gift of the gab and she's talking to the models the whole time she has the attention of the model to the camera and keeps rolling she's doing brilliant
that's the one they look cool
it's nine o'clock in miami and amanda harrington meets her new agent rock anderson she's hoping the president of icon models will be her passport to the u. s. glamour scene
she has tremendous genetic bone structure she has good lines in her face very high cheekbones wide set eyes straight nose pouty lips but they fit her face her chin's not too long she has all the components of a very almost a cosmetically attractive commercial cosmetic face and then you put that on top of the fact that she has a swimsuit body and you have the makings of a good glamour model a lot of glamour models don't have her don't have the face they don't have a cover girl make up face to go with the rest of it you don't want to just get pigeonholed all you can do is just glamour you want to be able to go beyond that and begin to do commercial glamour which is health fitness you know and that stuff health means healthy lifestyle everything from water to energy drinks to
i want to do waxing or something i just don't want to do fitness magazines
google women's fitness no i can't be bothered google it so she can see what we mean
i don't want to look like a fitness model
amanda's american dream might not be quite what she had in mind it's the morning of the milan casting mariano from major models is flying to london to meet the four girls the agents have selected for him the girl he chooses will be flown to milan all expenses paid for two weeks of test shoots with italian advertisers
i'd love to get the chance to go out to milan and work it'd be totally awesome it'd be just a dream come true
with mariano due any minute the agents have a problem the model they had high hopes for today twenty one year old page three girl rhian hasn't turned up
hi it's nikki we have mariano here you were going to see him give me a call and let me know what's going on
nice to see you again sorry for the delay traffic planes and everything that's fine very sorry samantha how are you hi darling nice to see you again
mariano arrives and they quickly explain rhian's absence
rhian is poorly at the moment she can't come down she's in manchester absolutely you'd love her shall i go and get you established in the boardroom
can you burn a copy of her new pictures have we got a disc to burn a copy yep fantastic
proof that a girl's portfolio really counts even though she's not there in person rhian's still in with a chance
you can leave your coat i can leave it
in miami amanda has her work cut out if she wants to convince her agent rock that she's cover girl calibre
it's different over here with the modelling in england they want all the models all glamour models and all that to do topless that's all they want you to do over here they don't want that they do not want it this is why i'm happy working over here over here they love the bikini shoots and the underwear the lingerie shoots but they just don't think like they look at topless like porn honest
but just as she prepares for her first beach shoot agent rocks rings with bad news the photographer has dropped out
why couldn't florence do it again he wasn't can you tell i don't know in the next half hour ugh unorganised totally unorganised i've got to get my make up done in the next half hour it's just not going to happen is it
the replacement photographer is only available an hour ahead of schedule amanda's got thirty minutes to get across miami and into make up on strict instructions from sam bond twenty seven year old anna taverner is having a portfolio redone by photographer andy this book is like derelict basically sam completely rinsed me for it because i kind of like didn't go to castings for so long it's all over the place it's a complete mess three years after quitting the former page three star wants to make a comeback sam needs her to retake her photos to see if she's still got what it takes
oh anna yeah there's not one here i can say yeah that one
every glamour girl needs a killer portfolio to sell her to clients
why put a nude picture on the front of a card not just a nude picture but one that looks like i'm taking a dump on the beach it's the worst picture i could have put on there sam just said i need to change my whole book she's not happy with it she said this is all old school glamour you need to update it
as anna is in make up louise glover is just leaving a good opportunity to compare notes
hi honey i'd love to get some shots in with you everyone says your stuff's really good
do you want to get more into commercial
sam has just kind of looked in my book and gone get rid of the glamour
i'm in the same situation i've been in the same situation a lot of my stuff was glamour going to america it's a bit too high glamour it's nice to have andy's pictures within the glamour range
yeah still sexy
lollipop glamour or your tits and arse glamour it's more of a beautiful it's bringing a beauty out in you that's what's good about working here thank you have fun see you later
we'll keep it simple at first just going to shoot some beauty head shots
do i want to have something really smiley
there'll be a top light above you use your hands round here don't try and be glam i'm going to beat that out of you that's fine can we get rid of the t. shirt we've got a towel you can just use that's nice that's beautiful not too glam that's glam try and keep it a bit more natural as you would naturally do it
despite her experience anna needs to learn a new style of posing to fit today's more natural look
who the hell are you give me that look who the hell are you that's nice
i'm really looking forward to being able to walk into samantha bond and whack down a load of pictures that she doesn't rib me for for being too glam and too old school that's what i'm looking forward to if she has anything bad to say i'm going to be like
in chelsea the italian casting is well underway
so when did you start modelling
i've been doing it about five years now
give me a profile it's nice to meet you too
thank you thank you
how tall are you five f. t. five mariano nice to meet you hi please have a seat
next up is youngest girl on the books ella
did you travel have you been to spain italy france no
it's terrible would you like to stand up for me first
put back your hair hold it give me a profile other one
he said he's going to keep in touch with the agency so um i don't know i'll have to sit wait and see it's quite nerve racking
i'll have to sit tight now and fingers crossed
twenty three year old mutiat ademolah is on a mission to be britain's first black glamour superstar she's one of only five black and asian models on sam's books
as a black model you never think to try glamour modelling you just think well that's mostly for blonde girls with blue eyes because times are changing the industry the glamour industry is requesting more and more black girls there is a market and they do need them so rather than like be one of many in the fashion industry i thought i'd become a unique face in the glamour industry
blondes have always been the most popular in this particular industry but i think we need some different images new looks
there's a move away from the typical blonde girl with big boobs that's not the normal look there's not hundreds of blonde girls with big boobs walking round you want to see a mix the idea is more representative of just the everyday girl really
few black or asian women have appeared on the covers of british lads mags the jury's out on whether it's the lack of supply or demand
there's naomi campbell in the fashion industry and no one in the glamour industry to compete with so it just seemed like a smart idea
the next day anna taverner is back at andy's studios to see how her shots turned out
hello hello i'm back good i have to tiptoe to kiss you cos you're too tall or you're just too short all the girls are too short
in the three years she's been away technology has made a glamour girl's life a little easier
yeah it's like all smoothed out isn't it
thing is there's like four hundred ways to retouch every person's got their own way of doing it that is so clever so that's that little bit there done
i want to have a machine that does that in the morning how on earth are those adjustments being made it's drawing
that's all i'm doing it's almost like drawing with a pencil
i've gone all the way through from when quite literally how the polaroid was was how we ended up in the newspaper the next day there was not any retouching if someone had saggy boobs they
stayed saggy they sellotaped them up
there was no retouching at all if you had like a label showing on your clothes you were in the newspaper the next day with the label nothing was done at all and now you've just showed me that and it's taken a matter of minutes it's incredible
is there anything you want changed with that before i do a final
no and stretch it like that did you just lengthen my legs i bloody love this photograph excited so many people retouch so you're almost like a cartoon character i actually don't believe that and i don't believe in models that base their entire careers on being retouched i think there's some girls that aren't really models but they've been really successful and it's based on retouching and it being possible to get away with it otherwise i don't think it's fair i think that's the thing sam's looking for i love it
in cheshire new sam bond girl amy diamond is having some home snaps taken the agency need to see if amy looks as good on camera as in person before sending her to the professionals
now mum no offence to you now or anything but i've asked catherine round because i think catherine should take the pictures on me camera i know your eyesight isn't great
it's because i'm so good with cameras
i think we've got the best of a bad bunch i am quite nervous about taking these pictures but i'm in my own house with my mum and me best friend and we're having a cup of tea and a chat i think whether i'm right for page three or not they still seem to think i could work in this industry so it's worth a shot that's why you're not taking the pictures
after chrissie spotted amy on the tube sam immediately saw her potential and arranged a hair makeover
not very glamour model at the minute is it
mum margaret and best friend cat are taking the photos they have to get a variety of shots to send to sam bond
when she told me she was spotted on the underground she told me over the phone that it was samantha bond and that she was a reputable agency i've got to say i have been slightly apprehensive all the way through she's my daughter and she's only a young girl
hang on let me get the girls out
right what do we press that one
amy's unhappy with the photos and feels it's her sam bond haircut that's causing the problems
i think it's me hair i think cos i've been changed i'm just not used to seeing pictures of meself with like not as blonde hair
you don't feel as glamorous
no i don't
strip off for me baby
i always thought i was a good photographer it was always one of my little fortes in life taking
you're not quite david attenborough
no david bailey
finally she needs to get some topless shots to send to the agents
i'm gonna be cheeky and close the door on you now i'll let you know when i've finished bye

we're just on our way to the make up now are we still doing it on the beach
will amy's home snaps launch a thousand magazine covers
i hope in the pictures i'll look relaxed and not like a scared rabbit in headlights
and can louise cope with being behind the lens instead of in the spotlight
hello
i called you here as free born englishmen loyal to our king since prince john has seized the regency guy of gisborne and the rest of his traitors have murdered and pillaged you've all suffered from their cruelty the ear loppings the beatings the blindings
it's time we put an end to this
this system of scattered holdings has remained unchanged through the centuries the autumn ploughing is the best time to get a good idea of the strips'
well this is a basic fromity
fromity what's a fromity
it's a cracked grain sort of porridge really and you would mix it with stock or ale or anything like that then you'd put in the things we grow in the garden so today we're just coming out of lent so we've got a bit of kale and a bit of flat leaf parsley and some onions which i'll just stick in of course these are quite strong flavours they're going to flavour the grain for you and it'll be hopefully quite tasty you'd have had this on its own or you could put it with some meat if you were rich enough
how's this doing are we can we sample it
well you can sample some if you would like to i can't guarantee the taste but you are welcome
well this is experimental archaeology you see so we've got to do that
well let's get some for you then do you want some bread
just a bit of that so these are ordinary peas here are they
they're dried peas so i've just put them in there basically to soak and we would soak them for quite a while really
so peas would be a part of their diet too they would right and they ate off wood they did
you'd have a bowl for everything you know we've got wooden buckets and plates and spoons happy eating
it's very good i don't know whether i could manage this every day but
it's very heavy
christina's parents were smallholders their most valuable possessions their plough oxen and their cow
as a medieval peasant you had to be averagely good at a lot of things you didn't have many professional woodsmen back in the middle ages you were just a farm worker doing woodland work because it was necessary to your year
so what's the deal with being able to do the peasants have a common land or common wood where they can do this or do they have to get permission from the landlord
if they're tenants of the landlord often their rental payment will cover gathering certain types of wood and sometimes in certain quantities this is actually where you get the difference between wood and timber wood was generally the stuff that peasants were allowed to gather locally around here it was stuff up to about four inches thick timber was a commercial product it didn't necessarily mean you were going to build anything out of it it just meant it belonged to the land owner and he could sell it so the landowner would be keen for the woodlands on the estate to have lots of what we'd call standard trees ones that will grow to their full height whereas the peasantry wanted lots of coppice or pollard trees where they'd get lots of these poles
and you get the firewood as well the thicker stuff
at the bottom for firewood the straight bits in the middle for fencing the twigs at the top that i'm sitting on here you can actually make beds out of them but most would be tied into bundles called faggots and they would be used to heat your bread ovens
now on one level you might think that this is just an everyday story of medieval country folk but there's more to it than that here in fourteenth century hertfordshire christina and her neighbours are already set on the path which will lead england to become the first capitalist nation in history money money money thou art king said a poet of the time and rulest the world over all by the late thirteenth century money was in wide circulation and markets were opening everywhere where peasants could sell their surplus the first step to freedom
i do barn eggs i do duck eggs i do quail eggs
the nearest big market saint albans was already here in one thousand eighty six
i think it goes back to at least the eleven to twelve hundreds i'm sure it does it might even go back a bit before that my father in law's had a stall here for about thirty years and my son's working here as well so that's three generations and my husband's grandma used to work on the stall with his father as well so at one time when tom was a baby there were four generations on the stall
christina's parents leased a stall in a new market in codicote you might think it almost impossible to recover the thirteenth century from a modern commuter village but it's still here that's the main road from hitchin to saint albans medieval road pilgrims' road in fact the george and the dragon was built there in the fourteenth century as a pilgrims' hostel in one thousand two hundred sixty seven the king allowed the villagers to have a market and this is the marketplace it's been filled in with these cottages in later times but this is where all the market stalls were fish stalls along there for salted fish the fleshmongers the butchers the tanners the coopers and so on all around here and it's this point in the story of england as well as the story of the village that you see the growth of capitalism at the grass roots christina herself was born around one thousand two hundred eighty five at the end of a boom time in two hundred years the population had gone from two million to six and with the king needing to feed his court and fight his wars this was the real beginning of the english tax system there's one hundred seventy five kms of shelving here in the stores of the national archive the records of the english and the british state for one thousand years almost these shelves contain the court rolls of the thirteenth and fourteenth century nothing to my mind gives a better idea of the capacity of a medieval government to gather information than to tax even the poorest people down to the level of christina and her father hugh cok these are pieces of parchment that are sewn together to form the long roll see the sewing on the first strip here it's just fantastic isn't it of course you have to remember it's not organised by modern local government blocks it's organised on hundreds which are the divisions of the shire it had to be right at the end didn't it so we know where we are because this is the hundred of cashi and here codicote and the twenty nine taxable people of codicote in one thousand three hundred seven they're people with enough property shop in the market land cottage and so on to be taxable all of them would have been well known to christina and her family the arnolds there's still an arnolds' farm in codicote there's still a thickney roger polin they end up being one of the wealthiest villein families in the fourteenth century did very well out of all the crises of the time and hugh cok christina's father his tax rating thirteen pence and three farthings in one thousand two hundred seventy seven he'd been estimated at six pennies so he's more than doubled his tax liability after thirty years of hard slog out in the fields of codicote if you want to understand the medieval mind you have to remember this that along with death the other great constant is tax then as now money meant social mobility it brought peasants property and even education and literacy and it shaped the class system that the english have loved and hated ever since there were quite big class divisions poor people on one side like christina and rich families like the salecoks and the polins who built up quite big estates and properties shops they might have been able to afford to build themselves a fine house like this with a little hall and a bedroom at one end so social change was in the air and in the art of the time too this most beautiful of all medieval books was commissioned in christina's lifetime by a rich lord sir geoffrey luttrell
it's just so rare for the middle ages for anything concerning the great unwashed to make it through we're used to it being the realms of time team and pot shards etc but here you've actually got it red of tooth and claw and the scenes that run around the marginal space in this incredible book populated not just by the great and the good but by the ordinary people who made luttrell p. l. c. tick and that's an incredibly brave thing for a patron to actually want to do
so these are real people oh real people
and this is a century in which we're beginning to experiment with portraiture imagine the thrill of these people in the household if they saw this thing in the church seeing themselves too and you can say something from the subsidy roles etc of how much these estates were worth each year but if we want to see what makes the man tick and how he's seeing his universe this is the best route in it's very rare for somebody to leave something that personal i think one of the things that runs throughout the agenda is a concern with social justice with poverty and posterity
just look around you wrote william langland especially at the women among the poor burdened with children often famished with hunger their lot is too hard for me to describe in poetry now christina's father knew that and when she reached her late teens he passed on to her his property in the market the house and shop with its yard and garden hugh gives over these holdings and tenements to his daughter christina on condition that he will still hold them in name for the rest of his lifetime so he maybe has become infirm maybe you know hard work for thirty years as a villein ploughing his lord's fields as well as his own has really finished him off christina's parents also brewed and sold ale brewing traditionally was a woman's trade and christina will have learned the job when she was young
you just pour it in and you have to keep the temperature just below simmering the whole time the mashing process forces the sugar out of the malted barley into the liquid which will eventually be called wort and the liquid is what you're going to turn into the ale
so medieval women who are brewing ale literally will spend two hours over their hot bowl doing this each day that they brew ale
yes it's quite a careful process and one that i think they would have been very skilled in because it was their main drink it was their daily drink
god i'm starting to smell it now i feel as if i'm in a medieval brewery now
i think women would have almost used it like cooking they would have added all sorts of ingredients like nettles or dandelions to flavour their own ale and had their own personal recipes
in the village book christina's parents were fined for breaking the assize of ale now christina herself had to deal with this notorious area of medieval life controlled by the ale tasters
make way for the high bailiff ale tasters and members of the ancient henley court and their guests
i command you to draw a glass of your beer and give it to my ale tasters that they may taste it and judge of its quality
the excesses that all the women brewed they wanted to sell and with the act to actually sell it in theory they needed to put a pole outside their garden outside their house with a brush on it to indicate to the ale tasters to come and taste it to make sure that it was fit for consumption and sale
port of codicote the feast of saint mark the ale tasters present that christina blosten agnes boner ralph the miller have brewed ale and sold it contrary to the assize of ale and are fined so for a peasant whether you were ploughing or brewing you ignored the law at your peril
it's a very bureaucratic period there are all sorts of rules and regulations if you break them you have to pay money to a lord or whoever has control of the market or whoever has control of the land where you put your dung heap so there'd be a lot of very local litigation which was really a means of somebody raising money but there were other courts and forms of law local courts manorial courts or court leet as they were called and also of course the church was a huge landowner when disputes arose about church property they would often be tried in the church courts because they had jurisdiction over it which were sometimes called consistory courts
christina's landlord the earthly agent of christ's great consistory court in the sky was saint albans abbey by the thirteen hundreds saint albans abbey was an ancient and wealthy centre of power and privilege it was founded on what was supposed to be the oldest christian shrine in britain of a roman saint alban the monks had been endowed by the saxon king offa in the eighth century the lands of codicote had been given to the monks in one thousand two by king ethelred the unready so by christina's day the people of codicote had worked for and been owned by the king and the church for many centuries dear oh dear those medievals were shorter and smaller than me well if the abbot of saint albans ever came up here which i can't believe he did having been up that narrow staircase he'd have been able to look out over his domain and pretty much as far as the eye could see was land that belonged to the monks
i christyn dohtyr of hugh cok tak this londe in villenage to holden for me and myne and i woll do alle maner service and costomes and in alle thyngis i woll obeye the wylle of the lorde
as through most of our history the system was loaded against women one thousand five hundred thirty nine
absolutely do you want to open it a long time ago
that's why christina's father while he was still alive set her up with property so she wasn't dependent on a man and it's why she will always insist on it passing down through her heirs' so these are the court rolls for norton aren't they just to the north of codicote
yes they have been made into books rather than rolls which is quite interesting quite unusual
the truth was that a peasant needed to know the law and if you were smart enough and if you could read a little you could use it to your advantage there we go here's the tale alice who was the wife of richard le bounde alice le bounde she's a widow she's a villein she's a semi free peasant and she's come here to make her petition the lord's sergeant has unjustly taken as death duty from her husband this property which should have come to alice on the grounds of her hereditas it had come to her through her family but the judgement that was made was that her marriage she had been married only by the licence of the lord and that this property could then be taken as death duty and nothing go to her because the man is the head of the woman and i can hear you saying how medieval is that but before you jump to conclusions don't forget that arguments like this over the married woman's property continue right through the victorian era even after the married women's property act of one thousand eight hundred eighty two the road to women's equality even in britain has been long and difficult and not yet in some areas achieved so if christina were looking for a husband she needed to be careful christina's i think in her late twenties and she's got property so she's potentially a catch is she even though she's a villein woman
her father saw to it that she had some property it's interesting that it's market property that would have meant that she was up and about she travelled she moved it's really interesting the early fourteenth century is probably the peak of pressure on availability of landed resources in england the population is really really growing and we find many many cases enrolled of men that are clearly younger marrying women that are older and with property these are definitely working relationships she has something to offer she's not being coerced into this she's made a choice and to have a young vigorous interested man perhaps of some talent or skill around the place is as we know extremely useful she would know the value of documentation the fact that she's involved in market activity means she has to be aware of the importance of documentation of licensing and of leaving that dare i say the parchment trail yeah
and her parchment trail now leads us to one thousand three hundred fourteen and a husband she's making provision for a property in the market with a man called william baron and special provision for its descent through her true heirs so she's thinking about children there were many dangers in pregnancy then so you sought all the help you could get you might pray to a great saint like alban or a local holy woman like her namesake christina of markyate but you might also turn to magic
there was a beautiful classical cameo matthew paris our famous historian monk drew a picture of it and this was thought to be very effective for fertility we hear about women laying it on themselves lying down and placing it on their stomach
so you could imagine our christina made a pilgrimage to this shrine and laid the magic onyx stone on her belly and prayed to alban for children
gosh you would pray wouldn't you
such dreams were the refuge of the medieval mind but medieval life was governed by hard reality
if there wasn't much to go round the boys and men got it because they were working in the fields so the women wouldn't have weighed enough to be fertile so you brought your thin little wife on a pilgrimage asking permission
what weight is about seven and a quarter stone is the optimum weight for fertility to begin menstruation so christina's nearly thirty now seven or eight stone maybe she's already had a hard life and two babies are on the way there's rarely a perfect time to have children but one thousand three hundred fourteen was not one at this point the british isles and northern europe slip into catastrophic climate change a pattern of wet summers and frozen winters led to starvation and then to disease and pestilence in men and beasts the great famine modern studies of tree rings and ice cores have found a long term picture that they couldn't see two centuries of cooling europe's little ice age it was a time they said so cold and unkind to see what the famine was like for christina and her neighbours we can go to one hertfordshire farm that was still a working farm with two huge medieval barns when these photos were taken in nineteen thirty six the fourteenth century barn is now an architects' office and here we've got the incredible survival of almost day to day records from that time
this is the entry for kinsbourne on the sixteenth day of january and the accounting official is william attherne then it lists initially the different types of crops starting with wheat then peas barley then this damaged area says dredge which is a mixture of barley and oats and then finally oats at the bottom of the document there is a list of livestock which includes twelve horses and five cows also there's a young animal who is pregnant
and here at kinsbourne the farm diary can take us into the worst days of the famine
the chronicles for this period of the great famine talk about rains through july august into september for two or three years running in the worst period of the famine have you got evidence of that we've got evidence
from kinsbourne of those heavy rains which struck in one thousand three hundred fifteen and one thousand three hundred sixteen especially this is the section for the autumn expenses in the period of wet weather the entry starts here with the purchase of ale for the reeve and the cowman and various other farm servants more than usual because of the great rain proctor magnum pluvium presumably this means that the harvest period has had to be extended and so they were paid extra and they're being paid in ale which was a foodstuff this is quite an interesting entry because the auditor has been through disallowing some of the expenses they didn't believe that so much ale had been consumed and they reduced the amount of ale that they allowed from ten shillings and sixpence down to seven shillings and eight pence
so the poor peasants of kinsbourne in the middle of the great famine are ploughing fields late because of the pouring rain and the landlord is penny pinching over their ale expenses fantastic detail isn't it absolutely amazing is it always profit and loss and cutting your expenses or is there a sense of charity or sympathy in the documents or do documents not tell you that kind of thing well they do actually
many of these account rolls have been searched for this particular period and it seems that charity was rather lacking at the time there are some examples of the lord relaxing certain services or dues or obligations but also there are examples of them actually cutting food rations to their workers because of the price of corn
and believe it or not the worst year for the people one thousand three hundred sixteen was the best year for the landlord's profits if you'd been able to take this bird's eye view in the worst time of the great famine through the summer of one thousand three hundred fifteen or one thousand three hundred sixteen you would have seen below you flooded valleys flattened fields and ruined crops and in places the food distribution system simply broke down merchants from as far away as yorkshire were travelling through the home counties desperately trying to buy up the last precious supplies of grain
sorowe spradde over all ure londe an thusent winter there bifore com nevere non so strong to binde all the mene men in mourning and in care and ure catel died al togedir and maden the lond al bare so faste com never wrecche into engelond that made men more agaste
swathes of central england are under water tonight in the last few minutes it's been confirmed that one hundred fifty thousand homes in gloucestershire are now without
what would it be like for a farmer in the fourteenth century you've got two years of total destruction of the crops and everything i mean can you put yourself in their position
well almost certainly we'd be tenant farmers certainly wouldn't own the farm rents would have to be paid so it's a desperate situation of finding enough money to pay the rent otherwise landlord comes along and says you're out so that's the first thing then of course feeding the family and keeping the farm running and trying to get the next crop in any cattle he'd have to be forced to sell because he couldn't feed if you're forced to sell you always get a lower price so he'd suffer that way he couldn't recoup the money by selling and once the cattle are sold he can't produce milk that really sounds absolutely appalling
the landlords' repossessions from christina's neighbours are entered in the codicote court book up from an average of half a dozen to thirty eight surrendered tenancies in one thousand three hundred sixteen the great famine was accompanied by a virulent pestilence of cattle and by a human epidemic maybe typhoid about ten per cent of the population died over half a million people among the dead was christina's brother john and her husband william also disappears probably dead in the epidemic of one thousand three hundred nineteen so christina is left with her mother agnes and two small children john and alice in her little house with its precious garden
starvation was always a possibility and you would grow whatever you possibly could this is where your edible weeds came in if your crops failed at least you'd have something to put in the pottage things like fat hen and borage and bitter cress even things like bristly ox tongue which is like eating cardboard you boil it and it goes into a horrible green wad but at least it fills the belly
always been the way in medieval times you had to pay a tithe which was often a tenth part of the grain the miller was always fairly prosperous i think in the village
we just loved this village we loved the people in here and the nice quiet countryside life
i thought i'd got to know christina by now she'd survived famine pestilence and civil war and brought up two children she did well but then a last clue in the parchment trail we're up to one thousand three hundred forty five now the wednesday after saint mark the evangelist and here's the surprise william stacy now dead held from the landlord a messuage with a courtyard and a garden and christina cok who was his wife now claims that they had joint tenure here one thousand three hundred forty five she's now in her sixties a man who was her husband william stacy has died and christina claims to the landlord that she has the rights to their jointly held property so christina had married for a second time the day appointed for the case was the saturday before trinity sunday late may and on that day christina the villein of codicote came here to saint albans to meet the abbot's authorities and she called for the court books to be brought forward to prove her case and she showed that the record was indeed as she said it was could she read we don't know but she could certainly understand she won the case maybe time had moved on in the fifty five years since alice le bounde stood here and lost her case because the man is the head of the woman but maybe christina was a feistier woman anachronistic well here's the reality of a medieval woman's life this woman's bones came from a village cemetery and she was sixty just like christina
particularly in the femur neck and we do know that this individual did suffer form typical osteoporotic fractures one of her vertebra here shows it very clearly this is a normal vertebra that's the weight bearing part of the bone and this one from the central part of her spine you can see you've got severe crushing of the bone that's typical of a bone weakened by osteoporosis and she's lost all her teeth before death and she's lost them a long time before death as well you can see how resolved and thin that mandible is what we find in the lower end of the leg bones is in the female skeleton it's quite common to find a little squatting facet what i'm talking about is crescent shaped extension to the joint surface there the reason for that is when the person squats down and the foot bends up like that it causes that joint surface just to extend forwards this kind of thing is much more common in female skeletons than it is in males'
in the name of god amen i mak myn wylle in this wyse first i comytte my sawle to god and me body to be beryed in the chirchyerde of seynte giles and i beqwethe unto the lyghtes of the chirche fower busshellis of barley and i beqwethe unto alyce whyte my coate and for the remnaunt of my goodis i will that my childyr dispose it in comfort of my sawle
we think this is one of the tricks that a pestis uses so it streamlines its genome and it makes it a stealthy organism to avoid the human immune system then these black lines here added d. n. a. from other organisms and this contributes to the organism's virulence so it can build up the numbers very quickly so it'll just carry on multiplying within the blood and the lymph system until the immune system breaks down
was there anything they could do about it a fourteenth century doctor i mean
there's nothing they could do about it you just hoped that you survived some people survived and had the immunity but most died
everyone has their own responsibility to the group
we live together because we love each other
in nineteen sixty eight these two severly autistic children had pioneering therapy to help them speak
what do you want i want apple
this politician wasn't taking any prisoners in nineteen eighty five
you either be killed by them or kill them i want to see them dead
and in nineteen seventy eight fifteen people spent an entire year living in the iron age
breakfast was almost always a porridge of boiled wheat with milk and honey if there was any
now a new series catches up with the characters from some of the best b. b. c. documentaries of the last forty years and finds out what happened next plan's good
mo i'm in
boys are briefed
and hasn't he got a safe about as subtle as a flying brick wah ah ah
do the job we've got a bit of a hitch
are you sure what were you thinking
but he thought george had done it and that's the point isn't it this programme contains some violent scenes
dad
i've got to go a call just came in about a body spencer will deal with it right yeah i've got to go
hi there hi thank you
maintenance guys found it while surveying the air con system for an upgrade it was wedged in the duct and the survey work dislodged it
i'll have a look do you think we should take it on shall i ring boyd
i want this whole area sealed off nothing goes in or out d'you understand yes sir sieg heil sieg heil sieg heil sieg heil sieg heil sieg heil sieg heil sieg heil sieg heil sieg heil
luke luke
hi i'm doctor mckenna hi you're luke's dad i am yeah sit down thanks
how is he he's sleeping so what happens now
if he doesn't get the help he needs the odds aren't good
is there a programme he can go on
of course but i think luke's drug addiction is symptomatic of deeper problems there's evidence of self harm he's an at risk patient and i'm not sure that he's in a position to help himself so who helps him when luke wakes up he may well want to leave here i would like to keep him in
and you need my permission
i know it's a hard decision to make do you have a pen of course so what have we got right
so what have we got right thanks
that's why nobody noticed the smell cos there were cars parked just next to it
there would be a smell initially with the decomposition fluids but given the constant air flow the odours would've been dispersed now over here we have the fracture pattern for the legs this indicates to me that he was dropped down the shaft
so you're assuming he was dead before he hit the bottom
it's difficult to say he sustained great trauma to various parts of his body including these bilateral serial rib fractures here and contusions to various parts of the body and abrasions to the ulnar aspects of the arm
you're suggesting that these wounds weren't a result of the fall that he was beaten before he was put down the shaft right and the inevitable question eve time of death
mummification actually makes it very difficult to be specific but i'd put out between fifteen to twenty years ago
he looks like a proper skinhead violent culture violent death it goes with the territory
mm i also wanted to show you all this you can just see the imprint of a key of a key here exactly a key which i have over here the serial number had worn off but anything stamped into a metal permanently alters the crystalline structure
so you can give me the number i can give you the number i've done it
it's from the firm who makes the locks for the borough council housing and my piece de resistance is i've got the actual address
vote martin armstrong vote democratic nationalist your vote will not be wasted in this by election this is your chance for change i stand for homes and jobs in britain i stand for fairness above all i stand for justice for british people

i'm just going through this file on george andrews and it would seem that in january nineteen ninety one the police had an anonymous tip off stating that george had been murdered the original investigation couldn't find a body
so the person who made the tip off was too scared to reveal where the body was maybe
or it's possible they didn't actually know
poor woman so many assaults seventeen
all made by the same man jim brown
the last one was new year's eve nineteen ninety
yeah she nearly lost her baby and they separated shortly after that

he's dead
and er you think i did it he was living with you
and when you hospitalised your pregnant partner he vanished
she told you that no she didn't say anything all right
now how long had you known george before he went missing
about six months you know if you're looking for who killed george talk to the terrorists across the road
rashid said come on let's go go he put a death threat on george why did he do that he thought george had torched his house with his missus and kid inside
and had he nah
rashid's missus probably left the balti pot on too long but he thought george had done it and that's the point isn't it motive motive that's what we're looking for all the time motive
any other tips for me vote for the party that'll get tough on crime
and give you the resources to do your job properly
yeah yeah when george went missing how do you know when he went missing i ask the questions
very simple process i ask you reply
look i'm not the guy you want
no of course you're not because you told me that i should be after rashid said
look at it this way george goes missing two days after the mujahideen across the road there put out a fatwa on him so are you going to go over there pull him out of his shop course you're not because you'd have half of london outside your nick waving sticks screaming for allah george was a war hero casualty of war you know the war i'm talking about
yeah nice one son nice one
where did he come from
his brief's outside
so did your dad hit you no he hit your mum no sorry just have to tick the boxes
you're crap at your job you know that don't tell anyone
so er just out of curiosity what is it i mean he must've done something to you
no
i hate you i hate you
no wonder you hate him i don't hate him
how long have you been a shrink
a few months
you're really bad at it
i know i'll probably get fired soon unless you help me help you stay in for a few days make me look good
boyd boyd
yeah this marie waters so called close friend of george's
you didn't get very much from her did you i've not even got his birth date here
i didn't ask her about his birthday you don't know when mine is do you actually yes i do i don't get anything i'd put a key in her door what do you expect she did pretty well considering
well she just knew the exact date he left
new year's eve is not difficult to remember
no my point is that she told you and i think that's significant
what do you want to do about it bring her in why don't you bring her in i will good thanks come in i'm sorry to keep you
detective superintendent boyd it is ironic we meet under these circumstances i have you on a list as a potential policy advisor
you call those things policies
from what i read you've a reputation for taking the law into your own hands
it is in my hands mr. armstrong
exactly my party has a policy of giving power back to the police we're natural allies i want you back on the beat after real criminals
and i asked her to do it
sign here
sign for what to give your consent why don't you give me a kiss and then i'll sign
fine don't sign
is that it eh come on darlin' right here you got some jew blood in you somewhere come on bitch stella come on come on
hey you might want to wash that off i've got aids
he probably doesn't even have it he was just trying to freak you out
i've got no way of knowing
it's so unlikely especially with the aids virus how long before i know it's a standard procedure you go to the hospital do a blood test
is there any broken skin no no what the hell did you think you were doing i'm sorry he started to sorry doesn't do it what you did was completely unacceptable
hey hey hey come here it's going to be all right turn please
my client doesn't look too good he assaulted a female officer i take it it was recorded on camera yes it was good i look forward to seeing how much reasonable force was used
she acted in self defence i hope she's worth putting your job on the line i'm releasing him from custody but he goes nowhere understand
just come to our meetings show mr. armstrong out give me a fair hearing i'll bring him with me of course i am a pro police candidate it's all right i'll find my own way out
piece of shit he's just doing his job
he's right the country is going to the dogs what are you talking about what
and why are we even discussing this man
does skin colour dictate your vote
i found this down his throat
this photograph pieces of this photograph yeah
why a black guy down a skinhead's throat
very good question somebody shoved it down his throat or what
cracks to the hyoid bone suggest that some force was used to push the pieces of the photo down his throat these cracks coupled with the ligature marks on his neck lead me to believe that the actual cause of death was ligature strangulation
was the photograph before or after strangulation i don't know
the photograph the strangulation his other injuries reek of punishment ritual
you're joking right
i'm just sick of all this you know him my mum now all this crap with the election
i mean run away you and me
what do you mean it's got nothing to do with us yeah you maybe
so what the hell happened
they pulled me in i had no choice
i heard all the gory details from peter and terry you didn't do yourself any favours came to nothing what's the problem i'll tell you half the street see you getting arrested if the press run this before we know it we'll lose floating voters
well we'll just to get the floating voters back won't we
don't go making decisions on your own decisions that affect all of us get made by all of us are we clear
i know good oh by the way martin i liked all your new stuff about poles and romanians yeah yeah never did like romanians nothing but gypsies and vampires
i only wish you were going to be around to see how all this pans out
yeah well i'm a dying breed aren't i martin been a dying breed for some time now
could you tell me do you recognise that man at all we think he may have some connection with george's murder
i wonder could we talk a little about george i know it's upsetting but we need to get to know him
george was different
in what way
it's just something about him he listened to me and you liked him
i'm sorry to ask this but i must were you and george intimate
no no
dad mum's not in you can't tell me what to do
ah i'm i'm confused mr. said
about what well george andrews tries to burn down your house and you don't put the police onto it what would be the point in that his word against mine we both know where that would go
we do you're speaking for me now
i don't know if he actually did it but he was there on the street i saw him running away
i didn't find him what would you have done if you had i wouldn't have killed him maybe you didn't mean to kill him you don't seriously think i did it do you
you've got a bit of a history with this george man haven't you mr. said
that it was nothing nothing tell me then about this nothing the first time i saw him he attacked me get off him leave him leave him get off him leave him
that's not the way i heard it at all
i was trying to stop them then brown and his cronies got involved jim brown yes after that you never saw one without the other
come here yeah see that eh white white nice one son nice one
mr. boyd these men are not just a group of thugs no what are they then they're thugs with a cause and surely that must tell you all you need to know
you're a man with a cause so i know all about you i found this in your shop
seems you've got quite a thing going on
yeah it's a pretty heavy thing this british jihad
this is a warning it's not a threat
if we continue in this social climate radicalism is inevitable
so you bomb the living crap out of us is that the idea
am i a serious suspect in this man's death
can you account for your movements new year's eve nineteen ninety can you no therefore yes you are a suspect
thank you thanks a lot george had a tattoo and it was very similar to jim's do you know what that might signify
oh george's design was different to jim's though
george didn't have all the flames i don't know why
and did it signify anything was it important to the group this tattoo
no it was just a stupid lads' thing a night out i don't know
the night that george disappeared what can you remember about that
well it was new year's eve and we were having a party
what time did george leave
i i left early sorry
you must have missed him it's hard isn't it when you lose someone you've made a connection with it seems so unfair
look i don't know much about george
marie the slightest thing could help us find his killer
what is it you're so scared of
nothing hello hi hi stella
i haven't been able to find anything on george david andrews yet it's really weird no tax no address no glimpse of a record he's like the invisible man
well keep trying will you are you o. k. now
what do you remember the saint jerome's hospice fire what are you talking about the case
help me help me
so that is charles ayaniki
yeah i've got that born in nigeria
and here we have a raymond ayaniki relation brother saint saviour's church
hello raymond ayaniki
one moment please
can we have a word please
one moment yes di jordan aha detective superintendent boyd
how are you father ayaniki well
how d'you do your brother was charles ayaniki
ayanik ay ayanik ay
my apologies please thanks
so you have reopened the saint jerome's case
no we're investigating the disappearance of a man who went missing december nineteen ninety his name was george andrews was yes he was murdered sixteen years ago
you don't recognise him no
why do you think i can be of help
this is a reconstruction of a photograph found on his person
would you say that that looked yes of course it looks like my brother
it could be charlie how do you do a reconstruction like this we're not here to discuss reconstruction technology
this suggests there was a connection between your brother charlie and this man george andrews yeah he was your younger brother yes and he went into the hospice when november nineteen eighty nine eighty nine
people make all kinds of assumptions say all kinds of terrible things when a man has aids
what you mean he wasn't gay
charlie was such a good person
you don't have to be a bad person to be gay no of course
it is not the sinner that we condemn but the sin charlie was an inspiration he worked for the united nations all over the world he must have caught h. i. v. when he was in africa
so in your opinion there was no connection between your brother charlie and this man george andrews
he was last seen new year's eve nineteen ninety
new year's eve mm the anniversary of my brother's death
help me
this is his grave i must admit when you told me that you were a police officer i thought my prayers were being answered and that you'd come here about saint jerome's no one has ever been charged with it have you ever looked into it have you i don't understand the photograph of your brother
we didn't just find it on george andrews' person someone someone had rammed it down his throat
we need a d. n. a. sample from you of course
hello marie i hope i can be assured of your vote haven't seen you around much these last few days
you know how it is
i thought at least you would've visited me at campaign headquarters
wouldn't want to get in the way oh come on there's always time for old friends
you me and jim the things we used to get up to yeah well the past is the past you been bothered by that policeman at all no he just wants to know about george let's hope they get the bastard who did it eh this makes me feel my age seems only yesterday she was playing all right still i suppose you never stop worrying about them do you no matter how old they are
a present from the churchyard thanks pleasure
charles ay anike ayan ike ayanike ayanike charles ayanike only has one public offence disturbance of the peace he was arrested back in eighty nine at a gay pride march for chaining himself i know who george was
his name was sam cohen
sam cohen sam cohen
that's what i was going to tell you he was arrested alongside charles ayanike sam cohen is george andrews
so this is a jewish gay guy sam cohen who ends up as a neo nazi skinhead george andrews
it's quite a profound personality change isn't it i would say yes
so when did sam become george
the first time we're aware of him being george andrews was in the summer of nineteen ninety when he was living with marie and jim brown he was known to them as george andrews six months after the fire
so do you think he flipped out after his friend's death
it was a big flip
grief can bring on an identity crisis but aren't we missing a trick here i mean
he sought out the people accused of killing charlie
exactly it smacks of revenge the thing is that he didn't take any revenge on these people they're all fine the only one who's dead is him
beautiful beautiful there you go there you go
is that warm sure is
so what was he hoping to achieve
to change your identity can actually result in a profound sense of disorientation you cut yourself adrift you're lost the majority of us really need to belong so maybe he just couldn't hack it he lost his identity and he adopted theirs
sieg heil sieg heil sieg heil
hello again why did you lie to us then
i didn't like sam i didn't like him or trust him i preferred to forget about it but they were lovers they could have been married no they could not have been not in the eyes of god
on your religious trip again well that's understandable
do you consider that something to sneer at mr. boyd i was there every day with my brother watching him die praying for him every day but charlie did not repent for his sin he did not repent so he's burning in hell now is he he would have let me save his soul he would have repented but sam was there whispering in his ear
did you see sam after charlie died
i did not kill him i didn't ask if you killed him i asked you if you saw sam after charlie died
you both loved the same man did you contact him did he try and contact you it's pathetic you just hide behind all this i mean it's just an excuse all of it you don't see love when it's right in front of you self righteous bloody bigot
he's an authority figure oh he is trapped between his family and his religion and you should be feeling sorry for him
i feel sorry for sam caught between his lover's brother who's a priest jim brown's lot take away the clothes and what's the difference
come on you can't believe that
it's fear that's what they do someone beat the crap out of sam
but he's a priest you can't suggest that he was capable of such violence
they invented it torture repression spanish inquisition
talking of torture and repression what about
what do you want me to do talk to her you do what you wanna do then
stella would you like to see boyd
it will never happen again i know will i lose my job
you're on this case aren't you yeah
definitely i am
come in
the tests came back on sam's jeans there were traces of almond oil on the knees
so that gives us a murder site what does it tell us that our murderer is a careless baker or what possibly
how did it go
everything we hold dear today everything we want for our children depends on us winning this election all our hopes and dreams hang in the balance i love my country and i'm not ashamed to say it we are a great people with a proud history and the legacy i want to leave for my children is a britain that can be great once more this is your chance for change i stand for homes and jobs in britain i stand for fairness and justice
hassan have you seen selim he's not answering his phone keep your dirty hands off him
some want you to believe that i'm a racist as if a vote for me is a vote for intolerance and hate as if there'll be race riots and ethnic cleansing
armstrong's doing his rent a quote again
nothing could be further from the truth we are a party for the british people for every british person a vote for me is a vote for britain this is not about race it's the most unbelievable crap
you can't dismiss him he's struck a chord with people
britain has a problem with immigration with vast amounts of cheap foreign labour it's the poles and romanians who are responsible we are not a racist party but i stand for communities free of gun crime and crack dens and slum housing and the main reason
sir
my name is selim said a proud muslim youth for too long we have been asleep but now we are awake it's time for the british jihad to begin
he is my son don't you understand it doesn't make any difference what he's done
making that kid do a martyr video was a big mistake
grace thinks there's a word in the flames
if you go in there and face him he won't lay a hand on you ever again
did you get it did you get it what's she doing here
there was no one there
a perfect irony isn't it they burn down an aids hospice and all end up getting it
just talk to us
if i tell the world i'll never say enough cos it was not said to you and that's exactly what i need to do if i end up with you
talk

oh well doctor sian gave me a hard on in her office just before so that's a good thing she's standing behind me isn't she oh thank god for that
no she's over there
take a working farm sixteen children and a week off school the catch is they have to do a crash course in writing poetry they'll be in groups of four today's team is aziza sunesh fran and corey let's meet them as they settle in without t. v. or teachers instead there are farm animals their own personal poet poems on screen to encourage them and a visit from a famous poet here's today's team
hi i'm aziza and i come from london i like playing football i like doing gymnastics and i absolutely hate watching cricket
hello i'm frandella i'm from manchester in the caribbean i moved to england when i was a baby i like doing football running around games and clapping games
hi i'm corey and i'm from manchester i like art and science and music and i like exploring
hi my name's sunesh and i'm from birmingham i drum on everything i touch in class i sometimes get told off but i just can't really help myself day one at the big slam academy in five days they have to perform a poem for the other children but what will they have to write about all will be revealed
welcome to the big slam academy your challenge is to write a poem which is based on something personal and has either happened to you in the past or experienced this week it should be written in free verse your aim is to produce a polished piece of poetry to perform at the end of the week on hand to help you is paul lyalls your poet in residence waiting for you in the writing room
welcome welcome welcome and welcome i am here today to work with you on memories and experience
but what sort of experiences are actually worth considering paul offers some helpful hints
think of things that happened on holiday or when you have been away little things and i want you to try to write them down it might not be a really amazing thing just a small thing a bit of a misunderstanding little things that happen to people make really good little poems
with so many memories to choose from what are they thinking about
i don't know really what to write but i'll get through it eventually
i have had dramatic stuff happen in my life so it is going to be cool
poem alert time for some memory inspiration
for ideas paul encourages the group to explore the house's memories they spend the rest of the day soaking up the atmosphere what fascinating things will they discover day two the group set off on their farm chores will the farm cultivate their creativity
before i never thought of doing a poem about animals and smells and fields and trees and stuff like that cos i live in the city when i write a poem i think it always has to be funny or happy sometimes i write sad ones most of the time though i write happy ones
i was thinking of writing a poem about different things in the house which are interesting
i am used to writing so doing a poem in free verse would be a bit hard but i could get used to it
back at the house corey is homesick he's thinking back to happy family holidays aziza loves the countryside but keeps changing her mind about what to write
i was going to write about breaking my arm when i was two but then i thought i'd use recent memories because they're clearer
what i find difficult is finding the memories and like the words cos sometimes i write the poem and i don't really think it's good so i lose a bit of confidence
you don't have to write about your own experiences imagine a memory for something else
i'm matthew sweeney this is my fishbones dreaming fishbones lay in the smelly bin he was a head a backbone and a tail soon the cats would be in for him he didn't like to be this way he shut his eyes and dreamed back back to when he was fat and hot on a plate beside green beans with lemon juice squeezed on him and a man with a knife and fork raised about to eat him he didn't like to be this way he shut his eyes and dreamed back back to when he was frozen in the freezer with lamb cutlets and minced beef and prawns three months he was in there he didn't like to be this way he shut his eyes and dreamed back back to when he was squirming in a net with thousands of other fish on the deck of a boat and the rain falling wasn't wet enough to breathe in he didn't like to be this way he shut his eyes and dreamed back back to when he was darting through the sea past crabs and jellyfish and others like himself or surfacing to jump for flies and feel the sun on his face he liked to be this way he dreamed hard to try and stay there
the poet's written it in the third person and that's what gives it that kind of like unusual erm personal sort of technique
i like the way that he set it out as in he has done it in stages of his life
you can be the fish and shut your eyes and dream back
the group's found a souvenir elephant and they're creating a memory for it
what do you think that elephant might be a souvenir a souvenir from down the road no
from another country yeah
how might that elephant feel now after fifty years of being here
it might feel a bit sad cos you're away from your friends and family
and how do you think this teapot feels know what it reminds me of you know you get your fashion models yeah and fashion models are really like this a little bit
if you look at it it looks quite proud with all its embroidery
paul sets them the task of writing a group poem about the elephant and the teapot
brilliant right let's hit the door and go
day three the morning brings the results of the group's efforts poet michael rosen arrives to entertain our promising poets
do you always write long poems
no sometimes i write very very short ones one goes down behind the dustbin i met a dog called jim he didn't know me and i didn't know him doesn't get shorter than that that is very poem like with rhymes and rhythm but there are other kinds of poems that are what's called a monologue or performance piece
how do you choose memories to write about
do you write your poems with your readers in mind
yes i think i do sometimes i write with a live audience in mind sometimes what i write i think oh i'll be able to do that in a performance and maybe the children could join in
thanks very much thank you thank you
day four it's the final day of writing and the children have to concentrate and get the best out of their poems
she dreams of being a real girl is there any other words for real
actual factual true natural pure
corey is finding the right words for his poem
on holiday in spain me and my brother was playing in the hotel garden
me and my brother was playing in the hotel grounds garden is fancy but i mean the hotel doesn't really have a garden does it
i had reached my target yes a target is the bull's eye yeah
paul gives them some last minute advice before they perform their poetry
the first one is about making strong contact with your audience you're performing to the person who is the farthest away from you and you're looking at them and you're projecting and you're calling out to them
they play a game which helps them to maintain good eye contact and use a strong voice it should make them less tense about tomorrow's impending performance
well done guys
performance day and intrepid aziza is in first
next is sunesh with his unusually titled extermination of the savoury
i liked the way he described the wheaty waxy weetabix
corey is fighting his nerves and determined to perform his poem scant water
it's a good piece of description and good use of words
and finally a now confident frandella with her girl made of straw
she's made of straw not much more reading a book all about country life her thoughts are floating into thin air does anyone see them she doesn't care she dreams of being an actual factual natural girl so she can cartwheel and dance but she hasn't a chance she's made of straw not much more but she can still dream

the splendour of the british landscape has inspired our greatest painters writers and composers i'm on a journey to discover these places and find out they were excited by them i'm travelling to the east of england to suffolk the birthplace of john constable one of england's best loved painters to the soft turf of newmarket home of british racing to the norfolk broads with its barges and windmills and to the wilder shores of the north sea east anglia is a land of distant horizons immense skies the birthplace of some of the most idyllic and comforting british landscape paintings and yet it's a place of mystery haunted isolated in its swirling mists a corner of england unlike any other the flatlands my journey begins in the stour valley in suffolk this is where the painter john constable grew up his paintings of an england that's largely vanished still entrance us make us imagine going back in time this is dedham vale part of the stour that constable knew and loved best and made famous by his painting he came back here once in his later years and was travelling by stagecoach and turned to two strangers in the coach and said isn't this beautiful countryside and quick as a flash one of them replied this sir is constable country i think constable must have been very pleased constable grew up working in the prosperous mill his family owned at flatford his father wanted him to take over the business but constable was determined to become a painter after going to art school in london he came home to the country he'd been brought up in i paint my own places best constable once said the sound of water escaping from mill dams willows old rotten banks slimy posts brickwork this place made me a painter and his biggest landscapes have all been done within a mile of here but this of course is the most famous of all the setting for the hay wain constable's most famous painting shows the view he saw every day as a boy at the water's edge is the cottage of willie lot the old neighbour who lived all his life by the mill pond it's a sparkling summer's day and all's well with the world it's interesting to stand here and look at the scene as it is today and there's scarcely any difference of course the cart isn't in the water and the dog isn't there be nice if they were actually but willie lot's house on the corner is exactly as constable painted it the interesting thing is you stand here and you cannot help but look at this through constable's eyes it's a good demonstration of how powerfully artists can influence the way we look at something i mean i dare say that if constable hadn't painted this picture of the hay wain people would walk past this place and wouldn't give it a second glance but because of this picture they come here in their thousands and stand and look and see it through his eyes today the trees and shrubs are painstakingly pruned to recreate the look of constable's picture hello there what's the plan what are you doing here
um opening up the view for the picture of the hay wain
did you study the painting before you started
i've lived here all my life and we've got a picture of it at home
were you brought up with it on the living room wall yes does it give you a strange feeling to be remaking a painting
i think it makes me feel lucky to live here and to be able to do stuff somewhere where you can actually say you know the hay wain we worked there
it is an english thing it's the greenery it's the trees it's the water it's the old seventeenth century buildings
do you think we see it as constable saw it
if he came back and was to look over i'm sure he'd go yeah that's pretty much as i remembered it i don't think he'd be
constable's paintings captured the day to day scenes along the river stour his attachment to this place lasted all his life it was here that he first fell in love with a local girl called maria bicknell he wooed her along these river banks and despite the opposition of her family he finally married her when his father died constable painted a picture of the family mill he had decided against taking it over and instead left flatford to live in london painting is but another word for feeling constable once said and this was his emotional farewell to his father and his childhood home when i started in television i worked in this part of the world so i got to know the flatlands quite well and became very fond of them i had an open car and it was summer and i used to drive around with music playing and thinking oh this is heaven it's very special and it's particularly so because it's so cut off you know that the roads don't go anywhere they go to the sea and that's it the people here always complain about the communications but secretly i think they quite like the idea that they're just that bit removed a few miles upstream from constable country is the market town of sudbury birthplace of another great english painter thomas gainsborough at heart gainsborough was a landscape painter but he made his name painting the aristocrats and the celebrities of the day gainsborough didn't sell many landscape paintings in his lifetime it was the portraits of the rich and the famous that made the painter's reputation and his fortune in fact when you think of gainsborough you think of those proud men in their tights and their beautiful jackets the women in gorgeous silks falling to the ground but gainsborough was always captivated by scenery he once said portraiture is my profession landscape is my pleasure this picture combines gainsborough's profession and his pleasure it was painted to celebrate the marriage of robert andrews and frances carter but it's as much a celebration of the landscape as of two people newly married the golden fields the majestic oak trees and the skies of suffolk and here two hundred fifty years later is the very oak tree at the centre of gainsborough's most famous picture here on the auberies estate mr. andrews stood here with his gun under his arm his wife in her beautiful dress sitting on a bench just there and their estate stretching out rolling away into the distance behind them just over the hill sits cornard wood or gainsborough's forest as it's sometimes called there's not that much of a forest left these days but these are the very woods where gainsborough developed his passion for landscape painting and it's said that he used to forge notes from his father to the school excusing him from school so that he could spend the entire day truanting up here drawing in this lovely landscape you can trace the curve of today's road in the track through the woods in one of gainsborough's finest pictures it's a scene of country people using their land man and nature in harmony in a clearing in the forest a woodcutter bundles sticks a labourer rests on his shovel under the admiring glance of a milkmaid two travellers one with his dog one on horseback head for the distant village of great henny and all framed by the canopy of gainsborough's forest travelling north from the woods and streams of the stour valley we reach newmarket home to the sport of kings good morning it was here that one man became the unchallenged master of the art of painting the horse george stubbs stubbs came to newmarket to paint the finest racehorses of the day is this rubbing down
yes i'm going to give him a bit of a wash here cos they sweat bad here
stubbs's pictures all had horses being rubbed down with straw do you do that still
um like a wisp yes yeah now and then you get them sun dried you know old fashioned things
old fashioned to use straw is it
yeah
stubbs lovingly captures every contour and muscle of the body part of the excitement of his pictures comes from his understanding what makes a powerful horse so go on i can see an animal with four legs and a head tell me what's needed to make a good racehorse
a good sign is like a big apple bottom that is where the engine is at the back
apple bottom you call it yeah
a racecourse is a wonderfully exciting place everybody cheering at the end of the race bets being laid the thunder of horses going past and yet stubbs paints his horses calm strong dignified majestic almost as though they're above it all stubbs was invited to newmarket by lord bolingbrooke to paint his racing superstar gimcrack it was july one thousand seven hundred sixty five and this was the most exciting race of the season a dual between gimcrack and sir james lowther's asham can i have twenty on clueless ten good afternoon to win clueless i wanted four to one and it's gone seven to two
too slow it just goes to show you see
you've gotta get up in the morning
there's twenty quid on four on number four to win
i reckon i reckon it's a good name because everybody thinks it won't work well but it's a lovely horse i placed twenty on clueless bolingbrooke had one thousand guineas riding on gimcrack one hundred thousand in today's money
they're off length and a half left and clueless black and yellow stripes on the sleeves she's up on the outside of welling she's just behind now clueless the yellow jacket white cap who makes very swift headway a length and a half away come on clueless but now has to be rousted along by kieren fallon
come on clueless
clueless on the outside is galloping on trying to get to the head but top gear wins from signatory ebtikaar clueless and kalamkar
we're going over
well it's terrific here we are on our backs in the middle of a field but it wasn't as bad as i thought though it was quite surprising and here we are with a worm's eye view of the fens instead of a bird's eye view the funny thing is that this is the only field in all directions that is rough to land on everywhere else is crops peter and stephen wortley are identical twins born within ten minutes of each other they've farmed here all their lives
i love the farming life you hear the birds tweeting which for me is as good as anything
on a day like today what better life can you have i can't think of a better way of earning a living
and do you think it's beautiful countryside to look at
yes we do the scenery here is nice if you get some land on hills you can see a long way you call those hills
the high spots we call 'em
they're about six inches high
our father he's been here all his life he's now ninety five never slept away from the place and never had a holiday
never slept away from home
never slept away from home in ninety five years
how did he find a wife
my mother was in the wrens and my aunt was in the wrens he met my mother in the house i'm sure he'd never have married otherwise he met her in the house he lives in
and what was their job
they carried anything that needed moving on the rivers building material farming corn and barley just about anything you wanted
so you have a crew of about half a dozen today what would they have had either on their own on their own
or more possibly two of them a skipper and his boy my uncle billy sailed his forty tonner like this on his own
as he trained as a classical artist he believed that all landscape was a classical painting he actually planted a dead tree just to create the right atmosphere
and he brought the hill down here yep that's right he flattened the top of the hill
and then graded the slopes down
how well suited is this part of norfolk to that kind of reconstructing of the landscape
brilliant because it people say norfolk is flat it's not it's not very high ground but it's very undulating and i think he actually built the park to reflect the county
the closer you get to the coast the more vulnerable the land becomes sluices dykes and sea walls conspire to keep the north sea at bay this watery landscape has been invoked in many a mystery tale it was the setting for a famous nineteen thirties detective story the nine tailors by dorothy l. sayers sayers pictured this place as perfect to get away with murder evidence can be washed away by the tides bodies slide silently into swamps even the sound of church bells across the marshes takes on a menacing note sayers' father was rector in a local parish the bell tower in the village church of terrington saint clement was the stage for one of her most disturbing scenes ah it's new year's eve and a thief and murderer called geoffrey deacon has been tied up and imprisoned here in the belfry unknown to his captor the villagers have decided that they'll bring in the new year by celebrating with a nine hour peal of these bells in dorothy sayers' words it was like an assault of devils grinding bludgeoning randan crazy intolerable torment and when it's over deacon is found dead he's been unable to endure the torture of the bells is it heavy can i have a go
you can try and catch that with me
right pull it down you've got lost now
it's all right
are you all right you seem to be in danger of going up with it
a little bit behind that time
is that my fault
no it's all right
i could do this all day yeah dorothy sayers had a nine hour peal rung in this tower what's the longest you've ever rung a peal nearly three hours three hours could you do nine hours
i don't think so no why i'm a bit too advanced in years
would the noise be loud enough to kill somebody if they were up there
no it'd be very uncomfortable though very uncomfortable but i don't think it would kill them
i've come almost full circle crossing back into suffolk with its long beaches and fishing villages the composer benjamin britten grew up on this coast he lived in aldeburgh for the last thirty years of his life he once said he'd tried to live elsewhere but this coastline was like a magnet always dragging him back finely tuned for the natural sounds of the sea the waves the wind the gulls in his opera peter grimes there's an interlude called dawn in which he actually captures the sound of the sea sucking at the shingle peter grimes is the tragic story of a fisherman whose young apprentice dies in mysterious circumstances grimes' solitary behaviour arouses suspicions among the villagers and they wrongly accuse him of murder everywhere he goes he hears the whispers of local gossips he calls them those voices that will not be drowned an outcast from the community peter grimes finds his only consolation at sea do you see the sea as a friend or as an enemy
it's friendly today but it's not always this friendly it can be quite nasty
do you know its habits
yeah you can through the years you can sense what's gonna happen even if the forecast is fine you can feel that it don't look quite right that's time to up anchor and get home as quickly as possible
are fishermen superstitious yeah very much so
not wearing anything green in the boat or having anything green coloured in it you mustn't mention animals on board anything to do with animals
you can't talk about your dog or cat no
you shouldn't have said that ooh sorry that's just an ongoing thing that's been going on for years and years if something goes wrong between here and the beach we'll blame you for the what you just said sorry
peter grimes
at the end of the opera peter grimes hounded by the villagers is in despair he's urged to go to sea sink his boat and drown himself the desperate words of peter grimes are captured in this sculpture on the beach at aldeburgh it's a memorial to benjamin britten the sculpture's the work of the artist maggi hambling
the idea is you see this rather strange object rising up out of the shingle when you come round to this side i hope there's a sort of explosion to the piece that is what happened inside me the first time i heard his music
as i saw it coming along the seashore and there it looks immediately like a great seashell that's been swept up the beach
jolly good very good very good
the north sea has also inspired many of hambling's paintings you didn't always paint the sea did you what started you off
you feel you own it
well i don't know that one owns a lover but it's that kind of relationship
so you're jealous close it looks like a drab stretch of shingle and a cold grey north sea well it does today so what is it about it that makes it special well it's full of infinite variety
if you're attached to this piece of sea it's unlike any other people say it's all grey but actually it's incredibly full of colour
the whole coastline along this stretch of norfolk and suffolk is constantly eroded by the aggressive sea a few miles from aldeburgh you can't help but be reminded how the flatlands are in its power during the middle ages this was the site of dunwich one of the largest ports in england but over a period of three hundred years the town was swallowed up by the sea the drama of dunwich being devoured by the waves was an irresistible challenge to that master of british sea painting william turner by the time turner was painting dunwich had vanished he shows the remains of a pale and ghostly town perched above a turbulent sea it's eerie to think that under this grey water lies an old english town streets and houses and churches and shops they do say that at certain states of the tide or the wind you can still hear the sounds of the church bells ringing under the water well maybe maybe not in one thousand eight hundred twenty nine the east coast inspired john constable after he had suffered a terrible loss maria bicknell the wife he adored had died of consumption at the age of only forty one in his misery he painted hadleigh castle after maria's death constable said never again shall i feel as i have felt the world is totally changed to me the man who once said that painting was just another word for feeling had found here the perfect place to express his own sense of desolation and loss the bleak east coast is far removed from the safe and comforting world of constable country in painting it constable proved himself again a master of using the countryside to explore the landscape of his own soul just as he had in happier times when he painted those pictures which still lift our spirits today
join david dimbleby next when he'll be exploring the highlands and glens of scotland and ireland from the bonnie banks of loch lomond to glencoe and across the sea to sligo and the glens of antrim if it makes any difference it's since bec got back
nobody saw us as far as you know
this is the guy who cheated on you with his wife
you're asking for trouble we want our dad back
we have to make him see what she's really like
did you forget he's the younger brother of one of your best mates
this is serious paul you're one of my students
well we enjoy going for walks now but look at it look at the traffic you can hardly cross the road and who wants to walk here doesn't encourage you does it no it doesn't no no not at all what we really dream of is walking in the countryside in a lovely environment the birds twittering lovely wildlife and flowers far away from all this hectic traffic
at the end of the day roger and a. n. n. like nothing better than luxuriating in their hot tub but what they're really after is an upgrade
we really love this don't we yes we do the thing is though it isn't really quite big enough we would love a swimming pool because we do go swimming on average about twice a week and we'd swim much more if we had our own pool so that's why we'd like a house with some land so that we could build one cheers cheers
the winters bought their spacious bungalow for four hundred five thousand more than two years ago just after the property market had peaked but has it increased in value since then i've invited two estate agents in to find out roger and ann's house was built as part of the world homes exhibition in nineteen eighty two made from canadian timber it's a very unique home through the front door you turn left into a large living room left again you'll find an ample bathroom and moving down the small corridor leads into the master bedroom
this is a great property very near to the city centre we'll have no problem selling this
back past the bathroom is a spacious and somewhat dated bar area and just off this the study beyond which is a double garage up the spiral staircase is a recording studio used by their music producer son mark he's now moving to london which is another reason for roger and ann's move to the country back through the living area is the dining room and just beyond this on the left is a very spacious kitchen
this property offers luxurious accommodation and will sell very quickly
past the kitchen is a good sized utility room and as if that's not enough there's another seven rooms still to come first up a small reading room the shower room is one of the three bathrooms and next to that a compact office space to the left is the second double bedroom further down the corridor is bedroom number three adjacent to this a luxury double steam shower room and finally a fourth bedroom making a grand total of sixteen rooms
the thing that i'm most interested in is how much money we've got to spend on your house in the country so roger what's the budget
maximum of about four hundred fifty i think
a little bit yeah so roger where would you like to move to
somewhere in the leicestershire area it's a lovely county
and it sometimes gets forgotten about but there is some beautiful countryside there
would you really not consider a period house
if it's been beautifully modernised inside then perhaps we might
that's quite nice isn't it look lovely lot of space outside
today i'll be shown around by the owner lynda newbury hello lynda hello catherine nice to see you the major selling point of your property is the land cos i believe you've got two acres is that right
yes that's right excellent well my family want to keep alpacas
so where could they put them can you explain where your land lies
it starts at that fence there and it goes along the hedge line all the way across there and down that hedge and down the embankments
so that fence line there and then round yes the other far side of this little shed yes excellent
there would be room outside there for a swimming pool i'm sure
i'm sure there would it's nice and flat
that's a boiler room and welly cupboard downstairs toilet
everything goes off in two directions which way is the living area that side shall we go this way first lynda goodness me this house is a real mixture of styles isn't it
oh yes it certainly is what look like old windows and this new bricks new bricks
this is a really spacious room so that's your kind of formal dining area
yes that's the dining room yes it's a nice size
very thick wall that oh yes there's two chimneys i see so you've got a fire on this side as well yes the original fireplace how lovely to have a fire in your kitchen
got a coal scuttle there
yes so you could always put in a living flame gas fire if you wanted
if there's gas there yeah
now this kitchen looks very new
it is yes we did it when we first moved in
did you put that lovely shiny range in
yes we put the range in as well right
you've got a sort of add on room
yes it's the utility room that was added on before we moved here
every kitchen should have one
it's also very good vantage points you see this side of the house and what i'd call your front lawn really yes it is well i'm eyeing it with a view to swimming pool potential right yeah it's one thing on my list which you haven't got
no but that actually is a fairly level piece of land isn't it yeah it's not too bad yeah
nice you've got plenty of space yeah there shouldn't be a problem getting planning permission wouldn't have thought so
so back across what lynda calls her chav carpet in the entrance hall and the edge of it demarcates the end of the living accommodation and the start of the bedrooms this is bedroom one and i think you'd definitely get a good sized double bed in here it's also a chance to see the ubiquitous panelling with a coat of paint on it
do you think it looks better with paint on it
not really no no i don't either
this property has a very linear layout all the rooms sort of follow on one after the next so you get this very long corridor effect the next room we come to is what's currently being used as the home office now in terms of a business i think this might be on the small side
i think it would wouldn't you you wouldn't get two desks in no or two computers
well it's certainly a very good size it's dominated by this corner jacuzzi bath no less not quite a hot tub
that's very nice i like that
so the new extension is like a kind of t. on the end of the house and after the bathroom we've got bedroom two which again is a very good size of course the great part about this end of the house is it's all new and modern so we've got fifteen year old double glazed windows they are wooden framed so they match the ones in the original part of the house but low maintenance which was one of roger and ann's concerns so this is the master bedroom but we have got an admittedly fairly tiny en suite shower room
that's right let's start with the older part
as we go through here we're going into the house that's on the roadside right so this is the older part of the house
that's quite nice
the rest of the old house runs along the roadside so it's through this way is it that's it this is the main sitting room is it
this is the sitting room right it is on the cosy side i'd say
doesn't look a very big lounge does it i don't think it does no
what's in that little door there my wife's got a little office oh where all the filing goes top marks for use of space robert that's amazing underneath is the wine rack so it's a real glory hole in there that's right
think it's better to make it into a wine cupboard than a study
so as we step through here we're now walking into nineteen ninety nine you're into the twentieth century it's amazing cos it just matches with the old part of the house well i hope so
very narrow it is a bit narrow but it looks very attractive
oh now this is a lovely room proper country kitchen yes i don't think ann's going to like that oh dear not desperately keen on them are there alternative means of cooking
over here is again a modern twin oven fan oven and electric hob brilliant
that looks more me yeah true
she will approve of the patio doors cos that's one of the things she really wanted i just noticed looking back there there's a utility room as well
that's right all the white goods tucked away
that's good yeah it is very good
a shingle drive directs you from the back of the house to several outbuildings and to the land now this little building believe it or not used to be the old pigsty but robert has basically transformed it it's now got electricity it's been lined it's another little room
yeah that might be quite good cos i could run the business from there and you could do the business with your alpacas and things from there
and there's more just beyond the pigsty is something far more modern if roger and a. n. n. think the pigsty might be a bit small as an office not to fear because there's another one which has been brought over from finland it's completely lined insulated there are electricity points so this actually would make a really good home office for them
also make a very nice garden house wouldn't it sort of summer house
it's just opposite the vegetable patch so when they get bored they can pop out and do a bit of gardening and at the top of the property is this very swanky run of buildings
that would be ideal wouldn't it yeah
and finally the all important paddock
plenty of space to put in the pool you can see that it should be great i'd love it
i'm back in the old part of the house there are four bedrooms two in the old part two in the new part now the first here is a pretty decent sized double
good size not bad no that's a very good size
it's got fitted cupboards and a sort of semi en suite just a loo and a sink in there there's a central bathroom here so this is the kind of family bathroom it's quite sweetly fitted it's got quite a dinky kind of look to it
it's big enough isn't it
and then this is a pretty good sized twin room
that's quite pretty isn't it perhaps we could start bed and breakfast as well
don't mind if they pay
without further ado i'm going to magic myself back over into the sparkling new extension so now up the stairs in the newer extension and everything undeniably looks a lot more spick and span at this end of the house so this is bedroom three it has its own en suite which has all been fairly recently fitted but this is a good sized double room and the bedrooms in the newer part are at the back so they're nice and quiet
it's all right for a guest room
yeah you can see a bit more room yes yes yes the way it looked
that's very nice you can imagine our big double bed there that's very nice indeed
again it's got its own en suite bathroom which has got two windows one on this side and this one looks down over the garden and out to the land beyond and it's a very good place to consider that in this property there is the land and it's considerably under budget so there'd be some money to put into the kitty to build that swimming pool
well looking at that i'm quite surprised because for a period property i could almost be tempted could you yeah i quite liked it
it had quite nice gardens and ground and the buildings were quite useful it's not a house i would have looked at on the brochure
still to come on escape to the country my third property takes roger and ann's breath away
what a view fantastic gorgeous isn't it
swimming pool nearly
hi simon nice to see you well one of my requirements was to find my couple some space and some good views i think we can say you fulfil that here
it's one of the best views i think you can find in this area
oh wow look at that look at the view gosh
standing here it sounds like we're standing next to niagara falls a very grand pond area here yes it's almost like a lake yes isn't it
i like that you can walk onto this little bridge and come out onto this island piece that's lovely
right brilliant we've got a couple of doors here what's in here
a large clothes cupboard to this side and to the left we've got a downstairs toilet which accesses to the garage
into this lovely spacious hallway yes stairs obviously going up to the bedrooms
a very nice staircase leading up
that's a lovely hallway it is nice actually that is it's very nice indeed
this archway leads into what looks like a very spacious kitchen yes so that's good what's in there
this leads through to the utility room so you've got even more space with that
got a butler sink
yeah like ours now
this is the kitchen proper
and the owners had it built for themselves they wanted it low maintenance and efficient so you've got double glazed windows and also on the ground floor it has a water fed underfloor central heating system
very good no radiators
i hadn't thought of that that's good does it work well yes
i know that a. n. n. will really love this because one of her wish list things was to have somewhere that she could eat that was close to the kitchen but had patio doors right accessing outside
that's very nice indeed nice sliding windows to the garden that's lovely
this is the back garden so there is a bit of space at the back
garden at the back as well as the front let's explore that
no most of it's pots actually and some evergreen shrubs
and the little sort of semi garage
you've got quite a large storage shed
it's nice but would there be room for the pool
back across the hallway down to the rest of the rooms what have we got here simon
you've got a large double bedroom on the ground floor
plenty of space i wonder if the units are all built in
what's that door straight ahead of us we've got a ground floor bathroom right excellent now this is an all important room for me because roger and a. n. n. run a business from home so obviously a home office is crucial let's go and have a look at the sitting room very important room and i would say it's a pretty good one indeed
i mean look at that for a view
yes gosh that is gorgeous isn't it what a view
i like the way it's decorated and the look of it that's lovely
i mean obviously with a view like that they had it made lower so when you're sitting you can enjoy the view
you'd never get anything done you'd just sit here looking out at that all going on outside
very nice view beautiful view
lovely looking out at all the water
so there are three bedrooms in this property one that we've already seen downstairs and two up here on the first floor this is bedroom one now this is technically a dormer bungalow and given that the current owners had this house built specifically for them it's such a shame because as you can see we're up in the roof and unless you are significantly taller than me or you stand on a big box you can't actually see the view from upstairs so that's a bit of a shame but this is something to make any storage freak's heart sing a really huge walk in wardrobe there
it's very good i'm sure we'd soon fill that wouldn't we
and then next door even better in here a really good en suite bathroom which has got a separate shower cubicle and a bath
very nice nice tiling and everything the whole thing's very tastefully done
gosh i thought the previous one was the master bedroom that's gorgeous
this is a little seating area now unfortunately they can't sit and enjoy the view but you can see it standing up you just need to be pottering around to enjoy it
suppose one has to compromise somewhere
another thing is that the underfloor heating is upstairs as well so here's a little thermostat you can control each room
when you get out of bed it will keep your feet warm won't it
that'd be nice
very modern isn't it yeah yeah split level
hello catherine nice to see you
right i've been looking at the floor plan of this house and it's quite unusual i can't quite work it out explain where everything is
it's split over three levels to the left is the main bedroom and then upstairs we have the living room and the kitchen
oh yeah that's just my scene that that's beautiful yeah
and i like the fact that you've got sort of the breakfast bar option
oh wow now it becomes apparent why they've done this topsy turvy business with the accommodation it's so you've got this lovely elevated position with fantastic views the sight distracts me from the room so let's concentrate on the sitting room which is a good size
i love the pale carpets makes the place look so spacious
so this is the all important land so exactly how much land is there here katie
approximately two acres extending to where the tree line goes out
right so this row of trees that i can see so it's a sort of rectangular paddock
and it's split into two paddocks
there would be enough room here for whatever we wanted to keep and we'd get a swimming pool in there i'd say yeah i should think we would
so basically that's your main living rooms on the top floor so to speak this is the bedrooms floor here and then there are more stairs down
that goes down to the lower ground floor let's go down there next
what have we got down here katie
we have a utility room
very good size that's brilliant what's through here that's the garage oh right oh oh my goodness i nearly fell straight down is that an inspection pit
it certainly is fantastic
it's tailor made for roger because he wanted a double garage so he could get some cars and tinker with them
very handy having a pit
very handy yeah if you've got to do jobs and things that's lovely
right then down again wow this is a great room is this what you call bedroom five
yes but they currently use it as an office space and a children's playroom
right so lots of options for this i actually think it might work quite well for roger and a. n. n. as an office because it's a really good size and it's separate from the rest of the house
lots of light through the windows
it would be good as a study but we could always use it as a games room
we could get a pool table in there yeah it would be lovely
so this lower floor really houses the utilities and it's the middle floor which has all the bedrooms on it and tucked around the corner is the family bathroom now this really is very sparklingly modern very recently fitted it's got tiled floors all very natural colours a good bath and it's got a shower as well
i'm not sure about the wash basin but i love the rest yeah
the bedrooms aren't huge but they're good proportions you can easily get a double bed in here and the big bonus here is that it's got its own en suite bathroom and it's a really good bathroom cos it's got a bath and a very funky shower one that you can pretend is a microphone
that's good that see me singing into the showerhead
that's a good bathroom
it's very good it's lovely
there are four bedrooms in this area in total one there we've got two at the far end of the house that one's at the front this one's at the back equally sized they're not huge but that one's big enough for a princess we could probably get a double bed in there as well and then across the corridor is the master bedroom now again it's not vast but it's obviously really nicely appointed it's so sparkling i'm almost afraid to tread on these carpets they're so pristine and this has also got an en suite it's an en suite shower room the only downside and this is possibly the only downside i've found so far is that it hasn't actually got a loo but all of that may well be written off in terms of concerns by the fact that it's got patio doors leading out to the garden and i'm hoping that roger and a. n. n. will really like this feature so you step out into the sort of garden area of the land it's fairly low maintenance there's a little bit of lawn and a few beds here what i really love about this is the bench here so they can potter out in the morning sit down with a cup of coffee and they can look out over their livestock
ah i love the double doors from the bedroom don't you
they're really nice that is lovely and you can come straight out onto the patio and look over the garden
right station house wymondham
did you like it not the interior no
i didn't like all the wood and everything
no did you like the outside it could have been all right but i didn't like the house
no i didn't like the house shall i put this away and this one is rose cottage this was a very nice house i was surprised at how much i did like it shall we put it on the maybe pile for the moment all right then and the one at thorpe satchville that was a gorgeous place wasn't it
yeah did like it i would like to see that one
yes yes i think i would too shall we put that as a definite yes
i'd definitely like to see it
so the meadows did you like the meadows better than rose cottage
yes i did yes i did too there'd definitely be enough room for whatever we wanted to keep here and there would be room for a pool
so we would definitely like to view the meadows yeah definitely thorpe satchville and the meadows yeah
so we're off to leicestershire to view the first property in thorpe satchville and it's looking a lot more wintry than when i was here a week ago
hello catherine how are you
very well thank you lovely snowy day
oh i'll say very unexpected
now so there's property number one what do you think of it from the outside it looks great
it does look great it looks very pretty
because this was built as a low maintenance house there's nothing on the outside which needs updating or painting
that sounds great what about this area out here it's lovely isn't it it's not quite a swimming pool
no not quite but nearly there yeah it's lovely
let's head on up and have a look at the house itself so follow me in we come so you've got a little sort of a smaller hallway there with your coat cupboard and your downstairs loo then this is the main hallway so what do you think of this
i think it's lovely what are you liking about it
the modernness yeah it's lovely really nice just the fact it feels new yes and new and clean and it feels warm
right let's go this way first you've got a utility room through there
that's useful isn't it
it's lovely it's very very pretty
have you got enough work surface here
well i would think so at first glance
what do you think about having this table here maybe it's a bit cramped
yes looking through the archway there seems to be another dining area so perhaps we would just use that
yes and then you'd have a really good space here wouldn't you yes right so yes and you had spotted that through another arch
yes i like the archways
the sort of formal dining room what about those lovely patio doors at the end
just right
that was one of your bonuses
i know i know yeah they're nice aren't they roger those just the job aren't they
i think this would be big enough actually the way it's set out because we don't need a massive space in the middle as long as there's space on each side right i think it would be big enough that's the office sorted just the sitting room to see
my favourite room so follow me the final room on this floor i'll let you go in first in you go roger all right what do you think
it's great isn't it what a view fantastic gorgeous isn't it
you asked me for views i know and you wanted a view didn't you so do you approve of the view roger yes i do
yeah it's beautiful
so sit down do a test run so here we can all sit in comfort
oh yes that's gorgeous yes i approve of that it's beautiful
i was really pleased when i found this what do you think of the room itself roger
it's sort of cosy isn't it it's very cosy yes excellent
i'm getting very positive feelings so far from the ground floor
that's right we've got the master bedroom and everything upstairs looking forward to that
and the issue of the alpacas so i'm going to let you two go off and have a wander around on your own we'll get together later and see what you think
and we could keep seven alpacas on here that would be good and i think we could get a pool in here if we took that wall down and moved it back and extended the roof over the top we could cover it
oh wicked we could go skinny dipping ooh missus
so you've seen everything what do you think
lovely it's a really pretty house
i'm a bit concerned about the view from upstairs when you're sitting down
if that's your one disappointment that's not too bad
it's not indeed no it's lovely
let's not keep you in suspense any longer we'll go and have a look at the meadows
lovely thank you
right so here we are property number two the weather isn't being very kind cos it's now raining but even in the rain what do you think of it from the outside
it looks very nice and i'm quite excited to see inside
the wow factor is inside and on the other side of the building so let's get inside and have a look there follow me in we come so this is the house that's slightly topsy turvy so it's all on different floors so how do you feel about that
well we're not really too sure we'd like to view the whole property before we make up our minds on that factor
yep it is very modern as you say yes the kitchen part is very nice and lovely gas range
i feel it's sort of soulless actually i know what you mean you want something to bring it to life
and then you've got this sort of open plan dining area
yes over here it's a very good space isn't it very large it is large yeah
so the crucial thing is do you think that you could give it soul
i should think so yes i'm sure we could my wife could anyway
i'm sure you could give it some soul as well roger
i do as i'm told
in this instance i'm going to tell you to go across the hallway and we'll go and have a look at the sitting room next right great so off we go
ah goodness so wow
light isn't it it's very light
yes and a very nice view i like the picture windows all along there
can you picture yourselves living here yes
we could do of course there is a balcony there
so i'm going to let you come back later and have a look at the land and the garden and everything first we're going to the bottom of the house and look at what could be the office leave the bedrooms till later right in the bottom of the house you've got your utility room right garage in there good bit for roger to come back and have a look at later but then if we go right down so we're right at the bottom of the house this is what i thought could be your office
right yup that's a nice big space isn't it
yeah quite high ceiling too
yes very high yes yes it would certainly be a very good space for an office
but how are you feeling about the house from what you've seen so far
i'm not really one hundred per cent convinced about it i haven't got that gut feeling
yeah i feel like that i don't like the high windows there for example
so it's just little things that you're picking up going along yes you were excited about seeing this one weren't you yes i was i'm going to leave you to explore all the rest of it and we'll get together later and see what you think yeah great thank you very much
yeah i think we could we asked for views here and we certainly got them it would be great and we could watch the alpacas and sit drinking wine what could be better
i've been looking for the loo in the en suite but there isn't one
that's a bit of a nuisance in the middle of the night isn't it still there are patio doors and that's what i did ask for and it's a nice bonus but i wish the room was a little bit bigger
they've got an inspection pit i could spend hours under the car with that
oh yes it's all right for you i'd probably never see you you'd be here all the time
so you've seen both properties and the burning question is do you like either of them enough to put in an offer
yes we do ooh yes we're quite excited
so which one the first one well i'm surprised because we started the day i think i'm right in saying you both preferred this property that's right on paper on paper that's the crucial thing what went wrong when we looked round
didn't like the decor and we got a bit fed up with going up and down the stairs all the time
yeah so what really sold that house to you roger
we found the first one very attractive and homely and there was virtually no maintenance the fact that we could get a swimming pool in and also the ground up the road
i love the kitchen and i think the lounge with that fantastic view is beautiful
you sent me off to find a house with land for the alpacas the only house that i found that didn't have land with it is the one that you like the best
that's right sorry about that
i don't mind because i'm pleased that we found a house you really like so are you actually going to cut the mustard and put in an offer
we've got somebody coming to view our house at nine hundred thirty this morning and so depending on that then that will determine whether we actually make the offer now or as soon as it's sold
well i'll keep my fingers crossed do keep me posted and when you get your first alpaca wool mittens then let me know
we'll send them to you thank you for all your help
we are in the city of london with princes william and harry for this evening's unique tribute good evening welcome to saint paul's in the heart of the city you can see behind us some of tonight's invited guests and crowds have gathered below us to salute the men and women of the british armed forces and their families where better to make that salute than here in the heart of the city with saint paul's behind us looking gorgeous in the sunshine the fortunes of the city have been entwined with those in the armed forces the city institutions relied on the army and navy to protect their trading interests around the world the city provided huge amounts of funds for the forces' upkeep london has been the home of servicemen for centuries in the last one hundred years london was at the frontline of conflicts more than once that pictures reminds us of the wonderful shot of the dome of saint paul's during the blitz in nineteen forty the forces are incredibly busy at the minute deployed in eighty countries around the world remember they have no choice about where or when they serve so this is a chance for the people of london all of us in the country to say thank you to them and all the people that support them princes william and harry have played a key role in supporting tonight's events and are both young serving officers for many members of the royal family joining the armed forces is a key part of their career both prince william and prince harry have completed military training in the u. k. with prince william earning his r. a. f. wings just recently william and harry's dedication has gone further earlier this year prince harry was stationed in afghanistan and worked shoulder to shoulder with his fellow troops prince william has also been to afghanistan where he flew flew in to bring homes troops at the ends of their tour and sadly a fatality as well earlier this week prince harry received his campaign medal for his time in afghanistan but for the princes the true heroes who deserve to be recognised are those who have been injured while fighting for their country their recent visit to headley court the rehabilitation centre for injured members of the armed forces allowed them to recognise not only the injured troops but also the medics and families who support them the two royal princes are here tonight chatting to some of the injured servicemen and women and their families and some of the supporters of tonight's occasion
all dressed up in your glad rags very smart have you come from
no we came on our own
good stuff with the weather it's brilliant it was really good to visit the other day did you see the coverage out that came out after it
straight after we got whisked off to the houses of parliament so i only caught a bit of it
you are a busy man you are a celebrity now mate you can't remember how many times you have dyed your hair
l. haven't seen you before
i was injured july oh five so spent a year in selly oak and headley court and the
i was at the defence academy i left headley court last august and now just getting back into it and doing a masters degree at the staff college
how is that
going o. k. so far
i am joined by the events host this evening jeremy clarkson what are you going to be doing later today
armed forces
begin let's join dan snow as the city and royal princes salute the men and women of the british armed forces and their families the peel of the bells of saint paul's signalling the start of tonight's event next up like all the best state occasions it will be started with fanfare from the state trumpeters we have william and harry giving a distinctive feel to this event playing rejoicing trumpeters wearing distinctive uniform of any in the british forces first appeared in charles the second's reign now we are waiting for the latest addition to the r. a. f.'s fleet three typhoons that distinctive delta wing shape coming out on the horizon here had out doing fight any plane on the planet these ones they are at the frontline of britain's air defence system can get to thirty six thousand feet in about two minutes flown by countless computers on board flying back off
good evening welcome to the city salute this is an event which celebrates the work done by the armed forpss and perhaps more importantly thanks them for doing it it was paratrooper called ben parkinson who i see over here is with us this evening who first opened my eyes to the plight of the soldier who has been wounded and the struggle that they face getting back some kind of normal life once their lives have been saved a lot of them end up in place called headley court this is the force's rehabilitation centre in surrey a great many people have been helped by the staff there and one of them is a chap we are going to hear from now royal marine mark ormrod
this is the band of her majesty's royal marines portsmouth they will be providing all the music for this evening it is important to remember when you look at these guys they are actually all based on active service as well as playing in the bands as well started off with the sea shanty hearts of oak and now on to life on the ocean wave
three major roles the first is daily tasking we supply water food ammunition to the troops on the ground the second tafpbgs that we do is a taskss that we do is deliver to troops on the ground and the one most applicable this evening is we provide a casualty evacuation service so if there are any guys injured on the ground we'll take off and go get them
these are incredible aircraft can you tell my what ner capable of
if you spend enough time out there a routine does develop there are set things that we do but the casualty evacuation you don't know when or where it will happen so
it takes a special kind of courage to fly one of those things into a firefight because it is a
commander a gun operator and a
twenty seconds general salute
ladies and gentlemen please welcome timothy west
i want tow move the ball into that position
could carry on skiing was by far the most fun i've ever had on one leg or two legs it was amazing that was wicked again i love the sensation of looking down at my crutches and jumping and just freedom it was brilliant wicked l. love the army i would do it again l. would l. really would i won't be able to do the job i was doing out in iraq there's no ways i could do that but i could be in the med centre treating patients don't get me wrong it is still very difficult and very hard what with realising the sort of psychological change in myself from who i was to who i am now it's not easy but yes it is onwards and upwards ladies and gentlemen rory mackenzie it's funny how today children aren't allowed to play conkers unless they are wearing a floor to ceiling flak jacket you cannot empty a dustbin unless you are wearing a bright orange jacket and i wasn't surprised that the bandsmen had to wear earplug persist we expect to be safe as we go about our business and yet people like rory and so many others here tonight choose to do a job that absolutely isn't safe or comfortable or council to think of it particularly well paid and then there are their families who have to stay at home and worry while they are away it's hard to imagine how difficult that must be so this city salute is for you guys too it really is now it gives me great pleasure to introduce the lord mayor of london who it turns out isn't boris johnson it is in fact the right honourable david lewis the lord mayor is an ambassador for the city carrying out engagements at home and abroad he has the incredible colour of twenty eight golden emblems collar aed by his bodyguard his muskmen and pipemen confident oliver docherty of the
thank you all and now ladies and gentlemen three cheers for all the members of her majesty's armed forces and their families hip hip hooray hooray hip hip
this programme contains some strong language twenty two miles of hard road thirty three years of tough love forty four skulls buried in the ground crawl down through the mud ah yeah that's my train i've gotta go on to the next fantastic voyage into my father's brain have you seen my dad's brain around here
your dad's theory is one of the most important discoveries of all time in science i'd put it right up there with einstein's relativity theory newton's theory of gravity
there really are very large numbers of versions of you that really exist
now you're blowing my mind good ah yeah hello nice to see you
there's nothing that i wanna do more than get alone and be with you trouble with dreams is they don't come true and when they do they can catch up to you
but what many of mark's fans don't know is that his father hugh everett was a brilliant quantum mechanic he developed the ground breaking theory of parallel universes a scientific theory that has seeped into the worlds of film music and literature and is part of our everyday vocabulary
i don't remember knowing when he was alive that he was a famous physicist i don't know if i ever even knew that till after he died dad mom can you hear me my dad who was a devout atheist of course his dying wish was to be thrown out in the trash and my mom kept his ashes in a filing cabinet in the dining room at our house for a few years and then eventually honoured his wish and threw him in the trash that's the truth here's my mom this is the one i've never seen it before it was something she wanted me to take care of after she died oh there's one for my sister too i've never seen that wait where's my father's stone i just don't get it it's a mystery
mark's father was a distracted genius lost in his own world they lived in the same house for twenty years yet they barely spoke in fact one of mark's lingering memories of his father was a distressing day in july nineteen eighty two
it was the weirdest thing because i walked in their bedroom and there he was laying there like sideways on the bed fully clothed with his tie on like he always had on i tried to wake him up and when i put my arms under him and i picked him up his body was completely stiff and it was just so surreal because i was touching him which is the only time i could remember having any physical contact with him and it was just all so so obviously it was very traumatic and a horrific scene but it was also had the added surreal quality for me because you know my father had just died but i barely knew him so it was hard to know how to feel like a normal person would feel in that situation i guess it's pretty sad that the one really intimate experience i had with him was while he was dead you know i don't leave the house much i don't like being around people it's better for me to stay home some might think it means i hate people but that's not quite right
mark fiercely guards his privacy but he's opening himself up to confront something that until now he's only been able to deal with in his lyrics
it's been almost the exclusive way that i've dealt with my situation writing a song about my family
he wants to find out why a scientist as outstanding as his father turned his back on academia's glittering prizes
understanding how his father came up with the concept of parallel universes will be tricky because science was never mark's strong point
i only have a very very vague understanding of my father's theory it gets up to a certain point and it becomes like impenetrable and then it gets into the scientist language which is like blah blah it's like a different alphabet they are using practically
blinking lights on the airplane wings up above the trees
set me on the ground once more again
hello mark you dressed for me absolutely who could turn down this opportunity i mean how often does a rock star come to my house
it's good to see you hey it's delightful to see you how long's it been twenty five years
twenty five years you are now so old that you are the age i was when you last saw me
really wow you guys are always doing the math
always doing strange stuff yeah so come in thanks and be comfortable there's a bathroom there if you need fluids here we can sit down great
when did you first meet my father
u. m. nineteen seventy it was a job interview and he very timidly i know that's not what you think of but very very timidly said have you by any chance seen my paper on quantum mechanics
that day yeah and i said oh my god you're that hugh everett cos i had seen it and thought it was the work of a raving lunatic and told him you said that and he thought it was very funny and so we knew we could enjoy each other
wow even though he was a constant physical presence he's really a complete mystery as a person to me what was he like that's what i don't really know
um he was peculiar and a bit eccentric he was a very good friend to me in his way i will show you something that friendship and contrast you have here
yeah and otherwise you look like completely different species city guy and mountain guy and yet we were really good friends
don is an expert in quantum mechanics and starts mark off nice and easy on his quest to understand his father's theory all you need is a pencil
if i take a pencil and i cut it in half and cut it in half and cut it in half and just get ever ever smaller pieces at some point one may run out of something i can cut in half you've gotten to the point where the pencil no longer can be subdivided you've come to something that's no longer bits of a pencil but is something more fundamental and that was the notion of an atom
atoms are the buildings blocks of the universe microscopic particles that make up everything we see around us from houses and guitars to rock musicians they're so small that there are more atoms in a full stop than all the pencils in the world if you could somehow look inside one of these atoms you might see what it's made of in the middle is a concentrated ball of material called the nucleus around the nucleus are tiny particles called electrons these electrons spin super quick around the nucleus now this is the crazy bit the classical laws of physics seem to work fine for everything much bigger than an atom for instance newton's gravity makes apples go down rather than up at an intuitive level these classical laws make perfect sense but the classical laws all break down when it comes to really tiny stuff like atoms the electrons don't fly around the nucleus in nice regular orbits like planets around the sun but instead they are smeared out around the nucleus taking on a cloud like form
what's that flaming ball in the sky
and even weirder still they are everywhere at once welcome to the quantum world
what do you think about this you know my father clearly on top of his game with the mathematics and whatnot and i the furthest i got was i flunked out of the easiest ninth grade algebra class i just couldn't grasp it
right i just didn't inherit that gene yeah um i've thought a lot about that
about how stupid i was in math
i think i'd have phrased it differently did maybe my father speak of it no no what a disappointment i was he would have been very very pleased with what you did with your music
i feel like an old railroad man riding out on the bluemont line humming along old dominion blues not much to see and not much left to lose and i know i can walk along the tracks it may take a little longer but i'll know how to find my way back like bon jovi life in a rock band sucks man on a steel horse i ride wanted dead or alive
hugh everett wanted to win a place at princeton university to study for a p. h. d. and be close to his hero einstein a glowing reference from hugh's professor confirms that he was already a budding genius
it says this is a once in a lifetime recommendation for i think it most unlikely that i shall ever again encounter a student i can give such complete and unreserved support yeah that sounds like a ringing endorsement
hugh arrived at princeton in nineteen fifty three at the age of twenty two after a year studying maths he was persuaded to switch to the far more glamorous quantum mechanics the man who was the catalyst was professor john wheeler his new mentor wheeler was keen on a particular experiment it's called the double slit experiment and physics professors love it because it's the perfect way to demonstrate the weird quantum behaviour of tiny particles
i'll tell you what nature behaves like and if you will simply admit that maybe she does behave like this you will find her a delightful entrancing thing so that's the way to look at the lectures not to try to understand i think i can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics
mark is going to be shown the double slit experiment by yi ma a technician at princeton's physics department
you want to see this experiment
is this laser going to blow my eyes out or something
no they are very er i went to a who concert in seventh grade and the laser went right in my eyes
and i've had to wear glasses ever since i see
you don't know what a photon is
wow i'm sorry i asked
no it's a good question very good question i didn't mean to put you on the spot
to oversimplify enormously photons are tiny particles of light electrons and photons behave similarly and both obey quantum laws but because we can actually see photons as light they're ideal for this experiment from the laser apparatus single photons fire off one at a time the individual particles then arrive at a plastic barrier with two narrow slits on the other side is a sensitive t. v. camera to film where the photons end up
so the photons will hit the film what do you expect you expect we'll hit two spots here like that or you expect the photons will go all over the map what do you expect we have two slits here
the choices are all over the map or just those two spots yeah er just the two spots
exactly mark is using his common sense imagine this experiment was blown up to a much larger scale so that the particles are tennis balls and a machine is firing the tennis balls at a barrier with two gaps in it of course you'd expect to find the balls hitting the back wall in two places in line with the two slits but when our experiment is done with individual photons from the laser something very different happens
each flash of light is actually an individual photon hitting the back wall they appear to be landing all over the place but watch over time and a pattern emerges
can you see somewhere in the middle of the screen it looks like a smudge yeah it looks like a smudge those are where the photon hits but it's not two as we would expect is that weird
yes so why is that that's right why is that
instead of the two vertical bands that you'd expect a series of vertical smudges appear to make sense of this pattern you need to look at it from the perspective of a single photon this photon is landing in a place on the back wall that would be physically impossible if it were travelling straight through just one of the slits so the only explanation is that the particle has gone through both slits simultaneously by the time it reaches the back wall it has come together again as one photon multiply this single photon one thousand fold and you have the distinctive pattern that mark saw think about it a photon arrives at the slits in a hell of a quantum state and travels through both a single object is in two places at once
now you're blowing my mind good that's our job to do
to blow people's minds so make you think right
my brain hurts
and it's not just photons that behave like this the double slit experiment has been replicated with electrons and with atoms but we are made up of atoms so atoms can be in two places at the same time why can't we one man thought he had the answer the godfather of quantum mechanics niels bohr he'd won the nobel prize for his research into the atom during world war two bohr escaped the nazis and ended up helping the allies develop the first atomic bomb while there he gave a lecture to the students by this time bohr had overthrown einstein as the giant of the physics world for a student to challenge him he'd have to be very naive or very arrogant it could be argued that hugh everett was both
oh yeah yeah
that's me and hale and this is niels bohr
this photograph was taken just before bohr's lecture the other men pictured are hugh's fellow students and they've come back to the college for their own reunion
everyone's wearing gowns that was required in those days dinner gowns
at dinner yeah there was a big fight about them lucky you didn't have to wear the powdered wigs
they were also convenient for an occasional sneaking in of a female
so what's going on here bohr has come to give a lecture yeah he'd come to give a lecture
so this is where talks would be given this would be the place where bohr would have given his talk that evening
i was sitting over in a soft seat here and bohr was sitting about here with a group of all the important physicists sitting around plus hale i think with their ears going like this and i was just snoring over in the corner
but he was known to talk very slowly and mumble never quite finishes his sentences because he was thinking so deeply about getting everything right
if hugh's old pal harvey had managed to stay awake he may have learnt the world according to bohr bohr proposed that everything be divided into two categories big stuff like tennis balls apples falling off trees obeys the classical laws of physics however small stuff about the size of atoms obeys the crazy laws of quantum mechanics bohr didn't stop there he described what happens when you look at something very tiny at that exact moment the particle stops behaving so weirdly instead of being in multiple quantum states once observed it's in just one state it's now a nice well behaved little particle the whole shebang was called the copenhagen interpretation and thanks to bohr became the established view oh by the way copenhagen was bohr's hometown but the young and ambitious hugh thought it was all most unlikely how can just by looking at something affect the very behaviour of a physical object hugh was convinced that bohr had it wrong and so he decided to start on his own radical theory helped on most evenings by a sherry or five
harvey yes please for a while we had fairly regular sherry meetings before dinner very cheap sherry so a toast to hugh great having a chance to
what are your memories of my father as a person back then
he surprised me from the time that i met him until i got to know him that he was as brilliant as he was it didn't come across until you got close to him
do you think he was the smartest guy
well he was smart in a very broad way
do you think he thought he was the smartest guy i think he did but he didn't broadcast it he certainly didn't around our house i was not aware that he was a genius physicist i don't think ever until after he died
that's interesting
which room was my dad's
it's the room up there with the open window
wow that's like the penthouse did they put the smartest guys up at the top is that how it works yeah probably is that the room where he wrote his theory yeah it must have been that's exciting so what year would this have been when you lived here fifty three nineteen fifty three that's right yeah fifty three to fifty four just coming into my father's bedroom now so if you lay in the bed in this room it's said you'll come up with crazy theories this is exciting like in the music world this would be like going to the abbey road studios or something interestingly enough i didn't inherit any of his mathematical genius i have trouble adding up the tip at dinner
i wonder what you feel you understand about your father's theory
i understand that up to the point of anything that can be happening is happening somewhere the somewhere part is the hard part to wrap my brain around you know i feel like i'm in a science show now
a meeting with max tegmark top physicist and hugh devotee is set to bend mark's brain further out of shape
it's a real honour to get to meet you because your dad has just been such an inspiration to me when i was a grad student in berkeley i found in this old bookstore a copy of this one hundred thirty seven page paper that your dad wrote and i was like wow it suddenly all made sense and since then i've spent many years working on your dad's theory and various implications of it and it's just so cool for me to actually get to meet you here and to even have a chance to help you understand
mark's father wasn't the only one who found bohr's theory difficult to swallow so did the physicist erwin schrodinger
as schrodinger himself pointed out in a famous article there is something really weird about this idea of dividing the world into two parts because you are made out of atoms so if an atom can be in two places at once so can you right
schrodinger had devised an experiment to expose this absurdity he came up with the most famous feline experiment in science schrodinger's cat it goes like this a cat is penned up in a steel chamber along with a radioactive substance such as uranium a geiger counter attached to a quick release hammer and a flask of poisonous gas hydrocyanic acid
no yeah he doesn't even have legs and now you're going to poison him
don't blame me blame schrodinger
schrodinger was never diabolical enough to do this for real it was just a thought experiment at the heart of it all is a quantum event every now and then completely randomly there's a chance of a uranium atom decaying and emitting radiation this radiation is enough to trigger the counter that sets off the hammer that breaks the vial that poisons the cat but if none of the uranium atoms decay over the duration of the experiment the cat will live
what's so disturbing about this is the fate of a single atom determines the fate of a cat
according to the copenhagen interpretation until the experiment is observed by peering inside the entire contents of the box exists in two possible states each uranium atom both has and has not decayed and still further the poisonous gas has both killed and not killed the cat and this is the paradox a single cat that is both dead and alive at the same time that's what schrodinger couldn't buy and neither could hugh in the winter of nineteen fifty four sometime after the bohr lecture fortified by some sherry and chat with bohr's assistant aage petersen hugh came up with the theory of parallel universes hugh argued that everything in the universe big and small obeys the laws of quantum mechanics and instead of the observer hugh introduced the notion of splitting splitting occurs every time a quantum event happens and this is how parallel universes are created
how does my father's theory solve the two different outcomes of the cat experiment
it says that both outcomes actually happen
the paradox of schrodinger's cat had been that the one cat was both dead and alive at the same time hugh solved the problem with parallel universes two cats existing in separate worlds one cat dead the other alive hugh's theory was visionary and backed up by some serious maths he was only twenty four years old
some people think you have a problem but that problem lies only with them beautiful freak beautiful freak
in my personal opinion your dad's theory is one of the most important discoveries of all time in science and i just can't emphasise enough how important i think it is and i would put it right up there with einstein's relativity theory newton's theory of gravity and so on and i think fifty years from now he's going to be even more famous than he is now when more experiments have confirmed that this seems to be the way the world works
i'm starting to understand a lot more now just need to come out here into the nice princeton air shake my head a little and let it all settle and talk to the squirrels so if one squirrel gets the decayed poison and the other squirrel gets the non decayed poison oh shit now there's three of them now i'm really confused here we go walk myself down sycamore street the sun beats down no shoes on my feet don't use that
on the foundations of quantum mechanics i haven't heard that title before recommended for acceptance by the department of physics march nineteen fifty seven so this is the opening of the theory this is getting weird because i know what that means now what's happening to me
what hugh had done was reconfigure the framework of quantum mechanics by taking out the need for an observer that bohr relied on with the hubris of youth hugh hoped that bohr would recognise his parallel universe theory as a breakthrough a validation of his genius in the spring of nineteen fifty nine hugh everett travelled with his wife nancy and young daughter liz to copenhagen hugh's mentor john wheeler had arranged a meeting between his student and bohr wheeler was worried and had already made hugh shorten his research paper and tone his language down so as not to antagonise the grandmaster even so the stage was set for a showdown
this is just a picture of the view from across the street of the bohr institute as it was when your father was there talking with bohr
oh so that's where it happened that's where it happened yeah
this is a picture of the two of us which we believe your father took
oh yeah yeah that's a nice shot
yeah
mark is seeing hugh's old college pal charlie misner again they last met at the grad college reunion charlie and his wife susannah were also in copenhagen in nineteen fifty nine charlie was witness at the make or break meeting with bohr
we should have danish we are talking about denmark
what happened when my father presented his theory to bohr
bohr was deeply involved for decades with a view of quantum mechanics that he had developed and was essentially totally accepted throughout the world of thousands of physicists doing it every day and to expect that on the basis of a one hour talk by a kid he was going to totally change his viewpoint would be unrealistic i doubt that there was any striking meeting of minds there
do you think some of it had to do with their egos maybe on both sides
yeah each of them was sure that they had gone over all this in their own minds and they knew exactly what was the right way to think about it and it was very hard to find a way to arrange a meeting of the minds
so ended one of the great scientific debates of the twentieth century bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics remained triumphant and young everett's new idea was to be ignored
it must have been incredibly frustrating to feel like he'd come up with something so ground breaking and then just have it brushed under the rug
right yeah
it was very sad yeah he was always joking when we were around but i sense the joking was like the clown jokes
the tears of a clown yeah
that's certainly possible
to me it'd make sense why he was this isolated presence in the household just sitting there and not really saying much
i see is that right
i sensed that he was not really happy
yeah i think that he was definitely depressed
his mother was somewhat bipolar wasn't she
yeah she spent time in mental hospitals
and what about your sister
and my sister yeah was she having also depressions yeah severe
i think i could sense that hugh was
there was a little strain of crazy in the family
well we have it in our family my sister committed suicide and liz also took her own life yeah
you know when liz committed suicide in her suicide note she wrote that she was going off meet her father in a parallel universe
she was a very intelligent girl it's very sad
depression ran in hugh's family and the rejection of his theory must have been a humiliating blow for him when hugh realised the scientific establishment would never accept his brilliant theory he left academia for good and his theory disappeared into the university archives
i think i've gotten to a turning point where i am really glad i'm doing this it's getting interesting now to the me that split off and didn't come on this trip you lazy sack of shit i really feel propelled by the sadness of the tragedy of my father not getting the recognition he deserved because he was just too far ahead of his time maybe too smart too soon being too smart too soon he didn't really get a chance to pursue more i think cos he felt like what's the fucking point if no one's gonna listen to me i'm getting more comfortable with who my father is the more i'm learning about him and the more i feel like i'm getting to know him the more i like him you know i know he seems like a good guy to me overall he had his problems obviously he tried pretty hard and in his own weird way he's already done more than i've done in terms of being a father so you know got to give him that much he let me play drums in the house that's my train i've gotta go on to the next fantastic voyage into my father's brain gotta go
mark has finally summoned the courage to face something he's been putting off for years
my father died when i was nineteen my sister died several years later and my mom died soon after she did and at that point one had to go out and clean out the family house i boxed up a whole bunch of stuff of my father's and it's all been sitting under my house all these years and i've never looked at any of it and you know it's a painful world to open up
so how long have these boxes been here
they've been here like eight years
for hugh everett's biographer peter byrne this is an eagerly anticipated scientific goldmine some new clues about his father
wow man this is a really cool basement
it's a little dusty
wow there's a treasure trove here where do you want to start well why not just work as they say linearly start with the
that one over there yeah
it's another rock'n'roll party saturday for me
this is the footnotes to quantum mechanics paper
this is the kind of stuff i would always see him writing at the dining room table it would look like this stuff which looks like another language
yeah that's linear algebra it's quantum mechanics it's the language that they use for it that's a really good photo man he looks bushy tailed and bright eyed
that didn't last long no one took him seriously and he lost the fire in his eyes
happens every time i put an album out
oh yeah definitely cool this looks like tapes who knows what's on there man that's going to be amazing to listen to that who knows what's on there
the bad news is i remember dropping his dictaphone in the tub once when i was a kid really and ruining it but hopefully that's not the same one i don't know if i'd recognise his voice to be honest with you besides the fact that it's been twenty five years since he died i didn't hear him speak much in the eighteen years or nineteen years i lived in the house with him it would probably sound weird to me to hear his voice
oh there we go
let's see if it works that didn't sound good it might be the one i dropped in the tub when i was a kid
for such an important scientist archive material of hugh is surprisingly scarce there are very few photographs of him and no known film footage these dictaphone tapes might be the only recording ever made of hugh's voice
there's universes in which it worked
hey man what dig this well i went walking out yesterday a man was carrying a sign that says the world is gonna end tomorrow hey buddy got a nickel i can borrow this rotten world's gonna chew you up
going to the pentagon which i again never saw myself going to in my lifetime i don't think i've ever been there i don't think dad ever took me there for daddy son work day all i remember is that we had a teletype in the basement that was directly connected to the pentagon that was always spitting out all these important messages the world's about to blow up please wake up this rotten world gives you what you lack let's rock
at the weapons system evaluation group hugh could avoid the draft and earn a top salary he joined some of the brightest minds in the country in military research
hey george oh hi hi long time no see
hugh's colleague on this project was nuclear physicist doctor george pugh
i think the last time i remember really meeting you was a couple of times at your home at the time you were busy getting better and better playing the drums
that's right
due to their research hugh and george could warn president eisenhower that the military had completely underestimated the devastation of world war three
do you think my father had any moral issues working for the government you weren't a couple of trigger happy guys with the fate of the world at your hands
no after we briefed eisenhower there was a gradual shift in u. s. policy not to build so many twenty megaton weapons as they were doing and for god's sakes not to go to a one hundred megaton weapons
so you guys really made a positive difference in the world
i think we really did yeah it was as darn good thing somebody did what we did yeah i'll say
but it wasn't all bomb talk the fact that his brilliant theory had been banished to the archives was still close to hugh's heart
i think it was ahead of its time as a matter of fact he and i agreed that it was ahead of its time
yes i saw that some physicists are everettians some aren't everettians
i might try and get my music fans to call themselves everettians
i would like to hear your band some time
i think you'd like it it's sort of everettian rock uh huh life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy ma won't shave me jesus can't save me dog faced boy
hugh left the pentagon in nineteen sixty four taking with him a million dollars worth of government contracts he became the president of a private company which pioneered computerised nuclear war games that would be used by the military for decades to come his business grew and then something unexpected occurred
today is a lovely day to run start up the car with the sun
in may nineteen seventy seven hugh packed up the family and drove them to austin he'd been invited to give a lecture at the university of texas things were stirring in the quantum world hugh's theory had started to be referenced in articles and books there was a real buzz about parallel universes amongst a number of young physicists
he was a kind of star at the conference
for shy young physicist david deutsch later to become britain's leading expert on quantum mechanics it was a terrific opportunity to learn about the theory from its creator
he was deferred to almost like a star for instance i seem to remember that he was smoking and no one else was allowed to smoke
hugh everett had finally received the recognition he'd always craved
he seemed to be enjoying the conference he seemed to be firing on all six or eight or however many it was cylinders and was impressing everybody with the sharpness of his arguments
it was the beginning of a roll for the theory of parallel universes and soon it was seeping ever more into popular culture books television and films all embraced the concept as a staple plot device now they had some genuine science to go with their fiction but hugh everett would see little of this five years after the texas conference in nineteen eighty two hugh died of a heart attack exacerbated by his smoking and hard drinking he was only fifty one years old he had worked on his theory for just three years the rest of his life had been spent working for the military and in business
that got my dad excited it's weird hearing him be so talkative because i rarely ever heard him talk that much
it still feels that way a little bit
was that last month in austin then i know when this is it's interesting because my dad doesn't sound bitter at all i think he's sort of on a high because he'd just finally got some recognition this is a month after he went on the trip to austin he said like oh you should've been in austin
there's obviously something wrong here i showed the paradoxes and whatnot something should change
uh oh i'm playing drums
'. his ultimate conservatism kept coming through
not fazing my dad whatsoever you'll notice
you felt you had to put johnny on the straight and narrow end of this tape
it's so weird it's weird because it's like the sounds of my house there and yeah it's hard because as much as i hate to look back on it all i'd love to be back there for just one night maybe various voices duration twenty one minutes seven seconds sounds like a hit to me i think that's our cat purring i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure it's funny if that's my dad recording that if he's recording the cat purring i wouldn't be surprised you know he did have a thing with animals that was contrary to the way he was with humans which i also have too it turns out as you may have noticed i thought i heard a duck we didn't have a duck i wonder whether my delusions of grandeur came from him and then we've lost power because i told you this was a weird family we were all clearly experiments i'm turning out just like my father though i swore i never would i can say that i have love for him i never really understood what it must have been like for him living inside his head i feel like he's here with me now even though he's dead i feel like i know my father a lot better you know i feel a lot more connected to him i understand more like the whole timeline of events and when he was dreaming these things up when he actually did it and just talking to all these people that knew him and it's interesting it feels like he's around now you know more than i've ever felt that was too good that's just going to sound like we put that in in sounds effects you know it's too fucking perfect so in the end i'd like to say that i'm a very thankful man i have some regrets but if i had to do it all again well it's something i'd like to do i'm not a physics genius i can't even open an umbrella for years i haven't opened up any of the boxes under my house of my dad's stuff i've known it was coming eventually i was going to have to because of the mounting interest in him la la la la la la but now that i'm doing it i'm really glad i'm doing it it feels good it is such a genuine unique experience to go through however i still have a little bit of trepidation about the rest of my life having to be like the ambassador for the planet everett you know had i known this was coming i probably wouldn't have even attempted music and figured well i'll get girls this way then again physics guys not really the same as rock stars are they they are though in their world though you know my dad is a rock star of the physics world for sure thanks again ladies and gentlemen i can't look at the rocket launch the trophy wives of the astronauts i don't care for walking downtown crazy auto car gonna mow me down look at all the people like cows in a herd extraordinary scrap isn't it i extraordinary scrap isn't it i don't
this man is a refugee from one of the bloodiest wars in africa he found sanctuary in england
one two three
ben and the mussanzi family escaped the slaughter of civil war in the democratic republic of congo at least three million people died in the war and sporadic fighting continues to this day five years ago ben brought his wife kongossi and four of their children to bradford in africa kongossi tried to help victims of the war and because of her peace work the family were targeted by militia and had to flee for their lives but they didn't all get out their eldest daughter mapenzi remains in congo
doctor mapenzi
hello dad
hello how are you
fine tres bien
now they want to see her again
hi big sis
mapenzi stayed behind to qualify as a doctor two years ago she applied for a visa to enter the u. k. but this was refused the family daren't visit mapenzi because that might jeopardise their refugee status in this country now they hope the authorities will issue a visa to their daughter so the family can be reunited there are over a million immigrants working in britain a month ago jolanta bickova came from latvia to work in a hotel in lyme regis life is much easier for e. u. migrants they are free to come and go as they wish
after breakfast in the restaurant you can go up to housekeeping
now
the head waiter sigmund came from poland years ago
and go and action and action
i must try at home
no where this third one show me turn here
oh i have not so flexible hand like you
you should do these exercises
at home in bed before sleep action you think so i don't think so no because this plate is not good
when i see smile on her face that mean that she is fine no problem at all
thank you good boss good morning taxifast where's it going
it'll be with you in ten minutes
the largest taxi company in the south west employs ninety foreign drivers they have been recruiting in eastern europe since e. u. expansion in two thousand four
catalin dobrisan is the latest recruit but before he can join the ranks there's one more hurdle he must pass this driving test if he fails his dream of a new life in britain is over
stop
a dream which began three months ago in romania
you can expect to earn around one thousand per week gross no bullshit from me and we're desperately short of drivers in the taxi industry
catalin left his wife and family on the promise of earning more than twenty times his salary
i will miss you so much
he is small and he doesn't understand he doesn't put questions but my daughter even in the middle of the night if she wakes up she asks where's daddy i miss my daddy and each time i've seen her it's like seeing her father cos they look very much alike
now the family is broke because catalin hasn't yet earned a penny in britain everything rests on passing the test but the examiner is in no rush
right that's the test over just a couple of points that i would like to make with you when you sat at a junction if you want to move away and you put your signal on sometimes we're not in gear first otherwise we're pleased to tell you that you've passed
thank you
bit of pressure off hey
yes yes quite a lot there you go well done thank you very very much
well done you had to do it
it's only a piece of paper but for catalin and his family it's the passport to a new beginning now he can make plans for anna and their two children to join him
i need to call my wife and tell her i've passed and er then relax finally
two years it's a really long time for you
i'm just trying to get used to this job
you have already yeah
jolanta is settling in but she is missing her boyfriend sergei
just maybe there's an inside feeling little lonely
are you missing someone yes there's somebody there is somebody imagine home
the hotel industry is another british business that recruits in eastern europe but that means their staff are a long way from home
ah i have one missed call oh my god list lara yes she phoned me what can i do
early next day in plymouth catalin is getting ready to start work
i never thought i could learn how to iron a shirt i need my wife for this wednesday's my daughter's birthday and er it's the first birthday that i'm missing from away from home it's gonna be tough without my princess
catalin is under enormous pressure he owes his employer seven hundred fifty for the training they provided it'll be a while before his family realise the dream
i'm ready to start work i hope we have a nice day from now on
hello hi mate are you all right just started work now finally no rain
yes in the front will do thank you thanks
so we're going to derriford hospital
derriford hospital please yeah
are you visiting somebody
no i've got an appointment
i hope it goes well
i'm a customer today
well i sure hope it goes well
yes yes don't worry
tonight i'm gonna have myself
this is a good melody when i am bored and i have nothing to do and i just drive put this on a maximum level wonderful i'm floating around in ecstasy so don't stop me now don't stop me cos i'm having a good time
but there's one thing stopping him from really having a good time he's missing his family these days service industries in britain rely on a multi national workforce for sigmund europe is one big country
what is a patriot what is a patriot now when we have one country one europe poland poland is er when you create here good er home then that will be your land that's it
good evening hiya how are you today we are very well
how are you thank you very good do you miss your family
yes to be honest really yeah i hope that i just grow used to it of course i feel homesick and lovesick of course as well it could be not normal if i could not be like this so it's hard yeah emotionally hard when you even can share these feelings with nobody you are coming back home and you are alone you know yeah
in bradford the mussanzis are also missing a loved one and a way of life
i am leaving now see you
in congo ben was a radiographer and kongossi a teacher for her peace work kongossi was nominated for a nobel prize
this is a hard chicken
what is it you do here in bradford kongossi what's your work here
oh for money i do er just few hours of sort of work in the university in the library just to get cash
so what is it you do at the library
i do not like to tell you
why not
it's not easy to get a job here so you can do anything you find just to get money
absolutely yeah
now money is so tight they are moving to a cheaper housing association property
can we go this way yeah
these are the keys to your new property i hope you will enjoy it very very much thank you thank you very much
thank you so much
you can't imagine how we are happy
so you have an older daughter then still in the congo
when you were talking about who will be coming to visit thank you for saying yes because she'll be god willing the first one to come soon in august after seven years of separation so we are struggling struggling if she can get the visa we hope that we'll not be disappointed like two years ago they said we think that you are lying because your parents are in the u. k. and you are saying that you are going for one month we think you are lying and that's the dilemma of refugees nobody can trust you
mapenzi is due to arrive in a month's time
exciting at the same time stressful
and we need some money for all visa process we need some money for her ticket because for getting visa they would like to see the ticket and it have to be a return ticket because if it's not a return ticket they will think that she's coming to stay with us and er they need to know if mapenzi has some money in her own account in the congo so that's very expensive time for us very very expensive so this is english weather isn't it
in plymouth it's not only the weather that's taken a turn for the worse catalin's finding the reality of his new life hard
i'm not here for entertainment i'm not here for fun i'm here to work and i'm here to achieve the goal of bringing my family over and er have them here as soon as possible and um so what can i say i came here to work for them and to provide ourselves a better future and um it's coming true
but for catalin and many like him the dream comes at a high price
so very very difficult believe me
how often do you manage to speak with anna
i spoke to her about four days ago and i'll probably miss my wife's birthday as well so er i've gotta bring them over
the mussanzis know their experience of war and separation is not unique they run workshops to help other refugees
we say there are two sorts of trauma it could be brutal beatings that is physical and it could be also beating morally it's a horrible situation horrible trauma
for ben's daughter sifa the memories are still so raw she finds them difficult to explain in lyme regis jolanta's made a big decision
this is my last shift imagine my last one
jolanta it's the best place in the world here in devon and dorset the english people don't know what it is here i know i'm from poland it's the best he's crazy no i'm not crazy it's my passion for this place
i'm going to my loved onea
she's a city girl i think she's used to more of that sort of thing but here it's a case of you've got the pub the pub the seafront or the pub and that's about it
after maybe two or three months she come back i am sure believe me
i don't regret anything so what i done it's done and that's it and now i search for good job in latvia because lots of people as you know coming abroad to work you can do anything with your heart you know you can put a lot in a career but love always find you so i am going back and i will try to settle down in latvia and then i'll try to find new job to be with my loved ones
despite catalin's long shifts the money isn't rolling in as he expected he too has made a tough decision
in order to put some money aside we have to put in really long hours so because of that i myself had to postpone the arrival of my family in england from er november or early december as i wanted to january because i cannot risk anything so c'est la vie
to keep the dream alive catalin needs to earn more and the only way to do that is to work the dreaded saturday night shift
seeing the city from here seems all peaceful as if everybody's staying home and watching a nice movie and everybody's about to sleep
cos i'm having a good time having a good time
saturdays are the busiest nights in one shift catalin aims to make two hundred fifty see to the left
i'm a racing car passing by like lady godiva i'm gonna go go go there's no stopping me i'm burning through the sky yeah
i will probably be really pissed on half a pint
in lyme regis jolanta's determined to enjoy her last night
i can kiss away the pain i will stand by you forever you can take my breath away you can take my breath away
and finally sergei arrives after only two months jolanta's on her way home to latvia
yes i miss her i really missed her
so you're happy jolanta
yes very happy
i've passed one hundred already i'm about one hundred thirty five one hundred forty if i do today two hundred fifty hmm it would be very nice you know it's nine degrees celsius outside and they're cold
in the taxi control room the calls are coming in thick and fast maybe catalin will make his target
yeah i'll appear in a programme with that voice how long have you been in plymouth for three months oh yeah do you like it here
well there are things i like there are certain things i don't but generally i like the city a lot yes
you like the girls it's by the sea the girls yeah
my wife is more beautiful than any english girl
no ah no there are beautiful english girls though quite a lot of them
there are many but my eyes are open for my wife only that's good that's good
ah i feel so much like going to sleep i don't know how i do it it's just i do it every weekend i want to make five hundred so until my family comes over i cannot afford taking a day off
family can you come we want to ring doctor mapenzi
yep
the mussanzis have received bad news the british authorities have once again refused to let their daughter visit
hello
hello doctor mapenzi
hello dad
i will never leave you alone i will never leave you alone or no forsake you
the british consul wasn't convinced mapenzi would return to africa she can't even visit the u. k. on holiday but in the new europe jolanta is free to follow her heart wherever it leads
jolanta oh no
she may have rejected britain but there are twenty five other states to try
ah thank you bye
you take care look after yourself bye then love have a safe journey
thanks it was nice to meet you

are you sure what were you thinking
caribbean island radio
a big hello to you out there as our transmission starts off in the city caribbean island radio floating across the rooftops gliding over the parks and reaching up to the tower blocks
this is port of spain the capital of trinidad and tobago
caribbean island radio bringing you church music this sunday so let's move from central trinidad and go east we touch down in guiaco a small close knit community and as it's sunday it's a quiet day people relax outside their wooden houses most houses have verandas for shade against the sun while these houses are made of wood the church is built from concrete the building is cared for by mother vera
this is my church where we come to church on sundays the church is the centre of the community everybody comes to church dressed in white the church is painted white for coolness and also for purity the yellow is painted to enhance the beauty of the church let us all go inside welcome to our church you see we don't have a front door because we need the air there's a lot of ventilation we have lots of ventilation blocks that lets the air in keeps the church cool our roof is made from galvanise we painted it blue to keep it cool the design of our church is simple but we consider it home
it's sunday service over at guiaco baptist church there's singing and the congregation is arriving
since i lay my burden down glory glory for my saviour since i lay my burden down
within the church's concrete walls the wooden benches begin to fill up more people arriving means the building will get crowded however the open plan and stone floor will keep the building cool
since i lay my burden down burden down glory glory hallelujah since i lay my burden down
so let's leave the sunday service and pick up in dominica heading north and over to the tree covered mountain peaks where there are trees there is wood timber dominica's most abundant natural resource trees cover most of the island due to the rainfall and fertile soil so timber is put to good use in dominica in the old days most of the houses were made of wood people would build from whatever materials were available locally fine elegant buildings with cool balconies to hang over houses of all shapes and sizes in the past most buildings were made of wood improvements in transport mean that new materials can now be brought in many new buildings are made of concrete buildings are used for many purposes the school buildings are at the heart of the paix bouche community one hundred sixty four children attend paix bouche government school it was built in nineteen sixty two but additional buildings were added in nineteen ninety two
i'm josiane and i'm tarah this is the paix bouche community school in the north east of dominica this is the oldest building in paix bouche behind it is a restaurant and this is where one of our teachers lives
right now i need a drink
hi can i have two fruit punches please sure thank you you're welcome tarah josiane come here please yes ma'am i've left some books at home can you go and get them for me the door should be open yes miss
this is one of the newest houses in paix bouche it's made of concrete and it's also one of our teacher's homes
i've got them let's go
this is one of the oldest buildings in paix bouche it's covered in siding to keep out the rain my grandmother used to have one like this
this is my classroom it's also where the paix bouche school choir will perform tonight ssh
we're listening in to a rehearsal of the school choir just like the pupils sneaking a listen through ventilation blocks it's so warm in the caribbean that the blocks are never covered whether it's the dry or rainy season
because the future of this land lies in our hands give us protection grow us in the right direction when you're gone we are the ones who will carry on it says good luck tonight these holes are meant to keep us cool and bring in light they're also good for passing notes
we're live at paix bouche for this evening's performance the choir is belting out cream of the crop for everyone to enjoy
we're the cream of the crop
we close our transmission with this roof raising music in paix bouche the small school room is bursting at the sides pupils and locals can enjoy special events and performances here
give us protection grow us in the right direction when you are gone we are the ones who will carry on we the young ones are our country's future
as the music starts up again it's time not only to say goodbye to paix bouche but to everyone in the caribbean to those people within these walls and those beyond them caribbean island radio says laters
the fight goes on on great british menu fourteen of the country's top chefs are battling for the chance to prove that britain can produce the finest cutting edge cooking the winners will serve up a glorious banquet in the restaurant at the summit of the iconic gherkin in central london the cooking will have to be superb because hosting that meal will be our leading culinary trailblazer heston blumenthal and his guest list will include leading chefs and gourmets from all over the world wrestling for position in this week's heat to represent the southwest in our final are chris horridge and elisha carter
i'd love to win and go through the more i go through the more i've thought you know what i really really want to win
cooking at the gherkin would be absolutely fantastic no chef could ask anything better
elisha carter and chris horridge both see themselves at the front line of twenty first century british cooking but their styles are so different that they're natural opponents for one another today it's the dessert course and their final chance to perfect their dishes before presenting their menus to the judges tomorrow when we'll learn whether it's elisha or chris who goes on to represent the southwest in the final
today the last day before judgment day is my day
it's important that i get through this i think what i'm doing is part of the future of british food
for his starter course elisha paid homage to the british picnic and served slices of rare white park beef with a very posh oxtail and quail scotch egg chris's cooking is not just about presentation and taste but also nutrition so he began his menu with cured pigeon beetroot seeds sprouts and apricot puree on day two it was the fish course and chris continued his healthy is happy theme with poached ling wild herbs and a sauce which combined liquid amino acids with ginseng while to elisha taste is king whatever the consequence and he served steamed turbot and venison ham with deep fried shrimp and langoustine dumplings yesterday it was the main course and elisha decided to serve roast hogget which is a sheep between one and two years old while chris aimed to give elisha the runaround with roast rabbit carrot puree and summer vegetables now it's time for the dessert course
morning morning alice how are you mate are you all right ah morning
so with that beautiful handbag of yours what are you doing today
i'm doing blackcurrants so that's the main theme summertime so i'm going to make a little soup first there's a few other berries involved in summertime so i've got some blueberries here a few raspberries nice some strawberries and also some wheatgrass i'm going to make a little foam out of that highly nutritious
is that your cream no this is milk this time completely dairy free something i've created myself
people who are lactose intolerant can eat this without any problems at all so it's cow free but it's milk the whole angle is to prove you can have a great tasting dessert without the usual things you would find in a dessert gluten
so chris is completing his healthy menu with a vitamin c. packed summer berry soup as well as blackcurrant mousse and sorbet he's dressing the plate with some wheatgrass foam but elisha thinks chris should relax a little it is the dessert course after all
in my opinion if you're going to have a dessert why not be a devil and have a bit of sugar or cream
wow chris that's so wow that's fantastic
what are you doing you've got cream there four times in a row
i know i know it's great my main thing i'm going to do is strawberries also what i'm going to do is rhubarb
there must be about another hundred ingredients in there elisha you have every day so far
watch i've got some cream and i've got some milk to make like a set jelly like panna cotta
so elisha's offering a whole sweet trolley on one plate first we have strawberries poached in lavender then we have strawberry and rhubarb tapioca strawberry and rhubarb sorbet strawberry and rhubarb jelly and finally set strawberry and rhubarb cream lots of ingredients but chris isn't impressed
glucose and sugar normal sugar caster sugar
it's like looking at the dracula of desserts the dracula of desserts but rather than using london tap water let's use a bit of somerset water and it's fantastic
there's nothing else in the box i don't believe it's gonna be this simple let's just get on and do it eh
ooh ooh here we go
chris horridge gave up a career in the r. a. f. to become a classically trained top chef ten years later he reached his ultimate goal when he became head chef at the prestigious bath priory hotel but he's also pioneered what he calls three dimensional cuisine this means that not only should your food look and taste wonderful but also benefit your health and to help him in this quest he regularly meets up with nutritionist tanya page
tanya specialises in how ingredients work in the body and i pick her brains for that very knowledge on a daily basis
hello hiya how are you all right
tanya has not only had massive influence on the menu at chris's restaurant but was also pivotal in putting together his great british menu dishes including the dessert
you've got basil as well yeah are you still using basil yeah cos that's quite high in magnesium which is a real sort of calming relaxing nutrient
she's highly important and crucial to my work what i'm doing and looking into researching i just couldn't do on my own what do you think i think it's good i think there's some really good combinations
of foods that really complement each other
another important part of his food philosophy is to use natural wild herbs whenever possible
i started foraging quite a long while ago through foraging that's what led me to nutrition the medicinal side that i found by reading lots of books on herbs if there's a medicinal reason maybe it has a flavour and then maybe it can be turned into something that's nice and maybe that's my cuisine there's masses of stuff that's actually edible out there and i'll pick whatever i can find today i'll be picking wild garlic other times i can be taking sap out of trees picking daisies flowers
and though he considers himself a twenty first century chef chris also thinks it's time we all slowed down and returned to nature
it's been lost in time people forget our forefathers would know what was available we've lost all that with supermarkets i don't just throw things in for it to be pretty it goes into the food for a specific reason i use specific ingredients with a nutritional element which is why i do this
back in our kitchen chris finds it hard to reconcile his approach with his rival's cooking
you're like doing lots of different meats or lots of different fish where do you come up with these ideas from
i absolutely love different ingredients and making it come together nicely i think it's my childhood
it's your childhood yeah yeah
elisha carter spent many happy school holidays here in the southwest and has now returned to wow the guests at the exclusive charlton house hotel at shepton mallet in somerset originally from north london he fell in love with the region at a very young age when he used to come here on holiday to exmouth the contrast with the big smoke made such an impact on him that one day it would change his life
it's been so long since i've been here it was really weird i never appreciated food until i come here i come from quite a poor area so fish and chips fresh fish and chips that i was tasting mackerel being caught on the line caught boats when i was a child we wasn't privileged to get that sort of stuff and that was amazing just like first experience of quality food of the southwest
and this love of the local food and relaxed atmosphere obviously did make its mark because when he was offered a good job in the southwest he grabbed it with both hands
for sure it's about the food and the ingredients and all that but it's just the actual way of life which is a fantastic feeling you know there are so many great moments here that i could treasure forever now that i've moved down here i don't regret it at all i think it's amazing fantastic
and great british menu has now given the inner city boy the chance to champion his adopted region
i'm gonna do the southwest proud
back in our kitchen again chris is making the pastry for the base of his mousse ever health conscious though he's found a substitute for the sugar a conventional chef would use
this is xylitol if you eat it you only get twenty five per cent of the available calories from it even it's cooling no it's hard to describe it you go your first impression is it just cools
i prefer icing sugar
as usual elisha isn't impressed
if that's how he wants to perceive things i'm not the only person that uses cream and butter and eggs and if chris's dish is good i won't eat his hat i'll eat my hat
with real double cream or chris's version i wonder in the meantime chris finishes making his pastry vacuum packs it and puts it in the fridge to chill with that done the next thing on his list is to prep the fruit for his berry soup as well as blueberries raspberries and strawberries chris stirs in some xylitol what else white wine and mint leaves all he needs to do now is cover it and let it simmer away across the counter elisha's first job is to make the strawberry and rhubarb jelly so he gets on with slicing and cooking some fruit to make the sauce base as soon as the fruit's poached he adds some basil leaves and allows it to chill once it's cooled and the basil has infused into the liquid he strains it adds some gelatine before pouring it into the moulds and leaves it to set in the fridge but that's just one element in his dessert he needs lots more of the ingredients he's convinced will bring him victory elisha has put a lot of thought into this dish and made sure to study rhubarb before the competition began he wanted to talk to a real expert so he headed off to visit baker's farm near ilminster in somerset he came here to meet his regular supplier john rowswell whose family has tilled this land for generations and who has won many awards for his produce
hello elisha nice to see you how are you getting on oh not too bad the rhubarb absolutely lovely
john had picked plenty of rhubarb in advance and his wife had even stewed some for elisha to try
excellent let's taste some nice
nowadays rhubarb can be grown almost all year round and john took elisha to check out the forced rhubarb he cultivates especially for him
rhubarb wonderful lovely what happens is the rhubarb's dormant it's gone to sleep for the winter to wake it up we dig it up chuck it outside onto the soil and it gets a period of frost cos that breaks the dormancy when it's had that period of frost you bring it into the germination room or a hot room and we just let it grow it grew three inches yesterday amazing
john let's taste the flavour that's yours yeah
cor it does have a nice flavour doesn't it yeah it does yeah
but there is one problem chefs have to think about presentation as well as taste
your wife gave me a fantastic rhubarb and the colour was great i can't have a rhubarb that's this colour i would lose john
what we can do we'll bring it out in the daylight which will turn the colour a little bit more red
how long will it take for it to go a nice red colour
no more than about two weeks i should imagine the flavour's good oh that's good so elisha knew how he wanted his rhubarb to taste
but he also wanted to keep that flavour when he cooked it he thinks that the poaching water can make a real difference and he had a rather special source in mind so he travelled to white hole springs near leigh upon mendip the owner john patch showed him the spring on his land which comes up from deep within the earth
this is around fifteen thousand years old the calcium in the water builds up over the twigs that falls off the trees to form this waterfall you can drink from there it's absolutely pure beautiful water
john you can really taste the minerals can't you that's really good
for me this could be the spring of avalon because the water is so pure and it's so sweet tasting
according to legend the springs once rose near king arthur's final resting place on the isle of avalon but elisha didn't want his rhubarb steeped in history he's a top modern chef and he wanted the water to work some twenty first century magic on his dish
it makes the rhubarb dish taste absolutely fantastic
it's the magic in the water
john has set up a small bottling plant on his land so he was happy to provide elisha with some water to take away with him
there you are elisha thanks john good luck with the competition and you're bound to win because it's magic
thanks john bye see you later
back in the kitchen it's sorbet time for both chefs chris simply combines lemon juice with some of his blackcurrant puree and puts it in the freezer to chill very quick which means he's got time to tease elisha
what is the water doing for the dish
one minute please one minute
i think elisha's more interested in getting his sorbet into the freezer too rather than playing mouse to chris's cat not much fun for chris though but elisha's soon back and he's very polite
sorry chris what were you saying
what's the water doing for your sorbet it's putting the magic into the dish that's the winning ingredient
that's going to make it the winning dish
still to come chris gets all technical as he tries to extract the ultimate flavour and both chefs are finally given the chance to taste and comment on each other's dishes elisha wants to infuse his strawberries with lavender so he's making a little bag to go in with them alongside the lavender poached strawberries elisha's serving strawberries and rhubarb tapioca sorbet jelly and cream and he's convinced he's on to a winner
great combination strawberries rhubarb tapioca no one uses it and it's great for the summer
maybe this is his piece de resistance and showing confidence he's certainly very happy with his dessert so maybe this is it we'll see
for his part chris is creating a vitamin packed summer berry soup as well as low fat dairy free blackcurrant mousse and sorbet finally he's dressing the plate with some wheat grass foam
so chris why did you choose this dish
i'm surprised you keep asking me why i choose this dish why not because basically this fits in with my concept of my food and the reason why i picked blackcurrants you don't get them anywhere else in the world actually it really is an english it really is a very english fruit and it is really high in anti oxidants
well you did ask elisha he should know by now that every ingredient in chris's three dimensional cuisine will be there for some scientific reason
what's that what's all this about
that's my secret ingredient what's your secret ingredient this is straight out of a lab it is called a rotary evaporator i know about this because of the people i liaise with at the universities
chris is so keen to get the best out of his food he regularly swaps kitchen whites for a white coat in the science labs at the university of bath so once his nutritionist tanya had given chris her approval for his dessert his next quest was to extract the ultimate flavour he enlisted the expert help of chemist doctor john fosse and his magnificent spinning machines
hi john how's things hi chris nice to see you again we're going to chop up some fruits and put them into these flasks this must be the first time you've had a chopping board like this in your lab we're using raspberries but this would work with blackcurrants
i think you could use any fruit it just depends on the amount of oils you can extract from them we're just going to try and get the most volatile aromas out here we have got the raspberries i'm going to clip them onto here and what i'm going to do in a minute is apply a vacuum all the volatile compounds which we can smell we're going to suck some of those out we are going to cool them so that they will freeze onto this cold finger and then we will be able to take those into a jar and perhaps add those to your dish so add some liquid nitrogen
willie wonka might have this in his chocolate factory look at that you can see here on the tip of the cold finger
there is already some material which is freezing that's the flavour
the flavour's just there flavour or aroma yes this is great this is exactly what i'm talking about
here are raspberry extracts
that is absolutely amazing if i can reproduce that in the kitchen that's going to be fantastic
a little obviously goes a long way all that chris had to do now was to make it work for the competition back in the kitchen he shows off his new kitchen gadget
i'm going to stuff this straight under your nose get it in one nostril and it is like wow real blackcurrants that's perfect the future of food what do you reckon it's all in the tasting exactly shall we crack on
it's time for chris to make his mousse and once he's added the magic drops to the blackcurrant puree he stirs in some powdered cocoa butter and then pours the mixture over the egg yolks and xylitol all that's left is to whisk it into a light mousse and pour it into the moulds
so elisha what's modern about strawberries and rhubarb tell me all about it
it's the strawberries the rhubarb the tapioca
tapioca nobody uses tapioca these days do they no you're right actually so again i'm right yes you are
well that's cheered elisha up and he gets on with mixing the tapioca with his rhubarb and strawberry puree
it's nice to see it coming back again we're bringing old stuff bringing it back and it's the happening thing of my dish
so elisha modern tapioca tell me what this is about mate
i'm going to wait to taste it altogether chris
when i started at bath priory i did a dish with frog's legs and tapioca and it was a great seller frogs legs and frogspawn that's what it looks like yes
elisha's obviously too young to know we called it that at primary school but chris is now absorbed in finishing off the berry soup and simply leaves the juice on the side to strain through muslin his next big thing is the wheatgrass foam first he gently heats up some apple juice his secret milk substitute and yet more xylitol then he blitzes it with freshly cut wheat grass the last major element in elisha's dish is the strawberry and rhubarb cream it's obvious that unlike chris he's not interested in his diners' health decadent taste and luxurious flavours are his idea of good food but that doesn't mean he isn't curious sometimes
what are you doing chris
flower paper for my dessert basically i'm doing a line like this flower paper flower paper yes this is a fruit puree apricot puree
where's the flour in it oh flowers flowers paper flowers paper you're quite clever aren't you chris
but elisha can be clever too he's decorating his plate with rhubarb crisps the trick is to poach thin strips before putting them on a silicon sheet to bake it's easy when you know how the final couple of things chris needs to do is bake the biscuits for the mousse and hollow out some vanilla pods which he's going to use as vanilla flavoured straws for the fruit soup so with most of the cooking done the two chefs can begin putting their desserts together like his earlier dishes chris has chosen to serve his dessert on a tile and first on is a typical chris streak of blackcurrant jus next he pours the berry soup into chilled kilner jars and gives the vanilla straws a final check the flower paper looks very pretty all that's left now is the mousse sorbet a sprinkling of xylitol and some wheatgrass foam elisha's chosen to serve his dessert in glass bowls first to be plated up is the rhubarb and strawberry tapioca then poached rhubarb and lavender strawberries next the set cream careful then it's time to see if the jelly's set or not it's looking good finally the sorbet and a dressing of nuts parsley and sorrel
ready ready let's go mate come on
calm down calm down come on
all that's needed now is the rhubarb crisp
looks good as well has to be said
and elisha's dessert is complete
alright chris there you go mate yours looks good chris i must say
you said that if i pull this off you would eat your hat look what i've got do you want some xylitol with that
here are the south west region's entries for the dessert course chris horridge's berry soup with blackcurrant sorbet and mousse and elisha carter's lavender strawberries with rhubarb and strawberry tapioca sorbet jelly and cream it's time for the tasting elisha tries his rhubarb and strawberry creation in the kitchen while chris takes his plate into a private room so he can say what he really thinks
it is quite nice actually i think he has pulled it out for the dessert definitely if it's as tasty as it looks then he's onto a winner
wow chris actually seems impressed so how does it taste
i'm going to try the tapioca first because this is bit i'm most suspicious about i like the sort of raw rice type effect going on in there you can clearly see that it's not been evenly cooked
but what does elisha think
i like the texture of the tapioca with the strawberries and the rhubarb it's nice very nice
no agreement there then what about the sorbet i'm amazed actually
i expected that to be really in your face fresh and this is not just me saying don't eat sugar this is very very sweet really silly sweet there's no clean flavour going through the food
is it too sweet for elisha
there's a nice freshness to the sorbet i think there's enough sugar
and the rhubarb and strawberry cream
he's done a really good job of that it has to be said
and finally the jelly
the jelly's actually surprisingly nice
even more surprisingly elisha disagrees
a bit more flavour i think it does need a bit more flavour
so a final comment from chris
this is probably his most modern dish that he's done i reckon cutting edge maybe lacking in that little bit of an area but if he gets it right tomorrow i'm going to have to watch myself
a bit of respect from chris now it's time for elisha to taste his rival's berry soup and blackcurrant dessert so what does he think
the two flowers look very good really nice very inventive
this signifies everything i've been banging on about for the last four days but how does it taste
it's nice i'm speechless
it's quite intense isn't it
it's nice very nice
fruity a little bit of bite to it and it starts to dissolve in your mouth
elisha seems so impressed he's actually lost for words
it's very nice that's all i can say
it will be interesting if he says something that is lacking in flavour i think you'd find it very difficult to say that honestly i don't think i really need to change anything i've got no comments it's nice
it's better than mine i'm just worried now because he's done a good dessert
so elisha's game plan seems to be to spoil the judges and showcase as many fine local ingredients as he can on each plate while chris is out to prove that his tasty healthy three dimensional cuisine is a better way to go what the judges will think is another thing altogether
you're being unkind you're right because i'm expecting more
and finally how do the chefs feel before the big day
i'm not expecting to sail this one i think it's going to be quite tough tomorrow
there's a fire in my belly and i'm going to really step it up and look forward to the challenge
we will find out who triumphs tomorrow on great british menu
tell me what to do to get my life back last thing i remember is this man what man the guy with the horn rimmed glasses
and today here comes the judge order order calm down for heaven's sake cameraman john gets a little bit soppy
it's got white eyelids when it blinks and it blinks and bobs at the same time
whilst chris reminds me of his authority i don't think that's going to be long enough
back off man i'm a scientist
it's a beautiful surface though cos it's black with the white flecks of foam on it it looks like stars
oh you are romantic
look down here i thought that was pollution no it's just foam from the from the air being beaten into the water at the rapids
i'm listening you're listening there's a patch of small thistles over there
thistles those are knapweed i'll have you know knapweed you're good on your sound but you're crap on the flowers aren't you
there's a patch of knapweed over there that's better and what i want to do is plant these microphones in amongst the knapweed
i don't think that's going to be long enough
back off man i'm a scientist
bit of patience required
but what a great way to spend some time sounds like hoverfly
noise pollution yeah as well as microphones i want to start bringing out with me a few surface to air missiles
yes yes i think that's it
so when i'm not recording i can amuse myself in other ways
he's only joking i think anyway here we go with the coat hanger on a pole method searching for sounds and it's not going terribly well because some of these creatures are very quiet was that all right it wasn't great i can't hear that i can't hear anything
can you hear that no
well what i'd like you to do is put your hand in there no drop this i've arranged these look i've made them look a bit wasp like
giant wasps perched on a coat hanger so just sort of hang it in there good that's absolutely amazing
there are pitch changes there are that's what i'm hearing
bee wasp flat
bee wasp flat can't take anything seriously i don't know now they've gone quiet
hang on listen listen
there's some creaking and stuff sounds like water i think they're repairing the nest
d'you hear that cos it's a papery sound yeah can you hear that
it is fantastic i've never heard that
the sound of wasps chomping making paper for the nest you heard it here first yes the sound of a nest of wasps or is it a swarm of wasps well officially it's a pladge of wasps a pladge collective nouns there's masses of them in wildlife particularly birds i mean whenever many birds are gathered together at one time we never just say oh look there's a lot of birds we say there's a flock of birds although it's the ones that are a bit more imaginative that are the most fun things like a charm of goldfinches a gaggle of geese more like honking to me anyway i'm here today to check out the validity of one of the best known of all the collective nouns trees full of rooks called of course a rookery but also referred to as a parliament of rooks so what did they do to deserve that
rooks c. a. w.
they may not exactly look like politicians but they certainly behave like them and they sound like them too no idea what they're talking about shame hear hear
rooks c. a. w.
and is it the lords or the commons yeah definitely common don't you think i'm mean if they were in the lords they'd be asleep wouldn't they as it happens the older more experienced birds get the nests right in the middle of the colony and the newer birds are all round the outside so it's as if that lot are the ministers and that lot are the backbenchers and which one's the prime minister oh ho yeah he looks pretty full of himself doesn't he oh yes a lot of deceit and sneaky thievery nicking one another's sticks oh and i suspect nicking one another's wives or girlfriends so a parliament of rooks they might be a little bit insulted by calling them that maybe they need a name change well they're going to have to vote on it gentlemen and ladies the motion before the house is that we change our collective name from parliament to to to something else so all those in favour say aye rooks c. a. w. no no no order order calm down order order for heaven's sake all right you're a rookery what d'you mean that's penguins but enough of this whimsy i wonder if john's having any luck with the dippers lucky dipper ah ha maybe
this is a surprise there are two pools here full of newts it's like seeing little crocodiles crawling in the bottom of the pond
it's like looking down and seeing newts actually and they're not birds john so what other birds would i expect to see in a place like this
there's a grey wagtail beautiful this is a good place because when water falls over the falls and comes down it means that i can come down lower than the upper part of the river so this camera's looking across the water surface at pretty much the eyelevel of a dipper i hope if the dipper comes up there it'll be a nice low perspective i can hear something it's a young dipper on the other side of the river it's just a baby and it's bobbing like they do which is probably camouflage of some sort it's really sweet it's got white eyelids when it blinks maybe that's camouflage too like splashing water and it blinks and bobs at the same time really nice creamy under here i love it oh there's another one they're together and it's sweet two of them right beside each other they're really beginners they must just be out of the nest just a few days i think and they really don't know quite what to do about food i mean they're they're having a go they look a bit interested in the water it's just pecking at everything that it sees it's picking up moss little bits of wood the adults must be close by oh here she comes it's one of the adults it's probably the mum they swim down they fly down really to the bottom hold themselves there with their wings and find insects on the bottom of the river their feathers are really important to them cos they have to be waterproof much more waterproof than most birds would i think
it's feed feed feed
she's got to decide cos they're both calling and she's only got one mouthful of food so she has to decide who to give it to
that is truly delightful i could take a bit more of that but later first a question for you what animal would you like to see re introduced into the british countryside er
i'm trying to think now did the dodo ever live in britain no
well i don't know only that they're extinct
it's not the squirrel tiger is it some kind of large gorilla
a wild boar no bear bear probably bears
well wild boar are out there and not just in sausages but there's one animal that nobody mentioned there and to see them i'd have to go back many many years walking through a forest like this is surprisingly ominous ooh that's a spooky noise isn't it that was me i knew that was me there must be some wildlife in here there's something been digging wild boar i don't think wild boar fell trees teeth marks blimey the only animal i know that does stuff like this has been extinct in britain for a couple of hundred years water fallen trees chomp chomp chomp with big sharp teeth yes i know i know i know everybody's sitting at home shouting beavers course you are just like the ones we saw on autumnwatch actually not just like the ones we saw on autumnwatch because the ones at martin mere are in a little enclosure with small ponds but i am up in scotland at a place called aigas on a huge estate with a great big loch this is the time of the evening i know i ought to give up if i'm bird watching cos i'll start hallucinating leaves and rocks start turning into birds and logs start turning into beavers at the moment it's having a little look around to make sure that there's no bears or wolves or anything like that which there aren't by the way he's having a bit of a nibble the question is what's he doing here obviously he didn't get here of his own accord he was brought here by a man with a vision and the man is john lister kaye thank you for plunging me into beaver habitat john i don't think i've got the legs for this really but still
this is all exciting stuff i know it is
where did you get the beavers from in the first place though
these are bavarian beavers bill they were imported to england to a wildlife park and then from there to here
i'll tell you john you know i'd seen pictures of this i've seen it in comics you know beaver's been at it but i mean this is amazing it's like a giant pencil
the beaver is a bark feeder and to access the bark it's got to fell the tree cos it can't climb cos it can't climb
simple as that it's just food i thought they were vandals but they're not
now every now and again it goes wrong and beavers kill themselves by felling trees onto themselves or onto their mate but that of course only happens very occasionally yeah
how long would it take to bring down a tree
i mean it's a big animal i often say think spaniel yeah it's that sort of size
and it has these hugely impressive incisor teeth certainly are
i'm another beaver here john offering your beaver this stick go on let's have a go
he'll hold it in his front paws like that and just nibble nibble nibble nibble nibble nibble removing all the bark all the way round
have a go on this bit there's still bark there go on
i'm not sure i'm equal to this you're not strong enough i didn't cement me dentures in this morning you see
that's it you see you're getting there
well i suppose it must happen to them occasionally that's a visit to the dentist john i've got some news for you i've got some news for you and this might come as a bit of a shock but i think this one's past it anyway yes it has to be said not everyone is so enchanted by nibbling on this kind of scale cos let's face it it does have quite an effect but is it destructive in any way that's a naughty d. word i know
you have to see the big picture ecologically speaking it's a very positive impact the beaver lowers the canopy around its water body
yeah and then hugely increases bio diversity
lots more dead wood which is very good for invertebrates which is wonderful fish food it benefits newts toads frogs small birds hugely benefits all the insectivorous birds you would get in a wetland wood
so they're managing the forest or managing this sort of area
absolutely i mean look at this one here that was felled a year ago and we've got one two three four five at least six new stems yeah absolutely
it's pruning really isn't it it's just like gardening they're pruners he goes out and mows the lawn next right
messing about on the river that's right i bags be ratty he can be mole
oh ratty what a fine day to be rowing on the lake do you think our old friend the beaver might see us at some point
well you just never know your luck do you
john in longer term what's your hopes for the future of the beaver in scotland
bill what i would love to see is the official reintroduction of the beaver right across scotland the highlands and the lowlands we know it's so beneficial for wildlife all the science is there we hunted him out i think we need to see mr. beaver back in scotland
she's got a fish it's amazing i didn't know they caught fish at all and she's whacking it like a kingfisher would to try and knock it out it's caught a catkin but it clearly thinks it's something to eat
ten stone rocky guards his owner like a thuggish jealous boyfriend
rocky got him you'd think butter wouldn't melt watching you walk like this
and bis is a kelpie who scares the life out of his owners
no he's controlling us we're not controlling him
it's time for extreme measures this is the last resort for bad dogs set up on a ten acre compound in a remote part of english countryside dog borstal is run by three of britain's toughest trainers
your dog is a dog it is not your child move your arse it's the size of the problem not the dog
but to reform bad dogs they need to tackle their owners for these three dogs the freedom to behave badly is about to come to an end rocky and alesia have been together for two years ten months and nineteen days it should have been a match made in heaven once upon a time rocky had the body of a prize fighter but in the last few months he's started to let himself go he's fat he's greedy and he's lazy
one two get in
he's developed a jealous streak rocky is determined that no one will get their hands on his bitch he sees all men on the streets of sunderland as potential sexual predators and that includes pensioners
no you'd think butter wouldn't melt watching you walk like this but when he acts like that you can't enjoy him
having seen off the competition outdoors rocky's doing all he can to cramp alesia's style indoors
one evening after i'd been out i came back with the guy i was seeing when he saw me come in the house he ran up the stairs and he sat upstairs on the landing on guard so that nobody could go upstairs just the two of us i wouldn't like to be without him but i can't go on like this
alesia wants her life back so she's sending rocky to dog borstal and he's about to meet his match his trainer this week will be ex cop mic martin he gets results through discipline so rocky is in for a tough week
watch your head
he's a big dog just have a little look dog in good shout
this will be rocky's home for the next four days
tell him to wait there you wait
good boy he'll be all right i'm sure he will
people have preconceived ideas about rotties if you see that big fat running towards you you're gonna your pants owners of dogs like that need more control than anybody else that's why i'm gonna be hard on her
the final arrival at dog borstal is a category a offender australian kelpie bis is not your average dog devoted owners andy and mel adore the addition to their family
i'll battle in his corner like he is my child he's part of the family
he has got a lovely nature but every so often it changes
and bis can turn like a dog possessed
the eyes change demon dog
as in all good horror movies it happens when least expected
if he's really wound up he throws a wobbler if you put the lead on
no no
he's bullied andy into submission and now only mel can handle him even he's finding it hard
thank you no no
this may be their baby but he can be the devil incarnate
no no no stop
he's controlling us and we're not controlling him at the moment
it's not as bad as some we've had
they've tried everything but andy and mel are running out of options
we want to sort him so he's a bit more of a social person
bis is heading to borstal for a last ditch attempt at redemption he's about to go head to head with dog trainer robert alleyne an expert in dog behaviour with twenty years' experience he specialises in the mad bad and dangerous to know
i understand he's a bit of a delinquent he bites a lot and doesn't like to be told what to do he takes it very badly well he's in for a bit of a shock this week i'm the daddy this week
it's straight to the kennel block for bad boy bis
is this all of his stuff yeah
andy and mel have brought bis a few home comforts
it's a kennel in a bag what will they think of next they think of this dog as their child they adore him andy said it was awful to see bis in kennels bis is really sad his face is really sad he was just anthropomorphising and treating this dog like a child and it's not
with the dogs safely locked up the owners can finally settle into their barracks while the others relax alesia has to complete mic's homework at borstal everything runs to a tight schedule and before lights out all dogs must be taken on a mile long walk
rocky and bis are about to face their toughest week ever rocky is charged with throwing his weight around
she can't physically overpower this dog it's too big too heavy and too stupid
and bis has been committed to borstal for gbh
a really hard one it's possible we'll fail go on pull him over
can these dogs be turned around or are they beyond redemption
you're not gonna win
there's no time for lie ins at borstal ten stone rocky is heading for his first class
out
trainer mic wants to see just how fit this fat boy really is
hup
it's gonna be hard work now go for it just run ready
bang a gong get it on rocky
he's gonna definitely get over that jump come on you
hup hup
mic's used to getting results but with this fat rottie he's getting nowhere
he's unfit and doesn't like exercise he's grown to despise the exercise he needs for his survival
heel
bis and his owners haven't even started training yet but robert already has serious concerns
initially robert just wants bis to sit and allow andy to stroke him
good boy that's a good boy
that's it
we're not acknowledging that keep going don't stop stroking he doesn't like hands running down his body we're saying we don't care you'll put up with this keep stroking don't move your hand he can't touch you he's saying get your hand off me as soon as you move that hand he thinks you did what i told you
forcing bis to respond to basic commands reinforces the idea that his owner is the boss
that's good andrew that's good he's not a dog that hates being touched he just wants to control the touching work it up into a state if you want to nothing's going to change
but bis and andy have made frustratingly little progress
but i could spend the whole week just trying to get this dog to sit a really hard one it's possible we'll fail
lunchtime brings a rest for the dogs and a brief respite for the owners some are finding training tougher than others
we haven't even got him to sit we've done a two hour session for him to try and sit
he hasn't bit youse though no cos he had a muzzle on
he was going at me hammer and tongs we've done a bit of walking but two hours and he wouldn't give up
break over and mic's determined to get rocky on the road to recovery he suspects the secret to getting this greedy boy to jump is to use food as a reward
eat good boy
rocky's starting to get the hang of it mic is full of encouragement
move your lazy arse big elephant good boy i think he's quite enjoying it isn't he hup
good boy
as rocky starts to improve the size of the treat incentive can be reduced
he's got to do more for less
i'm on my way i don't know where i'm going i'm on my way good boy that's a monster isn't it good boy we'll make an agile dog out of you yet
i was surprised to see it even go over one bar let alone five feet that's amazing there was no way he was gonna get over five feet yesterday
mic decides it's time to raise the bar
hup shall i do it again do it again
this is where the fitness shows do half an hour and he can crack it do forty minutes and he's knackered ready ready hup hup
unfit rocky has nothing left in the tank
come on then come on hup
go on ah you clonk
having made little progress this morning it's right back to square one for bad dog bis
no sit and what he has to learn is good boy doesn't mean he can lie down sit come on sit good
and straight back good you nearly made it then
for andy it's becoming a battle of wills
sit keep that left hand there keep it there that's the way
are you all right
i think it's just getting a bit much for him now the frustration's coming out of andy now he realises the extent to which this dog is prepared to go you're absolutely right it's such a simple exercise but he thinks he can win it sit
come on sit sit
you don't want to but tell him he's a good boy good boy
bad dogs rocky and bis are serving time at borstal there's only one day of training left before they will have to prove that they have reformed the pressure's on to start showing some serious improvement bad boy rocky may be shaping up but he's still got a lot to learn mic wants to demonstrate that controlling a large dog like rocky doesn't have to be about force
all he needs to know is that when we change direction he stays with us so when we're walking like this if i stop stop don't think about anything else so when you walk down the street if he goes too far in front we're going this way what happens then in a short time is he decides he needs to follow me around and stop when i stop but will alesia master mic's technique just turn just drop it and go go you don't have to use your strength he's walking all right i can't believe he's walking without his haltie pulling us all over he's picking it up really well and it's got to be said that the handler's doing very well so um they're becoming more of a team
good boy having spent all yesterday learning to sit
the next stage for bis is to walk to heel
his tail goes right under him you know he's not happy
with so much at stake andy is determined to crack it
leave come on leave sit mentally he's still wound up
just take your time do a bit of a time out sit for a while then move off walk on
heel sit that was all right was it only all right
i thought it was a bit better it was all right
robert needs to find out how bis will react to andy when his muzzle is off
keep holding his collar he's got a strop on sit there's nothing he can do good that's perfect andrew now when you're happy he's calm take your left hand off his bum and stand up straight if he goes to jump up lift him up i'm not having it good that's really good for andrew because we know he's nervous
yeah so that can't be easy for him to do
i'm really proud of him there he kept that hand on the bum we kept saying it sit good good excellent andrew hold him up just hold him up mouth still open when you put him down he's still going to strop take your time take your time
got him calm that's it
for andy and mel it's a disastrous end to their training
i thought we had a little bit better behaved dog than we've got
we spent two hours just trying to get him to sit you have to keep going or else you'd put him to
tomorrow all dogs face the test but before they can bed down they are taken for a final walk and the whole camp rallies to support andy and mel
i would never have picked that dog in a million years it ain't a family pet it's a working machine my girl's over the moon you know you do feel a bit sorry for him
it's the day of reckoning at dog borstal the test today will be marked by a tough independent assessor ryan o'meara is an expert dog trainer his word is final in deciding who will graduate nerves are running high in the kennel block but before the test starts andy and mel are called to an emergency meeting
unusual seeing rob without the dog
i decided we wouldn't do a test i think it would be um irresponsible of me to set them a test that was easy enough for them to pass and let them think he's fine cos he's not and he won't be for a very long time
it's been a hard week but some progress has been made
for you the defining moment was when you stood there and shouted you are not going to win that was a real turning point that's the first time i saw in you the real belief that you were going to beat this dog and he lost it isn't something bis is used to i don't think he is a bad dog he's a misguided dog but he just needs pointing in the right direction the more he gets the quicker he'll progress i've said to them i intend to keep in touch and they should view this as a long term programme no short term cures happening here
we haven't got the dog as far as we'd like to but on andrew's side he's got more confidence and he's more relaxed with the dog that will help to get him further now
bis is leaving dog borstal on probation
the question today isn't really if she passes this test it's she passes because she will
but alesia is not so confident
today rocky's gone back to being a bit jumpy and playful kind of behaviour i need to be more strong with him today otherwise he's going to knack up the test
a week ago ten stone rottweiler rocky guarded his owner like a jealous boyfriend but after intensive training has fat rocky shaped up enough to pass
wait wait hup good boy good boy hup good boy good boy hup good boy hup good boy hup good boy hup good boy hup good boy
so far so good but rocky is about to go head to head with four other dogs all mic can do is watch and wait heel
theme from rocky heel heel heel good boy good boy heel good boy
good boy good boy
good boy sit good boy good boy

what happened i was at my gran's last night
and guess what she slipped over and hurt her leg just here she was on the floor and couldn't get up oh dear poor gran
what did you do gran told me to go to the phone which is downstairs
and ring nine hundred ninety nine which i did
well done then what did you do a lady asked me questions
then men in an ambulance came and took us to the hospital they looked after my gran there she'll be better soon
well done for being brave and sensible that's the right thing to do i know has anyone else had to ring nine hundred ninety nine on the telephone no let's go over there and i'll explain if somebody really has been hurt you should always tell a grown up if you can't find one and it's an emergency push the number nine on the phone three times and wait for someone to answer does anyone know which one is the number nine
i do it's that one well done
so just press nine nine nine yes
yes but only if it's a real emergency they will ask what the emergency is and send people to help can anyone tell me when else we might need to ring nine hundred ninety nine
if you or judy hurt yourself like my gran
or if any of you did too what else
um if the t. v. broke down and we wanted to watch it
no absolutely not milo that is not an emergency an emergency is if something dangerous is happening it's best to find a grown up and let them ring nine hundred ninety nine if there isn't another grown up
like at gran's house that's right
then you must ring nine hundred ninety nine yourself the person on the phone will help yeah nine hundred ninety nine it's fun to play with your friends every day you want to make it last for ever so keep in your head what the tweenies said and we'll all play safe together yes we'll all play safe together nine hundred ninety nine dialling nine hundred ninety nine if someone's ill and you're on your own nine hundred ninety nine dialling nine hundred ninety nine that's the number on your phone if someone is hurt or really unwell and you need help and a person to tell
dial nine hundred ninety nine that's the thing to do and tell someone so they can help you
it's fun to play with your friends every day we'll all play safe together
out on the ocean far away from land out on the ocean far away from land
the night is black and the stars are bright and the sea is dark and deep
but someone i know is safe and snug and they're drifting off to sleep round and round a little boat no bigger than your hand out on the ocean far away from land take the little sail down light the little light this is the way to the garden in the night
to help a truly lovely lady leave the countryside and move closer to the bright city lights
there comes a time when life takes a whole new direction
like retirement age great i hear you say
yes no more work no more deadlines bliss
retreating to the backwaters is not for our buyer she's not ready to throw in the towel
she wants to jump in the deep end
and like the romans immerse herself in city life that is where emperor kristian and simonus maximus come in we'll find her three inspirational properties
and then give her the opportunity to try before she buys
today's buyer is anne miles who lives in this four bedroom detached house in peasedown a village south of bath
anne used to be a secondary school teacher but at the age of fifty eight she has taken early retirement from work for health reasons
now instead of settling down in the countryside anne wants to spend her retirement in the bustling metropolis of bath
and her son andrew is at hand to help her find a dream home
andrew lives in portsmouth but makes visits to mum regularly not least because she lets him keep his beloved car in her garage
in her spare time anne loves reading and she's also a bit of a social butterfly and is ready to live it up in the city your accent isn't quite bath is it
no it's from the north county durham aye canny lass man
so you both think we're house hunting in bath while i think we are house hunting in barth is that what's going on could be i do tend to say barth
and you have to kind of make yourself understood at times
this move but it's not for both is it
no just for me you're here for moral support
moral support and back up and why are you moving
i have a heart problem and i find it difficult to drive very far particularly at night so i would rather be closer to the amenities of bath
andrew obviously you know your mum's taste what do you think she's actually looking for
something a little bit smaller probably something that is going to be low maintenance and that she can move into straightaway
not a diy person
no absolutely fair enough
are we talking ideally a house apartment
a house i think because i do like to be outside if at all possible but i'm very open minded
andrew is she open minded i think so
you're being very polite you have to
mum's the word isn't it
what about particulars how many bedrooms reception rooms large kitchen
large kitchen would be a lovely basically i can manage with three bedrooms i've got four bedrooms i could manage with two if they were doubles i've an office upstairs i'd like to carry on with the computer work i do have matching furniture i would be worried about not being able to use the dining room table etc
you would like to keep the dining room table
if possible get it on the list
top of the list that mate and we also i presume want room for andrew so he can come and visit
that would be nice
are we comfortable looking in the environs just around bath as long as it's easy access
as long as it's easy access there are park and ride schemes right
that brings us to the crunch point
kristian it is a glorious sunny day and anne is so lovely i want to pull out all the stops andrew's keeping an eye on us
we will pull all the stops out here's my famed nostradamus impression i predict that we are going to struggle with that budget
you are a bringer of doom and gloom i am right you are right two hundred fifty thousand in the glorious city of bath it is going to be tricky but if i know anyone who can do it i know two fellas who can
they're not available we have to do it
yeah we will right bath here we come
barth
the historic city of bath boasts some of the finest property in the country it's world famous for its roman baths and the temple built around natural hot springs
the romans arrived towards the end of the first century ad and they loved it so much their away day lasted for the next three hundred fifty years
they liked nothing better than a naked dip in the hot baths which are fed by three hot springs rising at a rate of two hundred forty thousand gallons a day
this water believed to be a cure for many afflictions remained popular down the ages particularly among the english aristocracy during georgian times it was last used for bathing in nineteen seventy six but that's not all bath is famous for its georgian architecture using honey coloured limestone is quite simply breathtaking if you buy a property in the famous royal crescent today a six bedroom house will set you back three million but are we really surprised it is a beautiful city and a world tourist hotspot but let's see what anne can get for her money around the rest of the country how about this three bedroom detached bungalow in guisborough cleveland it boasts an attractive lounge and kitchen and is ready to move in for the sum of two hundred twenty nine thousand nine hundred fifty
i can feel it in my waters it's going to be good house hunting in bath
now if there is one person who can settle the debate about whether we are in barth or bath it's got to be jane austen herself my dear lady is it barth or bath
right which way is lady luck going to take me
strange nothing at all bet kristian's having a bad day too aha here we go
can i partake in the waters yes
i don't believe this they had just the place in there as well
oh do come up for air close to the city centre good location
are we in barth or are we in bath
we would say barth
oh bollards
do you think it's bath
do you know what this day is going from bad to worse it's like i've been cursed or something i don't know
how cunning is this anne wanted city living and i am taking an open top tour of the city to spot all the prime property hotspots let's make some calls as well how well do i know bath i'm actually getting to know it quite well
i really hope you can help me out i have had such a bad morning a house in the heart of bath for the money i'm talking about
you're not going to get it sir am i dreaming
i'm likely to end up with something about that size aren't i
i've got my hawk vision on my eyes are peeled for any for sale boards this is a beautiful property
after the bad luck i have had this morning you could have saved my life sir
let's hope so
any for sale signs down there
that's brilliant thank you by the way it is bath isn't it
it is bath thank you settled an argument
just because we're enjoying an ice cream please do not think that our mission in bath has been easy with house prices here we nearly pulled the plug on it we certainly did
it nearly had us licked terrible pun
we did find a nice selection of properties i'm pleased with property number one a very modern building it's got the decor i think anne is going to like and also the space that she requires how simple is that
stop talking or it'll melt thank you very much we agreed to disagree on our properties mine is completely different mine is a former weavers' cottage it's closer to bath than kristian's
carry on talking i'm enjoying this too much the wild card the wild card indeed do excuse me what we have done here we have gone for something so unique so exciting but this is bath through and through and we love it
quintessentially royal bath one problem it's not what anne was looking for how controversial is that do you ask there you go while we eat these property one
anne i am really delighted with my choice property one this three bedroom semi detached is a new development a couple of miles from bath it's immaculately designed and has everything anne needs and i'm sure andrew will approve
this is the furthest couple of miles i've heard of don't worry i've got it all covered
well andrew and anne i'm hoping to be teacher's pet with this one property number one is my choice and i think i'm going to get a gold star you wanted a low maintenance property this little one here is ten years old it's in pristine condition andrew what do you think first
quiet location on the corner of the estate here you like it yes what d'you think of the house
quite like it it's sort of the mock bath stone it looks quite interesting
thank you very much don't look so nervous
the house won't bite you i promise now sulis go on say it again sulis wasn't she the goddess of the bath spring water sulis minerva you learn something new every day here's a nice spot here we go headphones on and we can find out what they make of this what's that missing one thing always so prepared aren't you there we go
nice carpet nowhere to put coats
storage for coats simple simple simple we can sort that out
can you yes are you handy like that
i'm very handy it's called a hook
this must be the lounge
it's a good sized room quite a good size
would i get my furniture that i have got at the moment in i think you would
sofas and the coffee table
here's the furniture checklist the sofas are going to fit and so i think is the dining table
i agree
it's a nice garden with no maintenance at all
she didn't notice the greek beauty and the garden gnome you're not a garden gnome
here's the kitchen so it's a kitchen diner
that kitchen's got everything you need to operate a modern day kitchen no more no less it does exactly what you said
you move in you don't have to do anything
where would you put the drier and the dishwasher i would miss the dishwasher
your tumble drier you get a washing machine cum tumble drier in terms of a dishwasher you find out what you're doing on the weekends
i beg your very very pardon
and then into the conservatory again it's quite a substantial conservatory might be able to put the table out here
it's one you could actually live in in the winter as well
there's the boys out in the garden they've finally spotted us very peaceful very nice
and there's no one overlooking
this conservatory is fantastic it gives the feeling of space downstairs the lounge blends brilliantly with the kitchen which blends with the conservatory
the carpet again all the way up the stairs
nice the way it matches isn't it yes
the decor is so spot on she wouldn't have to lift a paintbrush unless she took a watercolouring course
the bathroom it's got a shower good sized bath similar to yours
power shower as well is it oh right
isn't every room a bath room
i just want a bath but then i'm not a very big person so that'll be all right that's nice i think anne is going to give me an a plus for this do you think this is the master bedroom could be so you've got room for a bed i'm thinking of my drawers etc
built in storage let's see the cupboards
they won't mind me taking a quick peek in
having a good old ferret round
and a look out of the window this is quite a big plot
it's nice it's not overlooked from the back of the property as well
that's the road running down there
it's huge look it's huge
another double room that's good it's a fair size yes same view
that's the bedroom that andrew would frequent when he's visiting mother
let's see what he's got to say
it's a good sized room double bed no problem at all getting bedside cabinets either side
i wonder where you'd put all your drawers and wardrobes i suppose it's because i've got so much furniture isn't it
i think this one is built in
she's a tyrant about wardrobes and storage space isn't she
very very important in the house of the size
another wardrobe in here it's a cupboard but it could be used as a wardrobe
very deep wardrobes very deep you walk to the back you find narnia
bedrooms then just two this is the little office
this is a little study room as well
you would have that in there
space for your computer and all your bits and bobs
presumably that would be connected up for internet etc it's plugged in down the bottom
i'm very envious that anne knows all about internet connections and stuff because i am absolutely hopeless
most people have servers you just have servants to do it i do have servants yes
this must be the airing cupboard
i have to look and see if there's much room in it it's huge is it wrong to describe an airing cupboard as voluptuous yes i like the position of the house with the garden trees and the road
do you think it will be handy for getting into town i hope so
i hope i would be able to drive and that there would be park and ride handy
they don't realise how well this house is located
shall we go and tell them think we should
andrew your mother seemed quite happy with the house very happy she had some concerns about the park and ride system it's only a few minutes' walk away the bus will pick up and take her into bath one point seven oh
sounds reasonable can't argue with that
i'm more concerned about you you live on the south coast and visit mum occasionally sure and we've got the bedroom for that you've also got a bit of a project of a car haven't you i have indeed which is an old rover you've had that for about two years and you've been finishing it for
about two years we need to house it yes you're thinking of finding somewhere where i live
what about voila this this is looking very good indeed yes if we just open this up here you will see a home for rover we'll just remove some of the stuff that will all disappear good space yes we have a nice house we've space for your car park and ride for your mum does it get better than this
maintenance free garden very good indeed
anne look at this gorgeous back garden yes it is nice
i like it very much
gets plenty of sunlight as we can see you've got a little space here to sit when you've got your friends around
when we do the book club that'd be lovely on a summer's evening
best of all how this garden has been designed is low maintenance absolutely fantastic it certainly is the cleverest thing is this gravel yes it's on a semi permeable membrane so you won't get weeds pushing through it'll not need weeding it will look after itself and what i like best about it is they were clever enough to use a big enough aggregate if you use stones smaller than this you know what happens no your back garden becomes the local cat litter
oh right i wouldn't like that
but this is fine they've really thought about this whole space we've got the terrace there low maintenance everything's in pots
i like the wall too because that sort of ties in with the house and you feel quite secure with that
and private yes private and secure
and the trees overlooking are gorgeous you see
so we love this space don't we all the work has been done for you at some cost to someone i would imagine so yes so i guess that might be reflected in the price
another ray of sunshine in fact two rays of sunshine
who's going to go first andrew can try first i will have a go
it's hard because i live in a different area but i'd say about two hundred ten thousand for this one
i think probably because it's a nice property in quite a nice location it's probably going to be two hundred twenty five or thereabouts two hundred twenty five
i love you it doesn't leave much room for mine but i know what i would get an a with property two
come on
now if anne and andrew are seduced by my choice they need to bear in mind that that conservatory may get a bit chilly and require heating in the winter anne is retired on a fixed income so she should allow for high heating bills
for my property number two i'm going to show anne and son andrew this charming grade two listed victorian cottage in the village of weston it's truly a couple of miles from the city with three bedrooms two bathrooms it's going to wow them
simon it's gorgeous but where's the parking
it is what do you think quite nice isn't it first impressions it's different and it's nice it's sort of got a bit of character and looks well cared for
yeah andrew looks absolutely lovely very nice old traditional building for bath
nice setting and off the main road very pleasant
miss yes miss i don't want to be a teacher's pet but i don't think simon's done his homework i'm really sorry can i tell you what he's done yes you know you said about your dining table he hasn't giving you any space for that and even though you want to drive into the city he hasn't given you a parking space he hasn't given you that option ah i think he should be demoted i will answer those questions later when i put my hand up in the right place
i think you're going to get detention sneak pop the headphones on and let's see what they make of it
oh very strange and very different isn't it
very much like you simon very strange and very different
but full of character
we shall see
i'm not feeling optimistic you have scuppered this to start with they have walked into that beautiful lounge me they haven't even seen the original fireplace me or the beautiful beam reclaimed from a ship from the eighteen hundreds because you've got them panicking about furniture
nice with the old beam across the top i like the beam
i like the old fashioned cupboards in the side as well wow very olde worlde
i love the fireplace the original features
this is handy you've got lots of places to put ironing boards and umbrellas
umbrellas ironing boards dining tables you can store it all in there
ah kitchen this is nice the way the tiles follow straight through i like that
even though it's over one hundred fifty years old it's been modernised in the last two years there is nothing needs doing no
kitchen's lovely that's been quite recently done i should think where would all my appliances go though
simon in true school tradition in the corner please in the corner sorry about this
i like the cooker very much it's one of those ranges isn't it
it's just going looking at that and a little oven there
very simple well appointed kitchen
i like the tiles the kitchen's lovely isn't it it's a really nice kitchen you could obviously put the table that i have there
this is a really good sign because she is set dressing it she is imagining what she can do how she can make it more attractive
crickly wonky stairs very olde worlde
you struggled with the stairs i don't remember
this has been a child's bedroom judging by the blind
make a nice office there is the office
ha quite a nice wardrobe not too high i could reach it round the corner of the stairs nice the way the doors open they've been done in the same sort of pine as the actual doors
gorgeous big boards in that lovely warm honey coloured pine
yes that's lovely isn't it
i love the upstairs of this property so much really nice
quite small
lovely fireplace lovely fireplace it's nice isn't it
wardrobe here
good size for bits and bobs yup whether you can reach it or not
i would need a stepladder i think
that space has been used very well
this is nice the way the landing's organised feels kind of safe character thick thick walls
anne is right the thick walls it feels permanent
this would be the smallest room wouldn't it
not the largest rooms in history but nice sized room and completely appropriate for this property
there's space for a double bed
now this room would also make a very good office
looking at the stars that would be nice
the way the skylight works it'd be nice over the desk letting the light flood in that's the way i'd have it
aha the bathroom that's very nice isn't it
it's a lovely bathroom
every time i hear a squeaky door i think of your wallet same sound
it's a nice bathroom suite and they've got that kind of shower which i know isn't ideal
ah it's the en suite shower room a double shower i love that basin
this for me absolutely i adore that shower room
i like the house yup i like the character of the house it's different from anything i would have imagined and different from what we have just seen yup
they're enchanted with the charm of the property so they should be it's gorgeous
right andrew come with me kristian digby has really got my goat about this place let's have a look at the parking look parking directly opposite free space very busy time of the day there is parking absolutely i haven't finished yet come with me how far do you think we are from the front door now about twenty or thirty yards correct look would that be two more free car parking spaces
certainly would again at a very busy time of the day let's stroll back
if you look opposite we have single yellow lines that means that every evening and all day sunday you can park there no problem at all it also suggests this road quietens down in the evenings so sitting in the front garden might be a very pleasant experience
sounds lovely i do have to accept mate that i'm afraid there is no garage
so the old rover would have to go but you know what it might inspire you to get it done up and drive it to portsmouth you have got a valid point there
you seem quite pleased with the house
it really is nice it's different it's unusual to find something like it in bath it's lovely simon didn't do so bad not really
he has scrimped and scraped on a few areas like the dining table which you spotted
that's a problem but he has been generous in other areas yes
you wait until you see this back garden it's huge how will i manage it quite simply really i see come back here and survey the full estate dear
it's got new brickwork exactly the reason why your garden's small
i like the kitchen i think it's sympathetically modernised and i could live with this very happily
good now the controversial bit be honest do you think your dining table could squeeze into that corner say no if it won't
it would fit in but it wouldn't look so good with the kitchen because it's a traditional dark wood table
you don't want to hear me saying this but you're going to have to sell some furniture
you're probably right it's always a difficult thing to do but if i'm downsizing and making a move this is the time to do it
this was made for you this house yes i like it
yes i don't know how i'd get furniture up the narrow stairs but that's a problem to solve
that is why we have simon for hard labour
oh right that's free oh that's brilliant
two hundred fifty one andrew you did it again oh yes you should be in the business that was a fantastic guess because this place is actually on the market for fifty short of your total budget two hundred forty nine thousand nine hundred fifty we've got one more property left you can regain some pride mate the wild card it's this way come on
if property two is top of the class then anne and andrew need to accept that downsizing means less space it's inevitable they won't be able to keep all their furniture
now for the wild card our joint choice we are taking anne and andrew to this three bedroomed apartment in a famous bath stone terrace fit for a roman emperor
it's got fantastic views across bath and the property has lots of period features and it's buzzing with city life bang on its doorstep right andrew and anne we're about to survey the wild card the reason it's wild is because when choosing this house we were choosing as if we were house hunting for jane austen herself we are offering you a gorgeous slice of georgian heritage look at this astounding building we're offering you a top floor apartment otherwise known as a penthouse what does the lady think
a little bit taken aback it is a wild card i hadn't been thinking in terms of a flat but very impressive andrew
very close to town for your friends and all the amenities you want yes
very close to town i think you're understating it slightly we are in the centre of bath anne you will be living in the paragon of one of bath's most famous terraces and it is an absolutely fabulous building you will have one other reservation i'm sure top floor don't worry a lift awaits to whisk you up there off you go
go and enjoy it thank you now you said this was about two hundred years old
yeah tell me what did it look like when it was first built like this
lucky seven
no honestly i thought it would be bigger than this
this is the lift simon
oh a place for cloaks
anne's obsessed with places to hang cloaks
yes this is wide i'd get my hall furniture there
absolutely a musical family living here
that's lovely
there's a piano in the hall a piano piano you can't make the word piano any posher can you it sounds ridiculous
this is a nice room
it's a lovely room isn't it
oh the fireplace another nice character fireplace
wow the views are fantastic yes
it's a really nice living room that's a bigger table than mine yeah it would go there
this would be perfect for anne whether they've got the vision to see this gorgeous penthouse is just what she needs
can you say perfect again perfect
the kitchen's smaller a galley kitchen it's workable but small
not a huge kitchen very practical and for anne's needs sufficient
you've got plenty of space for storage and cupboards yes you've got space for your that's a dishwasher
there is so much storage space every inch of space has been well utilised
ah this is the baby's room this could be a study it's bright and it's got that nice outlook
it would be perfect for you absolutely
that nursery would make a fantastic reading room and how appropriate to sit there with the sun pouring in perusing the pages of jane austen's work
whilst over your left shoulder you're glancing across at widdecombe and combe down
waiting for mr. darcy to arrive in time for tea it's all too perfect isn't it
a huge double bed not a bad place for a bedroom actually to be fair either is it yes it's got the best view double windows that's a view to die for that's beautiful
those views are sensational
they certainly are i'd buy the apartment just to look at the views
quite a good sized wardrobe andrew that's all nice and built in yeah plenty of high space and you've got quite a lot of hanging space there too it's quite a big room i'd get all the drawers that i need in
that's a very old fashioned term for an undergarment isn't it drawers
oh let's keep this brief
another good sized bedroom it's a good sized bedroom this would be your room the guest room
you'd have that view which is quite nice because you've got light brick and you've got the trees
there's a lot of wardrobe space it's built in and you could put nicer doors on and make that slightly more attractive and in keeping
it's sensible they've got built in wardrobes but i'd love to treat myself to some nice period pieces of furniture pop those into the rooms and the place would sing
ah a nice double shower a fantastic shower
that's a lovely bathroom actually oh it is a nice bathroom
although it's a small bath i'm not a big person that'd be ideal
it's a good size you've got your bits and bobs to put on the side
a shelf everything's built in i like the tiling a lovely basin
you've got the kitchen and the bathroom on the noisy street side yeah good point whereas the master bedroom and the living area are both on the peaceful side with the gorgeous views
spot on someone's thought this through very well
the only downside would be the lift if it wasn't working or if i felt a bit claustrophobic noise possibly from other flats other people coming in and out late at night when i lead a fairly quiet life really but the beauty of it is the access into town couldn't be better
anne has reservations about this place i'm sure but i love it i love it let's go and make her love it anne i have to tell you i'm completely biased here this apartment i think is just absolutely beautiful but you seem to have some reservations about it
because i've never lived in a flat it's something completely alien in a sense but the views are to die for
the views you're not wrong look at this room here it's the kiddie's room you know what this wants to be it could be my office this is your office slash study once more those gorgeous views
yes it would be lovely
you can't buy the views not at all because we are so high they will never be obscured that's right so that would be yours
so while they're up there in heaven and we're down here in hell and if hell is this attractive i'm happy here very good it's nice apartment living you wouldn't assume there's going to be a garden but here we have it a very nice communal garden
absolutely but for me the exciting thing is the location
right in town as we know and behind the houses in front you've got a lovely street that's the arts and antiques district with lovely tea rooms two minutes to walk there no distance at all she's going to be having a heyday that whole concern about a table she's going to buy so many tables down there she'll have a plethora of them fantastic it's going to be fantastic now question to you do you think she would adapt to apartment living
now then if anne and andrew are elevated by our wild card they do need to bear in mind that this is a leasehold property but there are one hundred years left on the lease they should also check the level of the service charges right our final property the wild card and wild it was guess the price time come on andrew it's two to zero to your mother at the moment it is got to get some pride back here ladies first
because of where the flat is the building it's in it's going to be expensive so i'm going to say two hundred forty nine for this one
well andrew i'm afraid you have gone over the budget good grief but you're in fact closest at last finally it happened well done mate anne what were you doing going so low with the price i know i was thinking the price like jane austen we might persuade you persuasion you see what i was doing ah but no because the price of this property is two hundred forty two thousand five hundred now you've seen three fantastic properties we want you to decide which one you'd like to test drive or as we say try before you buy
but there's been a lot to take in hasn't there so what you need is a bit of a refresher which you will find on our laptop we've loaded images of all three properties so you can have a good browse through and make a decision about which one to test drive anne i'll give that to you because you're the one buying andrew help her make her decision enjoy
very polite we like that whilst they take a good look through that lot what grade will anne give my choice property one this three bedroomed semi detached in sulis meadows it has a low maintenance garden and near the park and ride scheme but will that be enough to sway anne at a price of two hundred nineteen thousand nine hundred fifty
or will anne want to live it up with this apartment in the renowned paragon buildings with three bedrooms inspirational views and a short from town for two hundred forty two thousand five hundred
shall we have a look yes let's have a look at number one nice driveway plenty of room for the car good sized lounge but no space for the table that's right the kitchen on the small side not an huge amount of room for your wardrobes but there was built in space it did have a study which was a plus point
that was my favourite the garden i loved the garden
then property number two my favourite nice garden your favourite would be the fireplace
i loved the period features the bathrooms were fantastic gorgeous they were absolutely to my taste you could have really moved in to that with just a lick of paint
absolutely very nice not much space at the back to be fair no what did you think of the final one the wild card was a wild one
i was quite amazed with that really it was a beautiful flat you could see right across bath big lounge space for the table it would be difficult as to where to keep my car not to mention your car
well andrew and anne i feel like i've gone to the top of the class i've passed with honours you have chosen as the property to test drive my choice property number one now why is it you chaps decided this would be the chosen one
well i thought it would be nearer to the amenities that i know the park and ride is handy the shops there's country walks nearby and the property itself gave me adequate parking so i could bring heavy shopping to the door i really did like the garden andrew would you concur
absolutely i think it's low maintenance for you it's easy for you to park the car unload your bits and bobs from it overall it's a nice new house to move into
whilst i am pleased that you like this property i am galled that you have declared him caesar i really truly am et tu brute
now before you do your test drive we've had our own to buy or not to buy surveyor give this house a thorough going over this is not a legally binding survey
we do recommend anyone buying a house to get a completely legally binding survey done with this house do you know there's not much to say he's come up with points like upstairs there could be more insulation sound insulation that's not a problem anne you will be quietly reading all you will hear andrew is the turn of a leaf sounds good to me
to put this in perspective he noticed a chip on the bathroom sink he noticed the toilet seat needs replacing now a surveyor noticing that kind of minutiae quite frankly you know you've got a building that's in very good shape go in and enjoy your test drive
thank you it's all yours off you go there you go
hi there nice to see you
what he had to say about his relationship with his wife was
they seem engrossed but i hope they're taking in the divine garden have read this one this is the next one
of course look anne's in her element i can't believe it after all that reading they are heading off to the theatre for yet more stimulation
meanwhile andrew's checking out the local sights yet distracted by all the shops
ooh nice pair of shoes
simon they are actually cameras but um easy mistake
what i meant was you're getting snappy
no i'm anxious curtains are down and test drive is over
well anne and andrew i know i speak for both of us here i can't tell you what a fabulous day we've had anne you with your gorgeous northern lilt and all your southern sophistication rolled into one andrew travelling hundreds of miles to help your mother out it's been fantastic
you've done the test drive are you going to barter or are you going to scarper
i think on this occasion we are going to scarper it doesn't quite tick all the boxes good as it is and it has its good points um
we were so nice i didn't want to disappoint you
i didn't want to disappoint you we could break our hearts here
what was it what didn't gel
i think in the end just the size of the rooms really i think i needed something bigger it's the dining table isn't it it is
andrew it buys you more time to do something with that old rover it's about time i finished it i think
because you're both so lovely promise to keep in touch and wherever you end up we want to know
thank you deal absolutely brilliant speak to you soon then see you later bye bye now
do you know what kristian i feel kind of deflated oh we've had this gorgeous gorgeous weather here in the beautiful city of royal bath b. a. a ath bath and somehow we didn't find a perfect place for anne and andrew
which is why you and i would never have made roman trojans why's that we came we saw but we didn't quite conquer but rome was not built in a day and we are not quite defeated if you'd like a hand house hunting then please get in touch
we'll try and find you a legion of gorgeous properties all of which will become your perfect home
i can't open the garage door bliss bliss me with house hah wah wah hah hah simon psst what it's completely empty and the water's lovely are you sure there's no one round absolutely nobody dare you shall we after you splash if it makes any difference it's since bec got back
nobody saw us as far as you know
this is the guy who cheated on you with his wife
you're asking for trouble we want our dad back
we have to make him see what she's really like
did you forget he's the younger brother of one of your best mates
this is serious paul you're one of my students
you're here there's nothing i fear and i know that my heart will go on
all right all right anyone else with any insights they'd like to share clare
in rom coms the lovers just need to get over the thing that's stopping them being together and that's often as simple as a misunderstanding or a case of mistaken identity but is usually a character flaw and mostly that character flaw has to do with how they view the opposite sex and they just need to get over it whereas in a tragic love story the couple love each other right from the start but there's an insurmountable obstacle that prevents them getting together
that is how i know you go on far across the distance
and a massive iceberg
i'll say lovely lecture today professor howard
thanks abby
and i love titanic it's a bit like that other one where they didn't get together close encounters the one on the train where they're both married to other people i mean it's black and white
brief encounter
yeah that's it
i'm fine i just have this headache
oh just a minute come in oh it's you i thought it might be gibbo
are you going
five point three oh's a bit early for a drink isn't it
it's just after the shift we're doing karaoke it should be a good laugh you should come
yeah i'll see how i feel
if you do you've got to sing
i was wondering if we could have that chat
i've got to wrap these
not now just sometime i thought maybe
di moore no that's fine i'll be right down i've got to go a suspect kicking off in one of the interview rooms
abby osborne a proper live one
sorry that dead body they found oh right yeah
me i'm easy i just need my pill prescription renewed
i like your outfit
oh thanks bit of a palaver but got to have something haven't you
yes i suppose so um now
you're a doctor your parents must be made up
i think so but what they really want is grandchildren
get off you've got loads of time how old are you thirty
twenty seven there you are then
few more years to live it up
so are you happy with the pill you're on
yeah it's fine does the job
no problems side effects you feel well
i feel great
normal periods yeah
a doctor my mum wanted me to go to beauty college originally but when i told her i'd got a place at university she was over the moon i said i was doing film studies and anthropology she couldn't believe it
do you just want to pop on the scales for me so how are you finding your course
the film studies bit's all right and the professor in charge professor howard is a bit of a dreamboat himself
oh yeah that's fine
and as for anthropology i didn't even really know what it was before in fact i'm still not completely sure everyone just said it was an easy option and let's be honest i'm not exactly the brain of britain but don't worry i've got a plan
oh yeah reading and revising isn't the only way to get better marks
some people have the brains me i use what i can
come in hi any good with printers
you any good with ribs
why what's wrong what happened
the suspect took a swing at barnesy and while he got out of the way someone elbowed me in the ribs
right let's take a look which side is it
oh that one
if you could just take your jacket off
actually it's probably not really that bad
no you're in pain now your blouse
i don't think that's a good idea jimmi
you're a patient it's not as if i haven't seen it before
that's the point
oh is that where it hurts no you just tickled
jimmi i can't do this now
right look then i'll start we should never have split up there
jimmi it's true you know it we belong together jimmi we split up for a reason
we split up because we gave up
but you can't just ignore the other stuff i can't give you the kids you want
we never properly talked about it
yeah we did
what if i changed my mind
have you
yeah
i've got to go you're not connected what
mind if i join you
sure if you like there were things i had to think about that's all
don't worry about that i usually talk enough for two anyway maybe just sitting here some of your brains will rub off on me you all right
i've been waking up with these headaches
you should see the doctor she's really nice i got my pill prescription off her earlier look who's coming it's professor dreamy hi professor howard good lunch
abby hi hello clare
i was wondering have you got any books on what you were telling us about earlier cos you know in titanic when they're doing this at the front of the ship
she's shameless who no one honestly call me a prude but it shouldn't be allowed
what
students sleeping with their lecturers to get higher grades if it wasn't for patient confidentiality i'd tell the dean
you wouldn't would you they'd probably both get kicked out
good sex for higher grades it's no better than well it's not right come on
it's not doing anybody any harm
well it's not doing anybody any good come in hello it's all right i won't bite i'm doctor bell have we met before
i don't think so clare webster
i feel a bit of a fraud really for the last few weeks i've been getting headaches but it usually eases by lunchtime and then like now i feel fine
is that the only symptom
is it that obvious
i didn't mean it like that
it's all right first year first time away from home lots of firsts
good things
first boyfriend well first proper boyfriend if you know what i mean
and how's that going
it's a bit tricksy
something like that
ah university life first love must be wonderful
some kind of wonderful
sorry
oh nothing it's a film title
oh yeah right erm sorry
you again you make me sound like a stalker i'm just on my way out
i feel we were halfway through a conversation
we're not jimmi we've done all our talking except you should know that i'm going to newcastle tonight after the party to sort out my transfer
sorry
as long as it doesn't sing daisy daisy to you what you know like the computer hal at the end of two thousand one a space odyssey
that's where i've seen you before you were having lunch with abby osborne you doing film studies too how are you enjoying it
i love it we watched titanic today
i never really got titanic
oh no it's terrific it's the perfect tragic love story they cross the boundary and they pay the price or at least jack does so that rose can live
that's so weird i was talking about exactly that at lunchtime really yeah but not the tragic love story crossing boundaries anyway where were we
erm i was wondering if you think my headaches are related in some way to you know sex
oh do you think they are are they always post coital
not that i've noticed i always get them in the mornings but not necessarily after erm
well maybe that's a good thing on the other hand if there's something else in your relationship that's causing you stress
sort of and i have had headaches before in the past around exam times and things like that
well maybe that's it then
stress so when the stress stops
yeah there's just something i need to get on and do
you'll never walk alone
di moore come on down
look after my bags will you jimmi testing one two one two
doctor bell professor jamie howard
oh i've seen you before
have you yeah at lunch
you were you went off you were in the refectory
i was
so professor howard what can i do for you
i grind my teeth i see at night and i was wondering if there's anything that can be done
is it causing a problem is there any pain
it's only a problem to my partner it's very loud weirdly loud it's a slightly scary noise to be honest
you can hear yourself grinding your own teeth
no that's what she told me i sleep through the whole thing so what do you think
well is that the only symptom any aches pains you haven't cracked any teeth
i don't know i don't think so
you should really go and see your dentist but i can take a quick look
i just need to know if you can stop it
the most common treatment is to be fitted with a mouth guard
no that wouldn't work it needs to be something else
i can only tell you what's available
never mind it doesn't matter forget it this was a mistake
kinky mrs. gibbo you're nicked
seriously on behalf of all of us we just want to wish you a fantastic and well deserved retirement oh
i'm sorry about that i don't know what came over me
i haven't been sleeping very much and i'm just a bit stressed out at the moment to be honest there's this thing i have to do and i know i have to do it and i've been putting it off
and the teeth grinding
i think you already know it's not me it's my girlfriend i thought if it was just a matter of her sleeping on her side or taking a pill or something i was hoping for something easy and painless you see she doesn't know she does it right and she's kind of shy
shy it's her first time you know sleeping with someone
i just didn't want to embarrass her that's all i suppose you must have guessed it's a student it's none of my business and i can see you don't approve but it's not like that i love her and she loves me
right so is that what this whole doing the right thing is all about
yeah i suppose i'd better just get on with it thanks for the nudge doctor bell
good day yeah you know what we were talking about at lunch about the lecturer it wasn't him was it
it wouldn't matter if it was but i think he's ending it ah well all for the best
he was on his mobile being put through to the dean's office he's seeing him urgently sounded like he was going to resign what did you say to him
resign oh the poor man i hope she's worth it
so please raise your glasses ladies and gentlemen to sergeant peter gibson cheers cheers gibbo get up here then come on you've got to join in
when the going gets tough by billy ocean
i've got not yet i've got to finish my pint first i've something to tell you i've got something to say i'm gonna put these ribs in motion nothing's gonna stand in my way when the going gets tough the tough get going
hello doctor bell was that your lecturer i told him we'd get seen he said he doesn't care but i do
but not oh he's a lecturer from the anthropology department
yeah
which means the headaches the teeth grinding both stressed it's not you and they're really in love who's in love where's the dean's office i still don't approve of you though clare
doctor bell i need to get to the dean's office i've just come from there i've left the course
because of what i said i don't know what i was talking about
you were right end the stress i already feel better i bet i won't have a headache tomorrow
now i think they're caused by you grinding your teeth i don't grind my teeth it's just a hunch i'm so sorry i know how much you loved film studies
i'm doing history of cinema instead with doctor friedman
i've got to get to the dean's office
why because he's gonna resign because of you oh no the ultimate sacrifice
which way follow me
all we're missing is the icy water and poor immigrants
what titanic come on we're nearly there
you can't leave after that you're a showstopper
i've got to go
come on eva please
i've got to
jamie you don't have to go in there
you tell him i've left the course
you quit film studies you can't
just your course i'm doing history of cinema instead
so i'm no longer your tutor and we can
i'm so glad we caught you in time
would you really have quit sure that's the most romantic thing ever
you did it for me i'd started to think we were in a tragic love story but maybe we're a romantic comedy
full of misunderstandings and mistaken identity
oh guilty but where the best friend makes sense of it all just in time
and the last sequence is a chase
and it all ends happily
all we need now is a cheesy love song
can you switch it off eva eva please wait
you can do whatever you feel
can you switch it off unforgettable that's what you are unforgettable though near or far like a song of love that clings to me how the thought of you does things to me never before has someone been more unforgettable in every way and forever more that's how you'll stay that's why darling it's incredible that someone so unforgettable thinks that i am unforgettable too
that's why darling it's incredible that someone so unforgettable thinks that i am unforgettable too open these doors
are we living together again
i haven't finished with them yet in fact i haven't even started
can i see a doctor
it's my daughter ella she's a runaway
ah no
only you ou ou can make this world seem right
we got company
only you

i'm in central london to be fair a very posh chic part of town now i know the person who lives here is pleased to see me because they've laid out a red carpet everything you see here has been chosen very carefully there are some wonderful design pieces and even this simple bowl has a beautiful shape and fits its space so well there's an obvious professional touch in the decor here i'm not usually big on pink but in this kitchen it works so well i love the mix of periods you've got the huge clock slung above the aga and in a different period completely with this stunning candelabra which takes pride of place on the white ceramic table there's a simplicity to this it's almost less is more now if i tried to toss all these items together to create a fab design it would resemble a jumble sale stall agas are the business and this one's kicking out a fair old heat i imagine that this person will be able to cook up a storm in this which brings me to these little fellows now this is a pie funnel what you do is stick it in the pie pop it in the oven and after about half an hour or so hey presto the perfect pie if you're a professional there's iconic design everywhere this huge lamp arching over the table making the glassware sparkle there's a great dynamic about this apartment everything's punctuated with bold vibrant colours and that tells us a lot about this person they're not afraid to show their true colours now this chair is a real iconic design it first came to light in the late sixties when christine keeler posed naked on it recognise the pose now i know somebody else who posed naked on one of these chairs and it is sir david frost no really and why shouldn't a work place be a fun place i just love this truck converted into a plant holder look it's desperate dan he loves his cow pies don't you just love the little horns and the tail sticking out someone does have an unnatural fondness for pies around here there's every conceivable cookbook here on this shelf so a great interest in food but there are a few that give us a good clue nora's dinners why is my custard lumpy eat up and cakes for fun perfect reading for your yummy mummy look at this bedroom isn't it to die for it's elegant and simple yet cosy and the choice of textiles it's so beautiful i have a feeling this isn't a happy accident you get the sense that design runs in the blood of this person let's take a look at the clues again the pie funnels the bold colours and the iconic design who lives in a house like this david it's over to you
i'm happy if you're happy sir david and you're gonna ask me now what i think yes
all right shall i do it very formally for you what
go on then do you think i think i have no idea apart from pink walls me thinks means it's a lady always a good start
i like that now we've got the whole
i mean having pie funnels means i wouldn't know i thought they were just pepper pots i'm not a great cook but i presume this person thanks anton it's not your turn yet but i presume this person is a dab hand at cookery yes
how did you get that's a pretty good now this is interesting
is it go on then
no listen don't stop me i'm on a roll i'm not convinced this person's a chef i think they're more of a cook you might say to me what's the difference i shall explain the pies obviously are they more of a confectioner and they make i don't know posh pies or something like that they're a specialisation posh pies posh pie maker
yeah posh pies would be a good description
posh pies would be oh all right i'll go with that then interior design seems to be quite important are they an interior designer who also has the whole pie thing going on as well i don't know it's not bad though is it you've got two of her areas of specialisation i don't know it's not bad though is it you've got two of her areas of specialisation catering at the oscars catering at the oscars
i want to know about you naked on that chair yes
yes that's all true it's all true
is it really we did it we did it erm
there was there was in truth a jockstrap involved
but that was on his head
so yummy mummy was mentioned as well
right
so
yeah yeah so presumably it's
someone quite young
what does this person do first i haven't finished yet i'm sitting here looking at you in great admiration no carry on i'm happy for you to continue i think that you've got the two areas
the area to do with food and the area the other area design is she a presenter no all right so she's a designer we've got the food and the designer interior design or interior design objects and food right
design objects and food
those two areas i will give this as a donation to you
you're a lovely generous man and i love your tie
if you try and think this lady comes from a famous family who specialise the head of the family specialised in exactly those two areas food and interior design her father is in this field and now she is independently in this field can you think of the surname ah
what i have no idea conrad no not conrad conrad yes conrad
conran conran conran conran yes that's what i meant terence conran caroline conran they had three or four sons and a daughter and this is the daughter if you don't know the christian name i'll tell you don't tell us because you did get conran with my help
isabelle we could go through all the names
jennifer fifi no not fifi
arabella not arabella
jane not jane these are just some of the names it isn't
the name it is is in fact sophie conran so sophie conran will you come through the keyhole
nearly got there
well they didn't quite manage to get the christian name right
they kind of nearly did my daughter's called isabelle
there you are you see it was in there somewhere amazing
you were psychic clearly i must be but not psychic enough not quite psychic enough of the two passions i mean the the interior design and the food and so on which of them is closest to you
i get quite confused actually one day it's this the next day it's that i'm cooking a lot at the moment i'm doing a new book so i'm in the kitchen all the time
oh really i'm really loving that
then redoing my house doing some other design projects working with dad
and posh pies is that a good description of the pies
i think it's very nice i want to make excellent pies my book's about pies are they unusual in their constitution well i believe that a pie is a culinary equivalent to a hug it's something my mum always used to make it's something that's very nurturing you can put all sorts of wonderful ingredients in there it's in fact where magpie came from a pie is a magpie collects precious things so a pie is from that
from that yeah were these things sort of almost did you almost inherit a duty to do these things food and design in the conran family yeah perhaps
well my mum is a cookery writer so she was always testing recipes with us or writing for the sunday times magazine when i was little we'd go off on these great adventures together down to markets to billingsgate market or salami warehouses where we'd get all these wonderful things and take them home and test them all or she'd be making a wedding cake out of polystyrene and decorating it with all sorts of little animals there was that excitement around that then dad very much worked from home his design studio was part of where we lived so all the people would come into the house the samples for habitat would be around and we'd all test them it was kind of it was all happening around me it was all in the blood or in the brain yeah
what do you feel about erm nutrition in this country we read all this worry about children and obesity are we a less healthy nation than fifty years ago or not
if you read the papers that's what they're saying certainly i was brought up with a vegetable garden and chickens and sheep and pigs all running around and getting eaten and landing up on the table i haven't got a great sweet tooth i don't think you should have pudding every day but i think it's using a variety of fresh ingredients and not relying on ready meals and junk food i think it's common sense really
you've got our chair in the house the christine keeler chair
i certainly have and i'm looking forward to seeing the photograph of you on it you'll have to dig it out we'll get hold of one absolutely
it's great to have you with us it really is this is our way of saying thanks a million thank you it's the through the keyhole key not edible but priceless
fantastic thank you so much great to have you with us
our huge thanks to sophie conran sophie conran there and now let's join lisa at house number two and remember the clues are there as we go through the keyhole
isn't this a fabulous room it's homely it's cosy and it's just full of stuff that i want to pick up and have a proper look at but there's just no time i am getting mixed messages though cos there's a kind of young old vibe going on and this is yoda say hi yoda this corner is covered with well known stars of the silver screen we've got fred astaire marlene dietrich jane fonda brigitte bardot they're all there they are from a long time ago and it wasn't quite what i was expecting but they are relevant there's a great atmosphere in this house definitely a loving atmosphere and a keen interest in music what with the piano and guitar although i would be misleading you if i told you they were important clues however this is a clue i happen to be holding in my hands a script and it's not just any old script it's a hollywood movie script these three clues will help the children's book of stars this clapperboard from the film a hat for the camel but what really caught my eye is this this is from the monte carlo film festival for best actor i don't think i'm giving too much away if i tell you that to win something like this so young in your career is quite special there really is stuff everywhere but what i love actually are the christmas lights and it's not even christmas oh and look a roman day bed from the set of their latest movie perhaps if i was having to guess who this person was i'd probably be quite confused right now i don't think i'm getting a real feel of this person across to you there must be more this is more like it this is what i was expecting to find i could say that this person is something of a collector there's a love of all things aeronautical you can just imagine this person painstakingly building away not gonna touch them by now you're probably thinking that this is a typical young person's bedroom but not every typical young person has a sword from an epic roman movie or another one of these let's take a look at the clues again the wall of fame the hollywood script and the award for best actor who lives in a house like this david it's over to you it's a wrap
oh dear i wish i knew my films better if i knew more about a hat for the camel that would obviously help i think that clapperboard at the end i quickly tried to turn upside down and that i think said a very big new movie newish movie is that a yes so that's probably the biggest clue we've got so we clearly i can't believe this house belongs to a young boy is it someone who possibly lives with his parents
i think the answer to that is it doesn't
right so it belongs to the parents it belongs to the parents
so we're looking for a young he has a flat
a young actor who's touched hollywood and he's acclaimed already and i don't know who it is onto you eh
anton
goodness me erm does this actor act in musicals
pardon i won't trouble you with that one
it's fine er she said an interesting line there lisa she said there must be more is that some sort of iconic line from a film that he starred in i shan't trouble you with that either
well it could be the title of your autobiography for instance there must be more and there is more
it's like a metaphor for my life actually erm does he write music no
i don't think so it's a man yeah yay well done
thank you very much does the music that was erm playing there underscoring lisa relevant to anything was it bleeding love bleeding love
love is it leona lewis
is she simon cowell
you've already got the fact that it's a man or a boy is it somebody who wants to be leona lewis how old do you think this person is
well i thought he was about forty but he lives with his parents' in a part of a flat so if nanny mcphee's anything to go by probably about seventeen or eighteen
that's about right first burst on the scene when he was probably about fifteen in a film about love a british film
oh love actually yes
it's that young lad
oh he's so lovely i've got a seven year old daughter and i want her to marry him i don't know whether he's free
he is at the moment he's eighteen but she's not ready yet no not quite
he was only but a wee lad he's probably grown a bit older now got a bit spotty you know what boys are like how bad would you feel if he is spotty if he comes out everyone'll be like that's sad
he wasn't in polar express was he
he was in what
yeah we know who he is just don't know his name
it's the old problem
it is it's worse as you get older as well
he was the one in the film who set his dad up with claudia schiffer didn't he no yes he did
no he was wasn't he the young lad
liam neeson was his dad but it's not i know liam neeson i know claudia schiffer and i don't know his name that's no use at all
it is in fact thomas sangster thomas sangster for whom thomas brodie sangster to give him his full name i'm not going to ask him to come through the keyhole because he is in fact away on location for his next blockbuster film but before he went i caught up with him here in london and this is what thomas had to say thomas one of the things that caught lisa's eye and everybody else's was the aeronautical theme in the house is that a passion of yours
yeah well i've always loved the idea of flying and things and one day i would like to take my private pilot's licence and go flying have my own airfield with loads of aeroplanes yeah i would love that
that's fantastic then there were the star pictures on the walls we saw brigitte bardot we saw marlene dietrich jane fonda and so on was there any selection process on that did you pick your heroes or heroines or
those are mainly my mother's pictures those are kind of inspirational women she has on the walls that kind of inspire her yeah
oh i see because this is a family home in fact yeah and one of the most fascinating things i read was that you were in prague when you were ten with the family when you decided that you had a passion for acting
yeah yeah it was
why did it come on at that particular moment
they were my mum and my dad and several friends
they both were in the profession
yeah they were doing a piece on edgar allan poe in prague castle itself they were doing this play and me and my sister were backstage helping out with costumes and things and we got to see from the wings what went on and i just thought it looked kind of magical fun and exciting even though i actually hadn't done any theatre i just thought the idea of acting looked quite fun
and one of the things you said somewhere was that you had an unsuccessful audition for harry potter and that was perhaps as it turned out one of the most fortunate things that ever happened to you
yeah i suppose yeah i can't remember what part one went up for now but i remember at the time it was one of the first auditions
ron weasley i think
ron weasley oh right yes i did go up for ron yes then several other parts as well i remember being really annoyed that i didn't get it it was one of my first auditions i went up for i just think it would be amazing to do but i'm glad because it freed me up to do loads of other stuff
you started your own production company at the age of seventeen which is pretty good going
yeah yeah
brodie films brodie films and what are they going to do what have they done they have been working already
yes i set it up less than a year ago so we have only just started going we recently made our first just a short film called a hat for a camel
oh we saw that yeah the clapperboard is from that film
even though it was a small film it felt great really personal yes
what is your ambition what do you want to do with the rest of your life
i think it's great to set a dream and aim go for it and see how far you get really i'd like to continue with the film company and just continue it's a way of if i've got an idea or if anyone in my family's got an idea you can just put it into the film company and make something out of it i like that idea a lot i've got several ideas already going at the moment so i would like to continue with my own personal film company
thank you very much indeed really great fun to talk as a token of our gratitude we would like to present you with this priceless piece of jewellery the through the keyhole key which is our way of saying thank you very much and good luck with all those things you plan to do
thank you thank you very much thank you
i'm cooking with a couple of old birds today
old birds how dare you cheek
how are you ladies and gentlemen good to see you thanks very much brilliant good afternoon and welcome to ready steady cook fabulous food coming your way in a matter of minutes with food that the chefs have never seen before let's meet them along with our special birds of a feather guests that's got you going please welcome in the red kitchen with chef garrey dawson actress pauline quirke and in the green kitchen with chef paul rankin it's got to be linda robson
she's holding her hand up to wave i know
she wants to have a bit of a wave over there
linda you held your hand up to wave i've got bingo wings i weren't doing that there's no way i was doing that
bingo wings how lovely is that how lovely talking about cooking pauline if i came round to your house what would i find in your fridge
there'd be one or two bottles of wine plenty there's always plenty to eat in my house you can see i put it to good use
that's what it's all about we're going to put that to good use too tip that out
i'm tipping let's have a look at what you've brought for our garrey
fantastic i know you'll appreciate
nice bit of strong cheddar can't beat it a big spud some mushrooms chillies and some greens
i think greens are lovely
i prefer greens to cabbage
yeah cut them up and saute them off how much did you spend pauline i just went a little bit over
five point oh two oh we don't mind that at all
gosh it's lovely let's look we've got some cheese and potato so let's do a dauphinoise
oh let's potatoes
we might do something let's do a stir fry with half of the beef and the cabbage and some mushrooms we'll spice it up with chillies lovely then we might have to do classic steak and chips and see what else happens
all out of that yeah foh
you'll be busy you want to get him in your fridge
no room i told you
ladies and gentlemen garrey and pauline how are you very well how are you so good to see you again oh double double when did that double kissing come in
i can't remember when there was good looking people like you around i suppose
in ireland we still do the single kiss we're very shy do you with a beard like that you would absolutely my beard's all soft darling is it it's like a pastry brush
i wonder if she's got any soft ingredients do you like cooking i like it
but they don't like what i cook the family they get the hump i do try i try really hard you've been on masterchef haven't you
we'll find out her cooking skills we'll be able to pick up a few tips see the way she chops the onion and stirs things what have you brought along for paul
i've bought some chicken thighs i've bought an aubergine courgette rice black olives and tomatoes i think they're a bit underestimated the thighs
my favourite bit of a chicken and one of my favourite and one of the cheapest absolutely
really tasty how much did you spend i spent four point nine eight so i've got two p. spare that i'll give my friend pauline
ahh ahh
but if she wins i want it back
what do you think chef i think it's terrific
it's looking very mediterranean to me so i think it's southern mediterranean spain italy so i think we have a slow roast well not too slow we've not got long chicken i might do the thighs in one and the drumsticks in another um it's saying to me ratatouille that type of thing nice olive jus with that i think we can do a nice sort of pilau rice almost like a veggie paella type thing
sounding good
we've got a drumstick thing going almost like a tempura or crispy fried courgettes
lovely
peel me that potato first that would be fantastic and then i need some shredded cabbage take the base off take the root out chop it up nice and fine
what do you fancy no this chopper will do fine thank you lovely there we are a selection of knives be careful they're a bit on the sharp side that's what you'd expect in a professional kitchen
remember a sharp knife's a safe knife ahh
that's a good little tip isn't it remember a sharp knife is a safe knife people don't realise you get a blunt one you're trying to get into the tomato something happens
you cut yourself i know it can all be a bit nasty
right chef tell us about rump steak is it a cut that you prefer a lot of people do prefer the intensity of this type of meat
i think it's fantastic because it has got the marbling as pauline said earlier of fat which is so nice i actually like rib eye as well but the trouble is you have a lot of fat in the middle and a bit of sinew adds to the flavour but the texture's a bit tougher so people feel a bit cheated when they get a rib eye sure
when you go out to eat pauline do you go for the rump or fillet
to be honest i don't go out to eat that often what i'm finding more and more the bill is more memorable than the food you know it's true innit and also you should dump these london restaurants and come to a few belfast restaurants i'm going to be over there very soon you're coming over i'll be there i will cook for you did he say i'll do you a free meal pauline
there'll be a bottle of dom perignon waiting
it would be an honour to be fed by you paul an honour that's the opposition
the opposition shut up yeah
am i having a free meal at your restaurant garrey
you're not fussy are you no my love
but i think beef particularly steak is always a disappointment in a restaurant don't you think no
where do you like to go linda what's your favourite type of restaurant
at the moment i'm into noodles ah
you like your noodles i like thai do you like soupy noodles chicken or the vegetarian variety
both i love chicken i love vegetables as well so i mix the two and i'm happy linda took me to my first one of those the other week didn't you i did yes i didn't know what to order so basically she made me order everything i sat and watched her eat thirty worth of food thirty worth of food on my own
tastes good though it was lovely yeah it was lovely i suppose the secret of all of that garrey is the fact that they introduce chillies and soy and they've got lots of lovely big flavours
and like you said it's the variety people get bored you don't want to sit there with one big plate of food
tell us what's going on in here start with a bit of garlic garlic cream and then sliced potatoes
and you're also going to put cheese in cheese on the top loads of salt and pepper any nutmeg some people like it
what about the swiss variety emmental or dutch yes
they're all fine gruyere whatever you fancy you can use whatever
nice little tips i hope you're picking up some stuff guys let's leave pauline and garrey getting on dauphinois potatoes we've got that coming we've got a whole variety of things happening here he talked about that mediterranean influence let's see
i've changed my mind already i'm going to do one mediterranean but i'm going to do the drumsticks sort of curried spiced kind of thing so here i've got a mixture of cumin and coriander seeds a bit of black pepper a bit of salt i've cut in between the drumstick and the thigh to release it when you're boning out the thigh you come down on either side of that thigh bone then pinch it and come underneath and then underneath again and it just comes out ever so easily and you get this wonderful flat delicious roastable piece of chicken
and why do you prefer that i'm a leg man myself too sometimes a breast can dry out a little bit it's always a bit dry it can be you've got to be careful you can so easily overcook it you've only got a three or four minute window with this it becomes almost more succulent
it's got more structure and it's more juicy
it's got a little bit more texture and fat and flavour in it yeah erm now one thing i'm gonna do here i'm gonna roast it with a pan on top and this is what it's kind of like it's a sort of european recipe when you cook a chicken underneath a brick kind of thing and it presses it down and gives you that lovely crispy skin and it's gonna be delicious
it actually releases the juices so you get that caramelised sugars and everything coming out
you've done this before mr. harriott oh shut up he just likes winding me up
i just worry about all that washing up i can help you there and all love
what about you and your lovely mate how long have you guys been mates
er well we've been in the business forty years in january just gone
forty years in the business ladies and gentlemen come on
have you had rows not really i know when she's got the hump she knows when i do
we just give each other the wide berth that's the great thing about good friendships
you can have a bit of a go don't speak for a few weeks
then we see each other a lot it's one of those really we meet up every few weeks she comes down to me and has pie and mash in islington and i go up to buckinghamshire and have lunch up there
it sounds so posh buckinghamshire i know sounds very posh so yeah about thirteen minutes guys just under in fact
i feel like i'm not doing anything what about a job for her i should do something i chopped the onion i sliced the onion erm what shall we do now
what's it like in islington can you dice me that tomato please i know everyone in islington
i was born there never lived anywhere else i know everyone all the shops and stallholders
you do the fingers of courgettes i'll crack away here chopping this up a little bit
it depends how fat your fingers are how would that be
well is that too thick chef is that too big what are you looking for
if you do it like that cut it round there then you've got more control over it
what was your favourite period was it doing birds of a feather or recently you went on tour off to australia didn't you
yeah for three months had a great time took the kids out of school and we toured went to brisbane sydney melbourne and perth
were you comfortable taking the kids out of school yes and they were too they had a great time
we got to see lots of places we were on bondi beach and there was a shark we had to get out the water
that was lovely cos i'm not really into fish
you had what flatheads i think they're called i've not tried flatheads
have you not they're a bit like cod a very white flaky fish
so many varieties that part of the world aren't there yeah
quite different to what we have absolutely
i need you to make me a wee batter self raising flour and some fizzy water from the fridge
there's you bowl there's the fridge there's the fridge fizzy water is that the fizzy one
there's the self raising flour and there's ice in the freezer if the chef wants it
he's babying my contestant oh you know i'll baby you too you're flirting with my contestants again and again he's incorrigible how much flour do you reckon he loves it
it'll burn then we're gonna put it in the microwave
it'll cook it with dry heat and it'll go crispy and fry wow
there's a first time for everything there is so is this a first for you too yeah i've never heard of this what about masterchef i loved it are you a better cook now
it was interesting one thing i did learn from gregg and john they were saying that if something is green you basically put it into boiling water if it's green you put it into boiling water peas cabbage whatever if it's not green you put it into cold water and then let it boil but i loved it i'm a reasonable cook
what's your greatest achievement my kids you mean cooking yeah i don't know i had a disaster the other week with panna cotta
i turned that into scrambled egg which i didn't mean to you're supposed to melt the gelatine in the milk yes i had the milk too hot poured it in the egg mixture and it was scrambled eggs i know i've watched so many programmes like yours where they say when you have a disaster you can put it right no panna cotta once it's gone it's gone
i thought you didn't have egg in panna cotta i did make the sure the gelatine has melted properly stir it in put it in the fridge and it should be the easiest dessert on the planet do you pass yours off yes nice bit of muslin or your mum's tights
clean ones obviously no i couldn't use my mum's tights for panna cotta
what are we doing here bit of stir fried beef
stir fry the beef last minute quick brown off six minutes to go
nice little tip can you do that with other herbs
parsley works the best all right
yeah salt and pepper sesame seeds soy sauce and worcestershire sauce
and the char grilled onions onions and mushrooms to go with the steak
i've softened the vegetables and put them to one side so they don't overcook
i've had an incredible life i started when i was nine forty years ago at my primary school that's why i've started doing the pauline quirke academies so that kids can get the same chance i had
tell us about the academies we opened our first one last september
we've now got nine we have children from six to eighteen and we do three different modules we do comedy drama film and television and musical theatre
there's a lot of talent out there it's so great for kids
we don't run an agency so this is about fun not fame and we don't do big shows at the end of term because some kids get the big parts and some kids don't there's enough disappointments when you're an adult you don't want it when you're a kid exactly so true the children seem to love it and they learn all sorts of things
they'll go a bit more crispy and we'll let it cool dry
just giving it a bit of the old a bit of a waft look at that that beautiful stir fry vibrant greens all sorts of things let's see how paul and linda are getting on over here about three minutes to go how's it going i'm running out of space and i'm running out of time is that gonna be hot enough it's hot enough yeah
top man ainsley thank you
i don't know if we can get all of them in here we don't need all of them just three or four
this orange will be a garnish so i'll make it look attractive can you give me a little dice of the butter
i'll get this out of the way do the kids help when you cook
not really my son comes home and says i think i'll be vegetarian when there's lamb chops in the oven my daughter lauren she's twenty four she has to cook for herself is the old man quite good he'll have a go everyone has to move out of the kitchen while he's cooking and he clears up as he goes not like me what about vegetarian food do you like it when you go out to restaurants i love vegetables i don't like fennel two or three small dice that's the only vegetable i don't like we've got tempura cooking here
a couple of minutes to go now it's gonna get really tense it is tense
hurry up linda where do you want it shake it into that red wine olive jus there shake it into here and you've got to wiggle your hips as well do it like ainsley does it
i'm wafting she's wafting over there
put it on that high heat don't burn yourself just over here oh attaboy ainsley you show her there we are give it a shake that's it just shake it very gently there you go one and a half minutes to go so very little time this is the most fun we've had all week it really is i'm quite happy to stay here i'm not i'll let the chefs get on with it and let them get that food on to the plate this is when the excitement really begins to build ready for this pauline garrey linda and paul take it away
it's the last minute let's go go go waft waft waft less than a minute to go

thank you thank you not at all
brilliant food chef really really gorgeous food more delicious food coming your way in a moment but let's say thank you to a couple of british icons yes the lovely linda robson and pauline quirke take care let's meet today's quickie bag challenger let's welcome emily from north yorkshire hello emily hello you're part of the love food hate waste campaign tell us about that it's about reducing food waste and trying to make people aware
that they need to reduce food waste how much do we waste it's amazing if you go to the supermarket and buy three bags of shopping you throw one in the bin
it's sixty seven million tonnes of waste a year yes i can't believe that
it ends up in landfills which produces a lot of methane gas which is not good for the environment
something we are constantly thinking about now very important tell us what type of meals we can produce with leftovers so to speak half the time it goes in the bin
you need to try and use those up so if you've got leftover pasta you could make a frittata with some eggs leftover potatoes you could fry up a tortilla or something like that a tortilla yeah
and rice a bit of a stir fry yes any old rotten vegetables well not rotten vegetables put them in a soup and blend them up your mum's next to you did she bring you up very frugal yes very passionate about food i bet you love sending the children to her for the weekend yes thank you for coming emily hate waste campaign ladies and gentlemen
love food hate waste love food hate waste campaign emily thank you very much indeed
oh i think she's brought the contents of her fridge i'm worried about this bag bit of bread that's left over some potatoes half a grapefruit bits and pieces you have in your fridge half a tin of chickpeas a bit of lettuce gentlemen and a bit of cheese so often on ready steady cook we have everything in whole pieces and there is stuff left over it does go off to the canteen here but boys what can you do with this first up paul rankin
i think we've got definitely something going on with the lettuce i like the sort of almost like an oriental type thing where you build the lettuce up with the salmon chickpeas and mushrooms some spices in there i'd also do a hot bread salad so hot croutons with that we'd build it up with potatoes chickpeas mediterranean style i think there's room for one more maybe something with a bit of sweet and sour with the grapefruit in there again a salad i would say maybe with the salmon again
salmon and pink grapefruit is lovely and lots of fresh herbs maybe a few of the chickpeas a couple of nice ideas for the leftovers from our paul what about you then garrey a couple of ideas
he's nicked all mine yeah i'm starting to get more ideas this is stale so i'd cut the bread in half and char it and make like a tartine with the salmon i'd do a hot potato salad with the chickpeas and mushrooms i'd take some of the salmon and do a tomato and grapefruit fricassee and drop in some wilted lettuce and we might do a toasted cheese and lettuce salmon sandwich
lovely lots of lovely ideas circulating around both chefs as paul was saying more ideas come to mind all the time you've only got one choice red or green pick up your keypads and will you all vote now let's see what our studio audience has decided on today a lot of them have made up their mind it's all done now computer sort this out who has won today's ten minute quickie challenge it's a green kitchen win paul rankin our chefs' cooking time starts now what can i do for you
get some fresh coriander into that no problem mint too mint's lovely in there a thai vietnamese thing so garrey's got the croutons on with quite a bit of olive oil it's quite mediterranean they're not afraid of olive oil those will be lovely and hot did you want all these potatoes let's do a quick eggy thing do we have time oh yeah just cut them in half garrey perfect
now what about stale bread tips everybody's got stale bread bread and butter pudding
always a good one or eggy bread nice he's got all the good ideas
now they're coming out he didn't win
you can put breadcrumbs in your freezer how often do we want breadcrumbs on something sprinkle on top of casseroles a bit of cheese mixed in that's the best for my kids
they don't eat very much chicken but if i bread chicken and have some fresh breadcrumbs sitting dried up in the cupboard i just push it onto the chicken with a little salt and pepper they eat it much more readily
exactly a little crispiness people do like that kind of texture that crunchy texture
and something you said earlier about broccoli going a bit yellow i discovered if you look in the fridge before going shopping you buy a lot less and don't shop when you're hungry no no no
you buy stuff you don't need we're all guilty of that
i love that you break in to a packet of biscuits walking round the supermarket i like that it's kind of trampish or bohemian all the security guards will be following him round
won't they you don't need to be doing what i'm doing i'm trying to be posh
sometimes that's what you want to do with leftovers spend more time on how it looks sometimes
i think so too presentation is everything
that pan's hot is anyone using that one that's for you chef
happy with that paul let's taste it first
i'm putting eggs together for that omelette beautiful just in case lovely he likes it he likes it
i'm fussy aren't i ainsley i am fussy the sweet and sour dressing i'm making this up as i go along
do you want oranges in there too a combination of the two er
i was going to wait and see i'm not going to waste it i would eat it all right then a little bit of grapefruit juice and lemon juice and a pinch of sugar
i like soft scrambled eggs why is it that restaurant chefs always give you hard scrambled eggs
don't go to garrey's restaurant exactly
it's just because they've been there too long or are overcooked they should be last minute to order go somewhere else i've been all round the country and you say soft scrambled eggs
and they always end up being hard the french do the best scrambled eggs from my point of view
so i think if you find a nice sort of cafe slash bistro place which has a strong french basis they'll do scrambled eggs stirred with a spoon one of the secrets stir it with a spoon not a whisk and as they're coming up take them off the heat add butter and cream that stops the cooking process and keeps them lovely and soft the french are very good at it
i think you need to say to them i want them cooked like this and make them know exactly that you know how it's done
say ainsley harriott says now i can say i've watched the real chefs cook
so i can show them how to do it you're trying to win them over good question
very good indeed i think you're getting a scrambled egg here too no an omelette my apologies fingers crossed i'm getting very messy here so i need to tidy myself up
that's what my mum has taught me here we go guys
fifty seconds to go nice and hot got a nice dressing here with the tomato and olive oil
loads of time plenty plenty more citrus in there are you going to be ready
audience here we go count them down ten nine eight seven six five four three two one stop cooking that's very nice welcome back emily
oh wow gosh not bad eh i know so quick so easy it's great
get your cutlery so easy we're top chefs took all our lives to do this a nice combination of pink grapefruit tell us paul
i like that sweet and sour flavour with fish especially with the freshness of the iceberg lettuce and the grapefruit segments a dressing of grapefruit juice lemon juice tomato olive oil very easy to make a tomato and olive oil dressing this is a hot bread salad that garrey made bread plenty of olive oil sauteed mushrooms then added tomato to them sauteed potato as well exactly bring the whole thing together it's like a lovely hot side dish
the bread soaks it up that's just a perfect job
here's a couple of people we always enjoy linda and pauline come on then lovely lovely
it's very fresh the salmon with the lime juice the chilli the soy that's yours
hi there we have erwe are live with loads of stuff you need to know including this guy

look at those pants go
she's my daughter
hello dad
these five people are amongst the greatest quiz players in britain together they make up the eggheads arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country the question is can they be beaten welcome to eggheads the show where a team of five quiz challengers pit their wits against possibly the greatest quiz team in britain you might recognise them as they've won some of the country's toughest quiz shows they are the eggheads taking on our awesome quiz champions today are the granta gamesters the team are old school friends who three years ago got back in touch with one another after thirty years believe it or not apart they all live near the river granta in cambridge and now meet up three times a year to catch up let's meet them
hello i'm richard i'm fifty four and i'm a sales office manager
hi i'm bob i'm fifty three years old and i'm a builder
hi i'm rachel i'm fifty two and i'm a college tutor
hello i'm alan i'm fifty two and i'm an accountant
hello i'm peter i'm fifty three and i'm a project manager
welcome granta gamesters tell me about you getting back together this is due to the power of the internet
it is absolutely yeah we just got together on friends reunited i saw a few names and it just went from there it's been good fun
what was it like that first reunion after thirty years apart
i'm lucky i've got a reasonable memory for faces and people and i walked in and i could see who they were but there's others even their best friends they didn't recognise them it's strange i've been to a school reunion
the nicknames come back to you don't they
oh yeah and you nicked my dinner money you swine
you just regress don't you yeah but then we've never grown up anyway bit like that lot let's play the game then you take on the eggheads and try and take their money every day there's one thousand up for grabs for our challengers however if they fail to defeat the eggheads the money rolls over to the next show so granta gamesters the eggheads have won the last two games which means three thousand says you can't beat the eggheads and to do it you've got to knock them out in these head to heads and our first one is entertainment who'd like to play this any one of you
are you going to go for entertainment
who do you think
we just knew that was gonna happen
it's like a greek tragedy there's an inevitability about it
i'd like to go first please dermot
good luck rachel here we go with which musical instrument is the jazz musician kenny g. most associated
sounds a bit brassy yeah saxophone is the right answer good start rachel one to you chris who is the youngest of singer michael jackson's eight siblings
janet and jermaine are both sort of an age aren't they so probably as a salute to the late marshal tito of yugoslavia i'll say tito
which i'm sure is the reason he was named that not it's incorrect it is janet jackson oh right janet jackson is the youngest of michael jackson's eight siblings so that's an even better start then for you rachel you've got your first one right chris has failed with his so you can go into a two to zero lead if you get this one right which t. v. sitcom starred phil cornwell and john sessions impersonating various celebrities
i did not see them i didn't see any of those programmes actually so it's gonna have to be a guess but i seem to remember two people impersonating in stella street so i think that's going to be my answer
well worked out it is correct yes christian slater played churchill in the spoof the hollywood years but maybe only a reprieve for chris there rachel you put him out if you give me the correct answer to this question in the mel brooks musical the producers the max bialystock flop funny boy is a musical version of which shakespeare play
oh dear have you seen the producers rachel i remember something to do with germans in it um that's a very difficult one it's just going to have to be a guess i'm afraid um hamlet
is that peter we're looking towards peter
it'll be me
he's volunteered who do you want to play
who do you want to play
how about judith
she knows most of the politicians yeah i'll go for judith
yeah judith peter against judith
given our success in the first round i think i'll go first and follow rachel
nixon yeah it's correct well done good start peter and eggheads was that part of the resignation speech or was that
no it was before it was august seventy fourth when he resigned
yes it was during the watergate scandal
brezhnev was later it was stalin
stalin yes leader of the soviet union between nineteen twenty four and nineteen fifty three so back to you peter a second question heinz fischer became president of which country on eighth july two thousand four
heinz fischer you think became the austrian president on eighth july two thousand four and you'd be right to think that it is correct two to you judith which labour prime minister said he would choose lord love a duck of limehouse if he were forced to accept a peerage
jim callaghan did accept a peerage and he wasn't called lord love a duck of limehouse i think it might be tony blair
yes and he'd also been mayor of limehouse as well
the borough of stepney yeah borough of stepney
we try our best on eggheads you know peter
i haven't heard it associated with marx i think i will go for anarchism
not a book i'm going to ever read i don't think um i haven't the first clue erm michel foucault
oh well done peter
peter you're through to the final round as well joining rachel there playing for three thousand today judith you won't be helping the eggheads out would you both come back and join your teams i'm not tempting fate here but a great start by the granta gamesters two eggheads gone you're all there at this point two more head to heads to play let's see how the rest of the game goes and see if we can keep up that momentum gamesters our next head to head is going to be on the subject of sport who'd like to play this and it can only be one of alan bob or richard
is it you certainly not me no
so it's going to be me
i'd like to go first please
good luck alan here's your question then in which european city would you find the feyenoord stadium
well feyenoord play in the dutch league so i would choose rotterdam
isn't jonny wilkinson a fly half i think he wears number ten i know the hooker's eight i have no idea what a full back is but simply because i think wilkinson might be a fly half and wears number ten i'm going to go for fly half
that is the correct answer jonny wilkinson led you to fly half that's correct well done good start for you both one each alan second question which weightlifting discipline was removed from olympic competition following the nineteen seventy two games
well i'm afraid i know very little about weightlifting i think the press is still in existence so i think i'll go for the curl
i did read this i'm just trying to think it's not the football league i think it's the national basketball association
um i have no idea at the moment so i'll have to try and calculate something he was certainly performing in that sport for a lot of years and there are quite a number of races in a year so i think i'd discount fifty one i think i would go for zero point nine one
well bob
i think i'll play we want richard in reserve for the general knowledge so i am to be sacrificed
you've got plenty in reserve for that anyway bob who would you like to play it has to be either daphne or kevin
daphne
i do or i did i worked for that lady while she was actually writing the story
you weren't humming any tunes at the time that they might have picked up
i think i'll break the mould and go second please
one of my favourites duck
well i don't know any cocktail recipes but it seems to me whenever you see a cocktail it's based on orange juice so i'll just go with that i think
well zucchini are those little like courgettes i think it's capsicum
erm see them a lot don't you yeah
but what are they called
there's a name for them i think i could eliminate all three of the ones you've got up there but i'll eliminate linguini and farfalle and go for fusilli
fusilli is the right answer yes well worked out bob two two daphne the round flat bread lavash originated in which country
oh dear don't know i am going to guess at armenia
um well i suppose if it's red wine the bordelaise could have some tie in with bordeaux couldn't it it could have yeah really this is just a guess so i'll stick with that bordelaise
sheep
it would help if i knew some greek wouldn't it or if i knew anything about gwyneth paltrow i suppose no i really couldn't string two coherent greek words together and come up with a sensible answer sorry i don't know
macrobiotic
i think we'll go back to our original winning ways and go first
it's general knowledge best of luck let's see if you can beat the eggheads it's balanced in your favour after those head to heads here's your first question then in the human body what type of joint is the shoulder in the human body what type of joint is the shoulder
ball and socket we should be confirming now
structurally it sounds good ball and socket
right ball and socket
ball and socket not much consultation then and you got it right yes ball and socket the shoulder joint eggheads brachioplasty is plastic surgery on which part of the body
yes one to you gamesters the headquarters of the international olympic committee are located in which swiss city
that's a sporting one alan it is yeah any idea
do you like any of those i'm not certain but i'd guess going for geneva
you'd go for geneva
i think it's going to be zurich or geneva myself
you'd go for geneva
right we're going to go for geneva
lausanne lausanne
known to her friends as sue sue nicholls we hope anyway in which case it's audrey
worked out there yes sue nicholls is audrey in coronation street so you've got to get this one gamesters to keep the game going which ancient people once masters of a great empire now form part of a dwindling christian community in modern day iraq
the phoenicians had a big empire but they were based around the mediterranean they were sailors i think it's the assyrians
assyrians do you think so what's the argument for assyrians
i don't think it's the other two
right so you think phoenicians from around the greek area
they were around the mediterranean i'm sure i'm sure the etruscans i think they were greek to start with i mean unless you got anything else
i think sorry go on you finish
go with it right we'll go with assyrians please dermot
well done
assyrians part now of a dwindling christian community in modern day iraq but but but slipped up on your second one so the eggheads will win it if they get this correct eggheads gondar near lake tana was the national capital of which african country until one thousand eight hundred fifty five
yeah which then became addis ababa it's ethiopia i mean i don't mean gondar became addis ababa it moved the capital moved but it's ethiopia anyway it's the ancient capital
and violence of the tax and violence a blow to lebanon's fragile government as hezbollah seized parts of beirut under government control
will the country pullback from the blink from the brink of all out conflict hello and welcome it is almost a week since the cyclone struck burma and the tidal wave swept away whole villages tens of thousands have died yet the suffering survivors have yet to receive the desperately needed eight that they need it is reckoned that only a fraction of victims have been reached in a country the size of france the humanitarian operation has fallen victim to politics the ruling junta is suspicious of the outside world it does not want foreign relief workers in the country un officials are discussing with the burmese authorities how best feature aid can be distributed future seven days after the cyclone struck and things are not getting much better for the people still stranded in the irrawaddy delta bodies lie strewn across this landscape local red cross workers told us diseases like dysentery are already getting a grip there is still no relief effort to match the size of the catastrophe the cyclone caused enormous destruction of tearing apart homes and knocking down bridges and blocking roads it does not seem to have been the main cause of those tens of thousands of death the tidal surge washed away entire communities husbands and wives mothers and children swept a part in an instant now the survivors search for their loved ones but there are not enough people to help them that is how it may stay today the military leaders told the world they intended to run this rescue effort on their own a was welcome but the experts with the skill to deliver it was not eight
that despite present efforts the task is just too big for the government to go it alone the destruction it is obvious and so it is the fact that just a few hours from rangi income a people are not getting the help they need rangoon people are not the burmese officials have just closed their offices for a three day holiday no such luck for the million or more people locked away in the flooded delta in the past few minutes in new york the un humanitarian affairs chief has launched an appeal to help the victims of the cyclone he said the priority was to help those in need as quickly as possible
after the devastating effects of cyclone nargis which struck the country on second may we must help the government help the people in need as rapidly as possible the flash appear that we are launching today offers a co ordinated preliminary plan by the humanitarian community to complement and supplements the efforts of the government in providing assistance to give so riders let me say right away that i had contemplated the spending this lodge in the news about extra difficulties facing un shipments and humanitarian staff not already in the country but i decided the priority has to remain all we can to get through to the people in such desperate need on the ground
more on burma and a little later in a programme the b. b. c. has learnt of alleged plans by the governing zanu p. f. party in zimbabwe to intimidate voters by putting militants supporters known as war veterans in police uniforms at polling stations a serving police officer in zimbabwe told the b. b. c. that this was the case there is no date for the run off between president mugabe and that lisa offbeat opposition morgan tsvangirai and the leader of the opposition we went undercover in zimbabwe for this special report at a remote location good deep in the bridge we met this serving police officer who wanted to reveal what president mugabe had up his sleeve bluish he showed us his identity card but we cannot reveal his name he would be risking his life if he tried to stop the operation
does not work there are much tougher tactics
torture him or we will not be able to get any evidence out of him they said they would crash each finger they managed to crash of one finger and then i managed to break away crashed one finger
supporters and activists who are now on the run
off we suspect that the seven african development community will have a large role to play and is as will the african union and the united nations as well for people to vote again when they are being beaten and attacked is not feasible conditions have to change so electoral processes can go on and there can be a one off
failed he is in charge of a government that is carrying out human rights abuses against his own citizens he should not be still in power if that is the way he is going to carry out an administration that said i think this reminds me very much of the period in south africa when water was coming to an end he put bureaucrats in charge it was the end for botha it shows you have no
it is senior general than shwe and nothing important will be done without his say so it is the generals immediately around him the spdc the ruling military council there's an awful lot of arm twisting going on in the un at the moment i think the critical player in this is china there have been attempted in the last few days to try and force something through the un but china backed by russia and vietnam and indonesia have sort of slowed things down all along there are the obstructions of because of sanctions that has driven burma into the hands of china to the extent as far as mandalay with china burma can be considered a chinese client state
as a bald summary that is fair they come out of a tradition of warrior kings the iconic feature is the giant statues of the old warrior king of burma they see themselves as the inheritors of that tradition and they historically the rulers of burma have seldom cared very deeply or profoundly of the the people they rule over
isn't the case that some of the affected parts are heavy recruiting areas for the army
that is absolutely the point if you go back to last sent with the monks coming out on the streets there were problems in the army there were some army units which would not move against the monks i think the splits within the army
who are directly affected there are local commanders who are now getting very fed up with the seniors
what two comes to distributing the aid there are lots and lots of soldiers in burma they have good local knowledge they are not up to doing it could they seek assistance from disaster relief from indonesia does it help have to be help from the un
i would have thought indonesia and sri lanka and bangladesh could be extremely helpful they want to get the referendum through have that stitched up they will get the result that they want and that is their priority and quite honestly it is sick
doesn't it perhaps provide the opportunity the constitutional referendum to kick start a gradual reform process in
than shwe is seventy five in failing health not in good shape is he not looking to try to secure his supporters' future
there is a succession crisis that has been going on or a succession movement since last year
is the constitutional referendum partly to try and help that
it is to do with the general's insecurity they are worried they will be prosecuted one day for their crimes against humanity i would be very surprised if than shwe is still in power by the end of the power it may be another general like the number two who would probably take over
in lebanon the show of strength by the opposition group hezbollah has dealt a major blow to the credibility of the weak central government they have seized control of most of western beirut in a third day of fighting between opposition and government supporters hezbollah seized officers of the sunni group led by saad al harriri the latest violence has raised the ugly spectre of all out conflict in lebanon it's a coup by any other name shi'ite gunmen from hezbollah and its opposition allies battled it out with government supporters in many parts of west beirut after a night of gunfire and explosions it was virtually all over now hezbollah fighters control virtually all of west beirut it's a huge shift in the balance of power here syria and iran both support the opposition which now dominates the street the take over hasn't been welcomed by many there has been panic buying of food there has to be a compromise solution says this resident what has happened is unacceptable it is like being under siege foreign visitors are also voting with their feet packing and leaving as they did when israel attacked two years ago the lebanese army has intervened to protect the lives and the homes of the main politicians who support the government here but they have done nothing to stop the take over of the streets by hezbollah that's left of the government looking extremely weak and toothless this is where the embattled prime minister and members of his western backed government are hold up they may have western and arab support but that looks theoretical now for the past eighteen months hezbollah has been physically besieging the government building there's no doubt the militants could take over r. with very little trouble one way or another it's clear the government has lost its grip now it's a transatlantic treasure trove row spain is demanding the return of seventeen tonnes of gold and silver coins salvaged by a florida based company last year madrid insists the fortune was found on a nineteenth century spanish frigate it was one of the most exciting deep sea discovers of our times half a million gold and silver coins raised from a wreck in the atlantic and promptly transported to florida by the american company which located the ship the negligence from madrid is not so fast the government is convince message the government is convinced the wreck is the mers des it says it is spanish property and the u. s. company should return the treasure
what odyssey has done is morally and legally unacceptable in a similar case involving spanish navy frigates lagalgo and huno the treasure hunters were required to return every single coin and other artefact they had taken they were prohibited from any other further disturbance of the ships and they were not denied any compensation not one penny
it has taken the spanish a year to positively identify the ship last july the police here detained one of odyssey's treasure hunting records hoping computer records would reveal the wreck's exactly location it was only last month the company admitted the treasure had come from the mercedes a judge in miami will rule on the rightful ownership of the coins whose value has been estimated as half a billion dollars a reminder of the top story hundreds of thousands of survivors of the cyclone in burma have still received no aid this is world news today that's all from the programme next on b. b. c. four the weather goodbye and have a good weekend a big ridge of high pressure to the east of the british isles there's one little weather front giving us a few showers there will be good sunny spells for many of us notice a weak weather front that will be the focus for showers in the day otherwise high pressure building in with the flow off the continent very warm air one or two showers we'll see perhaps a few into the afternoon decent sunny spells aberdeenshire seeing eighteen nineteen the borders seeing one or two showers come further south from that and much of northern england having a good looking after down to the south east looking fine london twenty six twenty seven the south coast looking fine maybe one or two showers south west parts of england fine easily into the twenty's parts of wales a few showers here into the course of the afternoon and into northern ireland cloud with maybe a small risk of a shower as we finish off the course of the day the ridge of high pressure fizzles out and we regain the ridge of high pressure for sunday it is a drier day for many of us there still mighting a few showers of weaker energy elsewhere good sunny spells
this politician wasn't taking any prisoners in nineteen eighty five
breakfast was almost always a porridge of boiled wheat with milk and honey if there was any
and the team have a lovely weekend hello welcome to the one show with christine wallace wallace or have a certain ring about it we have a man who he sweet john sergeant isn't he sweet waiting this week on the who have put their lives on the line bob hogarth is a retired military man who lives in the grounds of the chelsea roqyal hospital what kind of response do we get from people
we're spoiled really l. think there's one particular pub down here which i don't go in myself but where virtually all the beer is bought for the chelsea pensioners
chelsea pensioners like bob may get a warm welcome wherever they go about you with many people opposed to recent conflicts in iraq and afghanistan is the public's attitude to the armed forces changing is britain still proud of its boys five years ago seven hundred fifty thousand people marched in protest against sending our troops into iraq it's become harder for soldiers to wear
i'm sure you've heard the news members of the armed forces have been told not to wear their uniforms in public how do you feel about that
it doesn't make any sense at all especially when the present day members of the armed
l'm based in windsor which is a garrison town it's not unusual to see soldiers nip to the bank it's not unusual to see them i've never had a bad response it's always been favourable
wouldn't that help them understand the role of the military
military from recruiting on the premises shaun tell me about this motion that you've passed in the student union
a group of students felt that certain issues regarding the war in iraq and other things wasn't really appropriate that the military should be recruiting on our campus
some people would find that really insulting
it was written into the motion that wa that it was about the government's decision to go to war
it may have been about the government's decision but the decision was to exclude the armed forces was it responsible to do that
it was passed it was therefore the right thing to do as it respected the voice of the majority of our members at the meeting
back to the second world war almost every family had someone who served in uniform they knew all about it people now don't there's a democrat danger of the armed forces becoming a separate caste in society
military insulations open days we're looking at parades home coming parades particularly have
i'm here because i lost my leg in basra a year ago to roadside bomb
why is today different from other pageants and parades
and harry were in attendance giving the city salute something of a celebrity presence but will this help change attitudes
you're all dressed up
when were you when you were down there then
the pomp of military pageant such as a royal tournament may be a distant memory but this new style event seems to highlight modern day sole jerg is there a change in attitude to people like yourselves particularly those who are injured
more hand shakes on the trains more pats on the back on the tubes more beers bought for me it makes
losing leg almost bearable when
complete stranger comes up to to you and says thank you
in the second world war everyone was grateful because the armed forces saved the country that gos on for a long time then you get the people in national service now yes these wars are controversial and also we're worried about glorifying militarism and mill teristic activity that's the problem it's not the british way to say the army are wonderful the whole time dictators do that
our american counterparts seem to celebrate their forces much better than we do
they certainly do that's the american thing they pledge allegiance to the flag
that comes
what do you feel when you see a soldier or
i don't see a lot of them in uniform when they wear uniform i don't think there's anything wrong with it we
of day do any harm oh it's
as with all these things it mustn't be overdone
against women maybe it's a particular type of woman but there's anger there to do what he did in terms of he killed them to mutilate them
jack the ripper is pretty clear what he does
that's correct
from monster to media to myth jack is now part of the tourist trade
we're standing at commercial street at the epicentre of the murders this is the area where the killings occurred this is the area where the victims lived
one hundred twenty years two hundred boks and countsless theatres later we're still looking forlet man who wrote his name in history with the blood of his victims
had this happened present day we would have a range of techniques and experts that we'd call upon l. feel confident that we would have a name and an address and we'd be able to knock on the door and have a very good idea who the offender was
perhaps the truth is we don't want to solve the mystery because when we know who done it it's all over jack the ripper this one will run and run
i was listening to the music there
did you always want to get the do do at end of the story
it never bothered me
if you got a big duff duffer it never really
he's so safe isn't he
what do you mean
it's long ago he doesn't feel like threatening it's a nice period flavour nobody knows who did it can you all have theories of it it's safely in the past that's one of the attractions
when do we celebrate our current killers then one hundred years time people romanticise this
that's right some of the horrible things that this guy in austria you can't imagine people going on about him the modern crimes are so frightening jack the ripper isn't frightening he's a fairytale
an old spirit similar to jack the ripper
you've moved on you're about to
you look scary there jelly i mean jessie
you were about to tell us what it was all about
it starts with a dinner party where my character has her friends round she's live anything this flat in bermondsey she talks about the history of the building and what happen thrd years ago so it turns into this from something like abigail's party to who's afraid of virginia woofl into the shining because she becomes possessed by this spirit and ends up killing people
are there special effects
yeah a lot of special effects for the audience a lot of things happen round the auditorium you see things out of the corner of you're eye you get smells from the stage it's a great experience to see it
it opens on
best of luck with that all week we've had a daily appointment at doctor jarvis' clinic of curious conditions one show viewers have been going very public with their very private medical complaints not private any more
to them all we give a hearty thanks we've had wind itching flat feet and sweating
we should have found
marcus is twenty eight a successful salesman with persuasive technique
i'm a jovial character l. tend to see the funny side if life and in people i'm italian l. like to wear nice sharp trendy clothes l. like going to the gym l. go two to three times aye week
get my chest out on holiday lastory a kid came up to me and pointed at me and said look at that hairy monkey there i laughed at it but i definitely want the back hair to go it's just only going to get worse later in life
people girls that i'm very hairy with the back it is kind of tends to be kind of more like a freak show really
cells that make up the hairs on our heads are programmed to go on multiplying by half a mill metre a day for years they help to keep us warm every couple of months nature has decided that the velous hair on the arms and backs should take a rest break and fall out no one knows why humans are the least furry primates marko's body hair is probably genetically programmed to grow long and lush it's a cosmetic not a medical problem if you really can't live with it the only solution is to pay to live without it
treatments for example for sporting reasons i treat a cycling club for waxing removing the hair from the legs and forearms to make them more stream lined
claire will try two different treatments she will wax the bottom half and laser his shoulders so he can compare the results she starts by razoring the longest hairs on his back it's not true that shaving makes your hair grow quicker but it only removes surface hair and the new hairs have blunt ends where they've been cut waxing will provide a longer lasting solution
wax will cost up to forty and needs to be repeated about every six weeks for the other half of his back claire is trying laser treatment using intensive pulseles of light which it's claim kd remove up to ninety five per cent of body hair for good it can only be done in small sections at a time
you'll feel a warm continuingling sensation the light will travel down the shaft of the hair and destroy the follicle
it would cost around one thousand to laser all marko's back hair there's risk of scarring and pigment damage it must be done by
was it all worth it
doctor sarah is here as is marko thank you very much for coming in let me first ask jessie do you
you like them quite hairy
my fiance yeah
yeah but not that much if you look at the bottom which is where marko had the wax we would expect that to grow back pretty much as it had before within about six weeks it's a complete myth that waxing or shaving makes it come back thicker but it make it's come back with blunt ends so it can look thicker at first at the top here where marko had alasers ah part from the patches here there's virtually
growing back thicker
cause hairiness
it's much more of a problem in women certainly if she puts on weight maybes develops acne stops having regular periods there's a condition called polycystic oafery syndrome you need to be aware of that very rarely there's a problem with tumours extremely rare in the vast majority of people they're made that way
turn yourself round a bit you don't have hair actually on your hands do you
not the palms let's have lock at your palms
mean mine look thought it was quite normal but if you have a curious complaint condition you'd like to share with the nation get in touch we will show it off to the nation
very cheap gag there time for the latest in john's fantastic and occasionally troubling series about spotters those passionate about stuff the rest us couldn't get passionate about if our lives depended on it
lorries for example last time we met katie gales one of the country's top lorry spotters did we make her day by delivering a scania r. series five hundred eighty straight to her door i've never given a woman so much pleasure
so i hear
just look at her
tonight we meet a pair who spend their spare time travelling the highways of britain in order to spot well the highways and byways of britain
for most people the only roads they love are empty roads you find yourselves saying this is a nice road so empty but the rest of the time roads are simply a routine necessity unless that is your best mates chris marshall and steven jukes you love roads don't you
enthusiastic and then some
not just a normal interest we're talking about passion and love
something deep seated and slightly disturbing
that's fabulous some of the sticks are straight and some are triangular
there was a real excitement about freedom of movement when road building got under way in the sixties people were excite b. d. this kind ever thing
that romance of the open road lives on for chris and steven for them a road trip is always something special and worthy of capturing on video
it helps to have a record of what you've been to see
like hollywood that
a bit less narrative than your average hollywood film
the obsession with tarmac signs and maps began early
spent a lot of time in the car as a child when you're that small your view is restricted would arrive at a family's house and i would say i saw a new sign on the ring road for headingley they would say that's interesting thought it was normal when you get older you realise it's not so normal
one of the boys favourite thorough fares is in west london
such is their passion for roads there are things that chris and steven spot that we don't and goodness they matter
oh man l. mean how bad is that
that's trorbs
that is awful take a look that's wrong in so many ways count them count the ways
what's wrong
that's mini round about this is showing full one krn sheen itself there's something wrong there they have got four letters squashed up to one degree
and it's in capitals which is more difficult to read quickly than in mixed case
your emotions at this point
guessed it there's a website chris and steven are members of sabre the society for all british road enthusiasts and they keep a personal website recording absurdities and anomalies it's so comprehensive that even civil servants at the department of transport sometimes consult it you put pictures on the internet so that people can enjoy the mistakes
cares there's something exciting about that
open and these sciens that still looks all right to me john i could see you got quite into lorries last time could you understand what this pair were on
one minute fifteen left
we have sent our road spotters there that's where she was born
oh my god if you walk up this way i was born on the other side of the road
in sabre going mad over the curvy seventies lights in concrete very excited people watching right now
of course if we look around the corner we have something interesting we have a street that just suddenly turns one way half way down very unusual quite peculiar and confusing for the average person
to live there used to babysit me
she's reminiscing
gentlemen thank you very much have a happy weekend road spotting lovely to have you on jessie lovely to have you on
thank you
you've missed a bit don't you think you're getting away with that yeah that one over there jon if you do that bit that will be great i like trees because they come from so many different parts of the world every tree grows differently they're nature's living works of art and it actually amazes me how they cope with all the pressures that we put them under today are you right jon
what trees means to me is it gets me away from everyone else there's lots of problems in the world but getting in the tree i'm away from my boss as well which is down there and i'm just my own boss and you know trees they were put on the planet to climb i'm sure being in the top of a tree you get a lovely feel to it you know especially a tree like this one of my favourites it's great the feeling of them the leaves around you shading you they're just fantastic living things
i want to make trees matter to people today
together with his best tree climber jon hammerton tony's on a mission to discover whether in the early years of the twenty first century we still value the trees that made britain nearly ninety per cent of all trees in britain are found in forests maintained and jealously protected since ancient times to provide the timber to build and defend a nation but suddenly in recent years everything's changed
when i was a lad i started off in traditional forestry i'm told that if i go back i won't recognise it
today for tony there are some surprises in store tony and jon have made their first stop in dalby forest in yorkshire
forestry used to be about harvesting and production but now it's about something completely different
tristram mayhew is the inventor of go ape a twenty first century enterprise redefining what it means to turn trees into profit
how did you come up with this idea
you're a bit canny because you've designed this you haven't been on it yourself yet jon and i are going to be the guinea pigs i may be into adventure but i'm not daft
if it holds you i'll be right behind you nice
this latest forest attraction will be tristram's twelfth course tapping into a seemingly endless supply of people prepared to pay over twenty a head to test their nerve and get up into the branches
this is going to be an incredible way to see trees
it's just a beautiful place to be and i think the japanese have got a word for what they call a tree shower where you just lie on the ground look up at the trees and sort of feel the vibes through you and that may be going a bit far but they've definitely got something in that we do this for fun
well we've come all the way up now we've come through all the larches and we're right in the top canopy the tops of the tree are level with us it's a fantastic feeling you are amongst the giant trees now and you're up the top you can see all the natural history all these larches are coming into leaf and flower it's stunning and looking ahead it looks pretty awesome but i think the key to it is these trees that it goes through so you're right there in the canopies going through i can't wait to see the view up the valley there's nothing can happen eh jon see you down the other end that is absolutely amazing how was that for you tristram i loved it actually
it was great to go down for the first time
ten years ago people wouldn't be in here it would have been a working forest that's starting to disappear but you're bringing people back here how does that feel
it's really interesting to be part of this the forestry commission used to grow timber to sell for poles and getting people in the forest caused health and safety issues now they recognise that the forest as an amenity value is almost as valuable as the timber production they can do and they're working to get both the recreation and the harvesting side to work side by side
we're only halfway around we've got to do the other half before we pass it and it can be open we've got to get back across that valley so i presume you've got another surprise round the corner
well why walk when you can fly
to a degree recreation is the new forestry tony has big plans for the following day but before the next stage of the journey he's decided to stop for the night
tristram said something about the japanese have a term called tree showers where you lie down on the ground under a tree and you let the vibes of the tree come through you let's give it a whirl is it happening for you jon
not at all
no there's not a lot really happening for me neither nice view you're not getting those vibes though
no i feel like a right prat actually
yeah
how can it be cheaper to produce timber abroad and ship it over here cheaper than we can grow it ourselves i'm off to the airport to find out
tony has travelled to a wood mill in sweden the european tree capital this yard processes and replants over one million trees every year
proper this is forestry on a big scale now this is one hell of a machine that we're going to see by the looks of things
this is a world class state of the art factory like the task itself all of the machinery is massive
this is one of the biggest pieces of kit you're ever going to get your hands on and hammerton's in control
while jon gets to grips with the technology tony has come to meet forest manager per bengtsson to discover how britain lost out
per what do you know that we don't know
for us it's the future in sweden most of the forest land is owned by private owners anyone the postman the teacher the plumber anyone owns the forests in sweden
but it's not just the forest culture that pushed sweden ahead of the game the country drove the development of extraordinary machinery that pushed prices down
well that was just unbelievable i drive a forklift at work but it's like a little baby compared to that when they said forklift you expect it to have a couple of forks but this has got a claw on it
and inside the scale is no less extraordinary every day the factory turns over three thousand trees into planks ready to be shipped to britain europe and the world
last year we saw how they used to square a log off it used to take a whole day just to do one piece
the traditional method needed up to two men to produce a square log in just under a day in the factory a single person turns out a square log every three seconds
it's an amazing thing isn't it that this whole process this whole part of the factory is run by one man
as a result of vast forest factories like this british forests became uncompetitive and it wasn't just sharp eyed entrepreneurs that responded it's reckoned that many accessible forests now make more money from the machine in the car park than they do from selling wood britain's single largest forest owner is the forestry commission it was set up in nineteen nineteen to safeguard the national supply of timber but finding new ways to persuade us to stop in the forest is now the greatest challenge for those who need to make trees pay on a grand scale the commission is always on the lookout for ingenious ways to draw people in
hi i'm tony hi helen
helen emery is one of the growing band of people licensed to use the caledonian forest for dog sledding
so dog sledding helen it's starting to bring more people into the forest it's starting to use the forest as a recreational resource definitely definitely
there's races all over the u. k. now every weekend there's probably two or three races as well as people training three four five times a week so we're using the forest and making the most of the permissions we have to use these trails
it's not like riding to work on your mountain bike is it tony
basically you stand on the footplates and you do need to use the brakes particularly when you are running with the dogs the brakes are paramount
mine's got blades on the wheels
how do you feel er
he's coming back
oh easy easy what an experience that was fantastic coming down that hill round the corner we were in total control fantastic run with him jon he said yeah all right i tell you what there's no way you're jumping off and running with us no way
that's a very good start
frightening yeah cos they are shifty
what was jon's time helen
four minutes three hundred sixty two
and what was i four minutes forty six forty six ten seconds i don't think he went as far as i went i think matt came down the track
i don't think he did he went further eh give over
helen that's been great and it is quite exhilarating but is it really bringing a lot of people into forests
the aviemore sled dog rally features teams of between two and eight dogs running at up to twenty miles an hour over a gruelling four mile track the race always takes place in january and at the coldest time of the year the forest is already experiencing visitor numbers to rival mid summer tony and jon have tracked down forest ranger jim gillies to see how he feels about this invasion into his tranquil world
well thirty generations of these trees date back to the last ice age when you go back ten thousand years ago you could still do some form of recreation in glenmore but you had to have blue blood in your veins these were the hunting grounds for the kings of scotland and today you see two thousand people here enjoying themselves i think it's tremendous that's what it's all about now it's the changing face of forestry most people come here just to do some form of walking dog walking picnicking or you get adrenaline junkies coming to do off road mountain biking so it's a forest for all people
by midday it's time for helen's race
the adrenaline's going in my body
yeah just walking up the path i think helen's just hanging back with the lead dog cos she gets excited
the dog not helen i hope they don't set off
five four three two one go
yeah we estimate about fifteen minutes fifteen to eighteen minutes and then we'll go to the finish and watch her come in see how she goes you'll know it's helen you can hear her that's helen here she comes come on come on helen come on helen
helen took eighth place in her race and before heading south tony called into her house on the edge of the great caledonian forest
not a victory no but still a good placing it was i was pleased with that and a fantastic setting for a race like that you must take all that in while you're going around as well you try to
it's just stunning it's absolutely beautiful this piece of forest i can see myself moving here yep
the collapse in the price of british timber has caused a complete rethink on the purpose of our forests while once their sole function was to produce wood now the national forests have two other goals the first recreation is widely advertised but the second is kept quiet
we've been told to follow this van to a secret location
the protection of this particularly tranquil corner of the lake district is so important that tony was not told where he was going and filming was only permitted on condition the location would be kept secret for ever
this is where lippy comes into her own now we must be here
you survived oh yes i think that was the limit of lippy that
almost half of all the species in the world live in the tree tops which makes the forest canopy one of the most important ecological assets on the planet taking care of the forest ecosystem is now a multi million pound concern in the early part of the last century the last british osprey vanished and no osprey visited britain for almost fifty years here a project is under way to encourage the osprey to return to the lake district
well the object of the exercise today is to create a platform in this tree this tree has been selected by mike from the forestry commission it's a scots pine and that is a favourable nesting site we're going to put a platform up there build a fake nest dress it in osprey droppings and then it will be used to attract this rare bird something different it beats building blue tit boxes in the conservation area
as kew's expert tree climber scaling a tree like the chosen scots pine is all in a day's work for jon
i've come out of the wood and it's a fantastic landscape around we're not allowed to film it because we don't want to give away the site and there are landmarks in the area that will actually give away the site because this bird is sought after by collectors and there are people who will come and take the eggs or wreck the nest so we need to keep that site secret what we're doing now in the tree jon and mike are taking out the top of the tree what they want to do is create a fork effect at the top so they can sit the platform on the base of the nest we're actually sacrificing a pine and it's a nice pine it's a shame but this is a very important bird and if a bird comes and uses this nest that will be a fantastic result for this area
first lake district tree not what i would have done to them normally but obviously as you can see we've got thousands of pine forest around us and there's not thousands of ospreys so to do this to one tree and to be putting a nest in for a magnificent bird is great for me
the forestry commission now spends up to thirty million every year on environmental projects helping a range of plants and wildlife
blimey jon what are you doing building a pterodactyl's nest
we need a bag of small sticks before the moss
they're pretty fussy got to be so long so thick and they've got to be birch or scots pine do you think they'll know do you think they have a tree identification guide in their wings
are you sure they didn't put a brick in the bottom yeah i think they have
now the reason the sticks fell out of that pack was the way that he pulled it up
just two in there
next we need to fill it in with moss
so are we done mike it's nearly complete
there's just one final thing to do which is send up the white paint
why do we need white paint
give the idea to the ospreys that another osprey has been splashing all over it
can we have some white paint please tony creamy white or white white creamy white please
spray cans aren't the best thing so fingers crossed it works as well
poo poo white that's right yeah so mike there is obviously a way of doing this so i'll let you show me the way
yeah imitating splashing so we're going to imitate some bird poo
they obviously poo poo big poos work of art
and that's it complete cheers mike thank you let's hope the ospreys come and enjoy yeah that'll be something to look forward to in the future my mission's complete for today
four months later and one of the man made nests has an amazing result it's hoped these young osprey will enjoy their prefabricated homes so much they'll return next year to join the elite band of twenty first century british osprey the great forests are now managed as parks and wildlife habitats alongside the commercial industry although britain has imported wood since the middle ages it's only recently that exporting countries have severely driven the price down threatening both the very survival of british forests and the livelihoods of those who worked in them including one young man with his heart set on forestry
this is where i had my first job we were pioneers in growing trees we were pushing the frontiers pushing the boundary to reforest the scottish mountains and one day two years into the apprenticeship that i was doing the managing director took me to one side and said listen laddie change your career get out of forestry because it's going to die and that was a massive blow for me but i took their advice and i moved out
tony left these nurseries before tilhill closed them for good keen to see if anything survives of the industry he set out in tony's heading back to scotland to meet tilhill's george mcrobbie and find out what became of the trees he helped to plant over half a lifetime ago
i think he thinks he grew half this forest i'm just gonna let him get on with what he's doing and i'll stay behind and enjoy the trees
these are probably some that i handled on the nursery in tilford this might be one that i actually sowed the seed and lifted and sent up here for planting in scotland who would have guessed that i'd come back and see these
with the return to sustainable resources here in the wide open spaces of the highlands trees are once again proving profitable
so the wood that we've just come through when would that be ready for harvesting
bits have already been harvested if you look behind you on the other side of the loch that area there has just literally this last year been felled and is now ready for replanting in the spring
we've seen a decline in forestry there are fewer people in it it was on the way down well that's certainly not the way that i see it
well you couldn't have a better day could you back at kew george i grow tree collections i grow all these species we can see here as individuals in an arboretum but do you see these trees being an important economic resource in the future is it optimistic the future for forestry
i'm very optimistic about the future and it's particularly important in scotland and wales these areas where the trees grow best whether we like it or not we're moving away from having to use non renewable materials because we're using them up and the energy cost of creating them is huge compared to the simple matter of growing trees
so forestry is on the up it certainly is from despair leaving the forest industry we've come to woodlands and we've seen woodlands still being used commercially seen it used for wildlife and more so recreation and jon doesn't want to leave the woods until he's sampled the latest attraction and rather him than me
this is the way to do a forest i'm not quite sure about it but we're going to go
next time tony and jon hit the water on a very special tree planting assignment jon dresses up to tackle some dangerous customers
do i look like a spaceman
b. b. c. young musician of the year is the most established and prestigious contest for young classical performers in britain today the competition is divided into five categories string woodwind brass percussion and keyboard the young musicians perform in front of an audience and a panel of judges who have the power to transform one of their lives forever
at this stage we're looking for one finalist who'll stand up with the b. b. c. national orchestra of wales in the millennium centre in front of a huge audience and they need to really captivate and really sell the piece that they're playing so we're looking for that spark
last night seventeen year old jim molyneux was picked to represent the percussion category he joins trombonist peter moore guitarist jadran duncumbe and flautist david smith tonight four keyboard finalists will battle it out for the last place in the grand final
i feel really privileged to have got this far and yes i'm really excited
i'm not worried about the outcome i'll just treat it as a performance
to have reached this stage i'm really really pleased to be here
and the winner of the keyboard category will go on to the grand final where five hopefuls will battle it out until one is crowned b. b. c. young musician of the year two thousand eight after months of auditions and performances the final four keyboard players have just been announced they now face weeks of intense work to prepare for the keyboard final from which only one of them will emerge with the chance to become young musician of the year
winning the piano finals would mean a lot not only because i'd feel like i've done very well i've beaten off a lot of other pianists to do that but also because i'd have that chance to perform with very good musicians
i mean it'll be very difficult to get through but obviously that's what i'm really looking to do
i'm gonna thank them even if i'm nowhere near a piano it's just kind of yeah it's like looming ominously
it would be the biggest step forward for me next in my career
seventeen year old sam law lives in county antrim northern ireland piano playing to sam is more than just about the music it almost defines his personality
i am actually quite a reserved person i feel that music is my voice and whatever feeling i want to express whether sadness or joyfulness or happiness i find it easy to express it through the music i started playing piano at the age of six and i remember the very first concert i went to which was right here in the town hall the pianist finghin collins who was giving a recital here one of the pieces he played was the prokofiev sonata his performance really amazed me because of the beautiful sound he was making through the grand piano at that point i realised that i wanted to take up the piano as well
sam's been spending a lot of time going over the detail of the pieces he'll be playing in the category final
the rachmaninoff sonata no two it is full of passion the piece but later on it begins to calm down very lyrical and very sweet music can describe things that words can't when i'm playing i'm thinking in my head about the music what i want to display
sam parles moi de l'importance de la musique pour toi
j'adore la musique classique parce que c. a. me permet de me detendre
sam is studying for his a levels including several languages at the local school
i always have the feeling that i'm struggling for recognition
my schoolwork is quite demanding i usually have lots of homeworks to do it's hard it just takes a lot of work but usually i get there
in ipswich eighteen year old erdem misirlioglu is the oldest of the finalists he's already been playing keyboards for twelve years and his first piano certainly wasn't a steinway
you get it to play demo things you could pretend to play it to people and they'd believe you the harpsichord is only supposed to be about this big but you've got a whole piano you'd never get a harpsichord playing down there or up here it doesn't sound like a harpsichord it's pretty rubbish isn't it
curiously erdem has already won young musician of the year well in a manner of speaking
rotary club of harlow young musician of the year two thousand five it's not the b. b. c. thing so
to get through to the b. b. c. young musician of the year grand final erdem's performance will have to stand up to the intense scrutiny of the judges with just weeks to go there's a lot of practice to put in
you can't just play aimlessly every time i sit down i say right i'm gonna do this in this session in a concert you can probably be more flamboyant you can get away with a lot more in terms of mistakes in a competition you know there are people watching every single note that you play you can't take risks
it's half term for eighteen year old kausikan rajeshkumar the piano's been a passion for kausikan ever since he can remember
kausikan is the only one of our keyboard finalists who goes to a specialist music school in his case the prestigious purcell school in hertfordshire
it kind of changed the face of music for me it became something much bigger it became a world it became connections with other people
seven a m. in ayrshire scotland the youngest of our four finalists sixteen year old michael foyle starts his journey to school
yep the only scottish one i think actually
do scotland proud
better than at the rugby anyway mainly the type of music i listen to is classical music but i also do a wee bit of jazz improvisation so it's not something i'm totally opposed to this is wellington school which is the school i've been to since i was five years old we're right on the south coast of ayrshire
as well as all of michael's musical activities at school his next round of prelim exams fall the same week as the young musician keyboard finals
it's quite a lot of pressure i think some of my peers are focussing entirely on the exams in a way i feel that's something that i should be giving my priority to
but i'm not letting that interfere with the music in the sense that it's eliminating all the music from my life you know
choose a poem that tells a story of an event a character or an incident
i've always found the balance that's allowed me to do enough of school and enough of music
and what is significant about lewis that we've talked about
it's the calvinistic faith great
very strong calvinist religion
always music has been the passion
you've got to convey a passion for the poem
my mind is constantly filled with music of all different types and thinking about music and just enjoying music the whole time in all sorts of different ways you have to be incredibly passionate and dedicated to put in the work that's required
with the category finals approaching michael's taking a quicker lunch than usual today
the next train to depart from platform four a. seven fifty service to london liverpool street
early every saturday morning erdem makes the journey from ipswich to london for his piano lesson at the guildhall school of music
i'm really bad at getting up in the mornings but i've got to do it it's a regular journey for me i've got used to it over the last few years the category finals for the b. b. c. young musician of the year that's what we're going to be working on today as the competition is next week so that's the priority at the moment it's always going to be the teacher that's the most important thing for a student when they're learning i've been with mark for five years now mark's just brought me on so much just hopefully in the next five years i can make the same amount of progress that's the exciting thing
good he learns pieces very quickly prepares very well now and i think he enjoys playing in the end i think in this piece cos it's your first piece you have to be very calm at the beginning and wait for silence in the hall there's a time limit as well isn't there
cos i used to do that but that's a bit risky yeah
well i can only stretch half that so i can't show you it looks a bit sort of casual doesn't it as he's matured his playing's got better very advanced actually for his age keep it going keep the line going i've got every faith in him so in the end i'll sit back and just enjoy it
i hope you do
with less than two weeks to go before the final kausikan prepares for the day's practice
we have three pianos we have a steinway as well steinway grand it's in our garage which is a bit odd but we don't have space for it in here here's my piano this is a really bad one you can have a look at it this is where all the ivory came off so it's not so great while i was playing it just came off it's really out of tune there's one that's quite bad isn't it so that's why i kind of rejected this piano and opted for a steinway grand instead yeah so this is also this piano is obviously not so old so some notes aren't even working like that one these notes are the notes one practise the most because one of my pieces like there's a climax with that note so it's always so bad cos it goes which doesn't really sound so great and then my other piece which is prokofiev which doesn't sound so bad there because i'm playing it so much i think
this isn't the first time kausikan has taken a shot at becoming young musician of the year at the most recent contest in two thousand six he was also among the last four pianists
sam meanwhile is seeking inspiration for his category final performance
when i'm playing i try to forget surroundings and think about what the piece is about and what pictures in the piece and what feeling they have they allow you to express it as art in front of the audience i think once you're in it it's much easier and it all comes out in the music and then after i finish i stay in that feeling for a while before it disappears then once it disappears that's like the performance is over this competition has been one that i've always dreamed of entering since i was young we are on the way to dublin where i often have my lessons in the royal irish academy of music i go there about once every week or every fortnight
after a three hour train journey sam arrives in dublin for his lesson
my teacher doctor john o'connor has a lot of experience in putting people in for competitions
erdem is preparing for the day's piano practice
sometimes i feel like i've got a mild form of obsessive compulsive things sometimes like theres things you've got to do before a performance i click every finger i soak my hands in hot water to get the blood flowing a bit and to get it warmed up
with the category final next week erdem's presentation has fallen behind
i didn't start preparing till about a week ago i've done a little every day which leaves me only three days to actually focus completely on the b. b. c. programme everything's quite last minute i'm going to have to work through the night probably a few days before the competition
but after a few hours' practice erdem takes a break to see his friends
he's naturally good at everything he's one of those guys who picks something up and they're naturally good at it
he hasn't been for months and he came the other day and beat me if you beat him once he'll let you stop playing it's frustrating when he gets ahead he sort of rubs it in a bit just to frustrate you more so he wins easier his dedication to music is unbelievable
he puts emotion into the pieces he plays so you feel what he's trying to put across when he plays it best guy in the world to win young musician of the year
michael's piano lesson is in glasgow over an hour away by train
pianists are out on a limb a wee bit in that they don't have a regular attendance in orchestra and are possibly more reclusive and antisocial than the rest of them socially stunted i think
you are now approaching glasgow central please mind the gap when alighting from this train'
the young musician of the year wasn't something i'd considered entering then when i went in for it i had more idea of what the standard was it's a very high standard since i started the competition nearly a year ago the way i've progressed with my playing has been quite dramatic you have these deadlines to work for and you naturally raise your game
one more time could you stretch so much you're almost almost in pain through stretching so put yourself at maximum stretch one more time we're working on developing his ability to use the instrument and the colours that it has' and the emotional side of the performance he could do it tomorrow but we're working to something very special i think he's going to peak just at the right time
with the final now just two days away kausikan takes a break to see some friends
there's kind of the stereotype that pianists are slightly odd emotionally stunted people who shut themselves in practice for eight hours a day hello i'm the antithesis of that really shall we go the b. f. i. cafe yeah i love competitions in a way cos he always wins them that's why no but it's i dunno whenever i enter competitions it's been an adventure
are you looking forward to it yeah i really am
it should be really like really fun
the important thing to you should be how you play not how far you get
i don't think it's because the piano is different from the violin that like that pianists are more academic in their approach i think it's because pianists are just essentially better obviously
obviously
it's the morning of the competition and our four finalists begin to arrive
i feel absolutely delighted and i feel really privileged to have got this far and yes i am really excited
sam gets straight down to some last minute practice
being a finalist hasn't really dawned on me yet it hasn't affected me in any way i'm just going to treat the competition as another performance hopefully the audience will enjoy it we'll see what happens the outcome won't bother me that much
erdem though has something to sort out before he can start practising
aaargh answering machine
it seems he's missing something vital for tonight's performance
mark was supposed to bring my shoes over to the college all right bye
kausikan is the only one of our finalists who's been here before
just try being freer after you've done
for michael it's been a very trying couple of days food poisoning has seen him laid up in his hotel
the last day i've been completely ill i think i vomited about ten times yesterday which wasn't ideal the day before the competition
that's quite different that'll work on that piano
i was in bed the whole day i'm still pretty weak today but i'm fairly confident the adrenalin will take over and do what it needs to do
and erdem finally gets down to some practice
bye bye sometimes i just practise just to get the notes right which is obviously good in the last few days i've been striving to make it sound better rather than just be more accurate i'm not counting on winning a competition to bring me international fame or something yeah in fact i'm not counting on anything to bring me international fame
sam's starting to make the final preparations for his performance
i'm a bit nervous yes but i'm trying to just think about the music and about what i want to achieve with my playing
erdem has just remembered something he needs to do before the performance
i should stick the photocopy of the music together because they're all loose at the moment in an ideal world i would have prepared more but i'm ready enough to give it my best shot i don't think it's a very good thing to be doing before i go on i should have done it last night but i fell asleep
for michael it's these last minute preparations that really count
all that you do in the weeks running up to it actually comes down to what you do in the stage right before you go on just making sure you're warmed up not just physically but also mentally that you're fired up
erdem's family have arrived en masse to give him support
you all right you do realise that if you get through tonight
you're gonna get the biggest cheer are you missing black shoes yes he forgot the shoes
put that away please
five minutes to go and kausikan who's on first tonight is called down
is it twenty five past yes
but theres one final warm up kausikan has to do on his way the judges arrive as kausikan nervously waits to go on
it's really subjective at this stage they're like the gods who decide our fate
it's quite an isolated life as a concert pianist practising and it's more intimate and i think we're looking to be drawn in to the performance we're looking for perfection we're really looking to be drawn in and we're looking to be sold the music
tonight's expert panel of judges is composer and conductor ben foster renowned pianist lucy parham and one of britain's most prolific recitalists martin roscoe
his performance was very mature i thought even the way he sat at the piano the way he waited before he started and then to go in to this late chopin nocturne with a maturity beyond his years he had a beautiful tone
he captured the nobility of the music very well he had a flexibility which was very natural for me there were some highlights i thought the ravel was beautiful he had a lovely character
also the audience were particularly drawn to him there was something about the space in his playing that made us listen to him it's hard to be the first competitor and he really achieved that
and the prokofiev was delivered with a lot of character and panache real panache
for me he made the piano sing the most tonight
as kausikan is performing michael is called down
the middle just went i forgot that it's fifteen minutes
michael it's your fifteen minutes now come on in
good luck yeah cheers it's one of the weirdest experiences i've had i don't know if it was good or not ugh that's really annoying actually
but a bit of nervous energy is always quite good michael's was a very thrilling start and a great piece great fun
he didn't take me on the journey of this island no this orgiastic island i was disappointed it was well dispatched but that was such a chance to draw us in
i think maybe he isn't quite as finished as the others tonight
sam is on next although his family couldn't make it over from northern ireland he's not alone
my family is not able to come i'm a bit disappointed that they can't come but my two vice principals from my school ballymena academy they're coming to support me i feel a bit nervous but i think in the healthy way because you need to have a certain amount of nervousness i think that gets you focussed into the music sam good luck thank you
good luck thank you
it was fun while it lasted we were just saying how quickly it goes and it's roasting in there
let's move on to sam if we may i thought his playing is incredibly natural i think it's sensitive and intelligent and technically he managed to make the piano they're all working on the same piano he made it shine for me there was a brilliance to his tone
for me sam went beyond technical ability there were some real moments of insight he was involved in the music it seemed to be very natural
i wanted much more of a rhetorical opening to the liszt again he was playing it quite inwardly to himself so i wanted more projection from him
technically the best thing we've heard from any of them
it was just amazing and i enjoyed showing off the last piece
erdem is on last though for him the nerves don't seem to have kicked in yet
heart hasn't started yet it's beating but it's not anything other than normal
good luck have fun erdem
cheers you want to look confident you want the audience on your side you don't want them to be nervous when you're playing and that can just be done by coming out and looking confident
our last competitor tonight erdem was a very stylish and confident performer his choice of the bach adagio at the beginning was very brave i thought
very brave
it could have gone wrong but it didn't
he had tremendous control of the tempo and the sound he must have huge hands because i was looking at the score there and
didn't break any of those chords
that's right i've got big hands but i couldn't stretch those he controlled it beautifully for me the rachmaninoff started in a rather majestic way rather than a passionate way i actually wrote that down on my form but then he really delivered the passion at the climax
i thought he had a real sense of architecture in the piece as well the line i thought was excellent in the rachmaninoff
it seemed a very personal performance to him although he involved his audience he brought the listener in i felt it was very concentrated i liked his style i liked the way he sat i like the way he moved he seemed very overwhelmed by the music which was selling it to me
he is in his own world but he invites you to enter that world so that's unusual i didn't hear that from any of the others
do you think he played to his full ability tonight i felt there was a little more he could have given perhaps if he'd chosen different pieces
he's a very thoughtful player though isn't he i think there's a real musician's brain at work there
absolutely certainly yeah
how was it
hot like you said
hot i'm red hot
we have to start thinking about who might be our winner tonight lucy we've talked it through is it any clearly in your mind who that might be
the competitors wait with their friends and family
you did very well
i have to say at the moment i'm feeling torn
no no it was beautiful it really brought everybody in
sam's performance moved and involved me more more than any actually really yeah although i did see a potential in erdem
they were all lovely very talented obviously love their music i know my boy does
there's something significant to say about all the performers in terms of communication with the audience how they use the dramatic moments between the pieces it's a very difficult decision to make i think he ought to win today
i think he ought to win today looking at all the performers that's my personal belief
there's always room for disagreement on these occasions a lot of it is very subjective mm
as the judges continue their last minute deliberations our four competitors gather to await the result
thanks ladies and gentlemen it's my great pleasure to announce that the winner of the keyboard category final and the person going forward to the grand final of the b. b. c. young musician of the year two thousand eight is erdem misirlioglu well done blimey see you obviously didn't play that badly
you look stunned
i am pretty stunned i don't know what to say
well done my lovely thanks
well i'm looking forward to may now really looking forward to may
he just stood out he had something special tonight it was really really good it was about the programme choice actually as much as anything it was a good choice it enabled us to see all the different sides to your character it worked very well it was a good gamble if it was a gamble it paid off
so eighteen year old erdem misirlioglu from ipswich will represent the keyboard category in the young musician of the year grand final erdem will be taking on four other finalists at wales millennium centre and will soon have to start work in preparation but tonight is for celebrations our five finalists will be competing against each other in the grand final this weekend it may be an all male line up but it's going to be one of the most exciting young musician competitions ever on monday we met eighteen year old david smith from edinburgh who became the first finalist beating off some strong competition to win the woodwind category
i never found anything that i really wanted to do until i started playing the flute
he's only been playing for four years but has a unique choice of style
how often do you hear someone scream down a flute
on the night david's performance astounded the judges and tested his technique to the limit
he's amazing great fingers great sound
david has a philosophical approach to the competition but is still determined to get through
yow i'm just thinking about playing as well as i can play if you think about it determined to get through then you're not going to get through and if you don't get through you're going to be completely gutted
representing the strings category eighteen year old guitarist jadran duncumb was next to go through
i didn't really expect to get this far and well i didn't know what to expect so it's been a really nice surprise
jadran based in norway is the only competitor to live abroad he's been playing the guitar since he was eight years old
now basically all i want to do is play as well as i can then whatever happens i will satisfied with my achievement
the final piece of jadran's programme delighted both the audience and the judges
that was a spark of genius to put that in
can he repeat this level of performance at sunday's grand final next up trombonist peter moore charged his way through to win the brass category at just twelve years old peter's the youngest of our young musicians left in the competition he wanted to play the trombone from a very early age and is already sure that he wants to take it further
the judges were amazed by the quality and maturity of peter's playing
i was just mesmerised i saw a tear yeah come on yeah i have to admit
peter's in with a chance of becoming the youngest player ever to win the title of b. b. c. young musician of the year
i don't feel like the youngest competitor at all really i feel just equal to the rest of them we're all looking forward to it
the fourth finalist to get through was seventeen year old jim molyneux from lancashire two pieces jim played for the judges were his own work
if you're playing other people's pieces it's hard to bring across what the composer wanted whereas if you're from the composer's point of view you know exactly want to play and how you want to play it
jim took up percussion when he was just seven and has since gone on to join a number of bands the magnitude of the competition has made a lasting impression on jim
it probably still hasn't hit me and still won't hit me for a few years how big this is really but yeah it's a nice feeling
technically he was really sound but he had time within what he was doing to show us more about himself
so will jim be able to impress the judges enough this weekend and as we've seen tonight eighteen year old erdem misirlioglu is the last of our competitors to go through to the grand final
if i was to have that title of young musician of the year the most important thing would be for that not to get to my head if that got to my head i've heard about it happening before i've seen it people who win competitions they think they've done very well and they they stop working so hard i think it's really important to carry on working and improving and understanding that you've always got so much to learn so winning the title would be very nice but i'd still know that i've got a very long way to go
yeah police yeah i need to get a train stopped it's the eurostar out of saint pancras yes of course i know what i'm saying lucy lucy
he'll do it anyway what wherever i go he'll be there he won't let me go not unless i make him see that i'm serious lucy
lucy
i'm getting on that train dad it's my choice and you cannot stop me please leave me alone

you say the word and i'm to take my kit off
more than i managed on our date i thought this was professional hi
don't seem too surprised to see me
course i am it's just wow
dad call you and tell you i was back
yeah
ian come away i'm just looking no you're spying on her
you know what she said she's not the same person
she's been goodness knows where for two months
with goodness knows who she's home now i wanna know where she's been what's she's been doing
there's things i'd like to know too like about steven what's happened with him where is he
so where have you been what have you been doing your dad didn't ask me to find out i just i'm your friend luce i used to be anyway
you still are so
dad
not here get inside
what're you doing running off like that you nearly gave us a heart attack liam
what's the point what it don't matter what i say it won't make any difference about what
is it cos tony's not here cos if it is he'll be home soon and we'll be a family again
liam or maybe it's living at nana pat's
that's not forever either we'll have a place of our own soon
oh why don't you let him actually speak i am trying to help
i don't like school is that it
who does oh bianca
i didn't do their stuff at my old school they're all gonna think i'm stupid
anyone calls you stupid i'll sort them out you've just got to stick up for yourself that's all
fractions fractions never understood them when i was at school we had maths every friday i dreaded it every time the teacher use to speak about fractions of this bits of that i'd start sweating
i go to the toilet when i don't understand something
look if it gets too bad you come and talk to me yeah
i will dad thanks
so now what's happening
she's never been right about anything why'd you do it to us steven
why'd you say those things to lucy
i was just trying to get her away from here she'd have been better off that way
or did you think you'd be better off more attention on you one less kid around
i was doing it for her you said something to me in the flat
something you reckoned your mum had said at least that was your story everything i touch turns bad i take something good and i choke the life out of it but that's you isn't it you take something good and you destroy it just like your mother did
i told you before don't talk about her like that
sometimes she had a reason other times she just did it for the hell of it
actually you're right i've not been thinking straight the last few days i haven't really known what i've been doing
well i've been thinking straight and now i'm seeing clearly and if you ever ever come near this square again you're not getting rid of me if you come near my family you can't i will swear on anything you wanna put in front of me i will kill you
you never give up on your kids you said that yourself to lucy
but they've given up on you don't you understand that lucy she can't bring herself to say your name peter how do you think he's gonna feel when he finds out what you did he's gonna see what i'm seeing what lucy saw what jane's seen all along
you're wrong it's not like that i'm not like that
there's something in you something i can't put right something that'll probably never ever be put right and i'm not gonna spend one more second trying
all that with lucy i made a mistake that's all
and you're right i will never give up on my family but you're not my family are you you are your mother's son you are simon's son and that was a time in my life when that really used to hurt me not any more i just thank god that i never produced something as sick and twisted as you i dunno what to say

you've sealed off the tunnel why did you do that they were trying to kill us but they've got my friend collateral damage

don't know it's not been assigned
well if you don't know that what do you know how to fight nothing else the machine must embed military history and tactics
but no name she's a generated anomaly
generated anomaly jenny rated well what about that jenny
jenny yeah i like that jenny
it's not what i'd call natural parenting rubbish you can't extrapolate a relationship from a biological accident er child support agency can just because i share physiological traits with simian primates doesn't make me a monkey's uncle does it
i'm not a monkey or a child
so where are we what planet's this messaline well what's left of it
six hundred sixty three seventy five deceased generation six thousand six hundred seventy one extinct generation six thousand six hundred seventy two forty six deceased generation six thousand six hundred eighty fourteen deceased
found in the western tunnels i'm told with no marks there was an outbreak of pacifism in the eastern zone three generations back before we lost contact is that where you came from eastern zone yeah i'm the doctor this is donna and i'm jenny don't think you can infect us with your peacemaking we're committed to the fight
i can't stay anyway gotta go and find my friend
that's not possible all movement is regulated we're at war
yes i noticed with the hath
back at the dawn of this planet these ancient halls were carved from the earth our ancestors dreamt of a new beginning a colony where human and hath would work and live together
so what happened the dream died broken along with hath promises
they wanted it all for themselves but the early pioneers fought back they used the machines to produce soldiers instead of colonists and began this battle for survival
there's nothing but earth outside why's that why build underground the surface is too dangerous then why build windows and what does this mean
how long's this war gone on for longer than anyone can remember
countless generations marked only by the dead
what fighting all this time because we must
every child of the machine is born with this knowledge it's our inheritance it's all we know how to fight and how to die
right so we're here
does this show the entire city including the hath zones yes why well it'll help us find martha we've more important things to do
the progenation machines are powered down but we could breed a whole platoon from you two i'm not having sons and daughters by some great big machine sorry no offence but you're not real
you're no better than him i have a body i have a mind i have independent thought how am i not real what makes you better than me
well said we need more like you if ever we're to find the source
ooh the source what's that then i like a source what is it
the breath of life and that would be
in the beginning the great one breathed life into the universe then she looked at what she'd done and she sighed she i like that
right so it's a creation myth it's not myth it's real that sigh
it was caught and kept as the source it was lost when the war started but it's here somewhere whoever holds the source controls the destiny of this planet ah
i thought so there's a suppressed layer of information in this map if i can just
what is it see a whole complex of tunnels hidden from sight hold on look
that must be the lost temple the source will be inside you've shown us the way and we're closer than the hath it's ours
that's a new map there's a different set of tunnels
tell them to prepare to move out we'll progenate new soldiers on the morning shift then we march once we reach the temple peace will be restored at long last
if you really wanted peace couldn't you just stop fighting only when we have the source
it'll give us the power to erase every stinking hath from the face of this planet
a second ago it was peace in our time now you're talking genocide
for us that means the same thing then you need a better dictionary
i am not his woman w. we're not a couple come on this way i'm going to stop you cobb
i have an army and the breath of god on my side what'll you have this lock them up what about the new soldier can't trust her she's from pacifist stock take them all
but i didn't do anything i think i just started a war more numbers they've gotta mean something
makes as much sense as the breath of life story
you mean that's not true
no it's a myth isn't it doctor
yes but there could be something real in that temple something that's become a myth a weapon
so the source could be a weapon and we've given directions to captain nutjob oh yes not good is it
we need to get out of here find martha and stop cobb from slaughtering the hath what what are you what are you staring at
you keep insisting you're not a soldier but look at you drawing up strategies like a proper general
you've got a weapon it's not a weapon you're using it to fight back i'm gonna learn so much from you you are such a soldier donna will you tell her
oh you are speechless i'm loving this you keep on jenny doctor martha you're alive oh am i glad to hear your voice are you all right
that's the woman from the machine the soldier my daughter except she isn't anyway where are you
what do you want me to do just stay where you are but i can help doctor doctor
the doors that have been closed will be open to us now the door to the temple to the source and to victory come the dawn cycle we march
they're getting ready to move out we have to get past that guard
i can deal with him no no you're not going anywhere what
you belong here with them she belongs with us with you she's your daughter she's a soldier she came out of that machine i know have you got that stethoscope
give it to me come on
what're you doing it's all right just hold still
come here listen and then tell me where she belongs
what do you call a female time lord what's a time lord it's who i am
it's where i'm from and i'm from you you're an echo that's all a time lord is so much more a sum of knowledge a code a shared history a shared suffering only it's gone now all of it gone forever
what happened
there was a war like this one bigger much bigger
and you fought and killed
yes
then how are we different
hey
i'm not supposed to talk to you i'm on duty i know

that's it jenny leave it let's go
you're a child of the machine you're on my side join us join us in the war against the hath it's in your blood girl don't deny it
jenny come on that's it hurry up no no no no the circuit's looped back
zap it back again the controls are back there
i'll have to manage on my own watch and learn father
no way that was impossible not impossible
just a bit unlikely brilliant you were brilliant brilliant
i didn't kill general cobb i could have but i didn't you were right i had a choice
spread out
i warned you cobb if the source is a weapon i'm gonna make sure you never use it
one of us is gonna die today and it won't be me
what no no no way no no we're friends that's all we're not even the same species there's probably laws against it
and what's it like the travelling
never a dull moment can be terrifying brilliant and funny sometimes all at the same time i've seen some amazing things though whole new worlds
oh i'd love to see new worlds
you will won't she doctor
do you think jenny'll see any new worlds
i suppose so
you mean you mean you'll take me with you we can't leave you here can we thank you thank you thank you come on let's get a move on careful there might be traps
kids they never listen oh i know that look see it a lot round our way blokes with pushchairs and frowns you've got dad shock
dad shock sudden unexpected fatherhood
take a bit of getting used to no it's not that well what is it then having jenny in the tardis is that it what's she gonna do cramp your style like you've got a sports car and she'll turn it into a people carrier
donna i've been a father before what i lost all that a long time ago along with everything else
i'm sorry i didn't know why didn't you tell me you talk all the time but you don't say anything
i know i'm just when i look at her now i can see them the hole they left all the pain that filled it i just don't know if i can face that every day
it won't stay like that she'll help you we both will
but when they died that part of me died with them it'll never come back not now
i tell you something doctor something i've never told you before i think you're wrong
they've blasted through the beams time to run again love the running yeah love the running
we're trapped can't be this must be the temple
this is a door
and again we're down to one to two now i've got it
i can hear them nearly done
these can't be a cataloguing system they're getting closer get back they're too similar too familiar not yet now
got it
they're coming close the door that was close no fun otherwise
it's not what i'd call a temple
it looks more like fusion drive transport
it's a spaceship
the original one the one the first colonists arrived in
could be but the power cells would have run down after all that time this one's still powered up and functioning come on
it's the hath that door's not gonna last much longer if general cobb gets through down there war's gonna break out
it is the original ship what happened
phase one construction they used robot drones to build the city
but does it mention the war final entry
mission commander dead still no agreement on who should assume leadership hath and humans divided into factions that must be it a power vacuum the crew divided into two factions and turned on each other start using the progenation machines and you've got two armies fighting a never ending war
two armies who are now both outside look at that
it's like the numbers in the tunnels
it's the new byzantine calendar
the codes are completion dates for each section they finish it they stamp the date on so the numbers aren't counting down they're going out from here day by day as the city got built
yes oh good work donna
yeah but you're still not getting it the first number i saw back there was six thousand twelve oh seven seventeen well look at the date today
oh seven to twenty four no
what does it mean seven days that's it
seven days just seven days
what d'you mean seven days seven days since war broke out
this war started seven days ago just a week a week
they said years no they said generations
if they're all like you products of those machines
all the buildings they're in ruins
doctor martha
i should've known you wouldn't stay away from the excitement
that's the general we haven't much time
we don't know what we're looking for is it me or can you smell flowers
yes bougainvillea i say we follow our nose
blocks seven to ten advance
with me oh yes yes isn't this brilliant
is that the source
it's beautiful
what is it
terraforming it's a third generation terraforming device
so why are we suddenly in kew gardens
because that's what it does all this only bigger much bigger it's in a transit state producing this must help keep it stable before they finally stop hold your fire
what is this some kind of trap
you said you wanted this war over i want this war won you can't win no one can you don't even know why you're here your whole history it's just chinese whispers getting more distorted the more it's passed on this is the source this is what you're fighting over a device to rejuvenate a planet's ecosystem it's nothing mystical it's from a laboratory not some creator it's a bubble of gases a cocktail of stuff for accelerated evolution methane hydrogen ammonia amino acids proteins nucleic acids it's used to make barren planets habitable look around you it's not for killing it's bringing life if you allow it it can lift you out of these dark tunnels and into the bright bright sunlight no more fighting no more killing i'm the doctor and i declare this war is over
what's happening
the gases will escape and trigger the terraforming process
what does that mean it means a new world no
jenny jenny talk to me jenny
is she gonna be all right
a new world it's beautiful
jenny be strong now you need to hold on d'you hear me we've got things to do you and me eh eh we can go anywhere everywhere you choose
that sounds good
you're my daughter and we've only just got started you're gonna be great you're gonna be more than great you're gonna be amazing you hear me jenny two hearts two hearts she's like me if we wait if we just wait
there's no sign doctor there's no regeneration she's like you but maybe not enough
no too much that's the truth of it she was too much like me i never would have you got that i never would when you start this new world this world of human and hath remember that make the foundation of this society a man who never would
it's happening the terraforming
build a city nice and safe underground strip away the top soil and there it is and what about jenny
let us give her a proper ceremony i think it would help us please
jenny was the reason for the tardis bringing us here it just got here too soon which then created jenny in the first place paradox an endless paradox time to go home yeah
home
you sure about this
yeah positive i can't do this any more you'll be the same one day
not me never how could i ever go back to normal life after seeing all this i'm gonna travel with that man for ever
good luck and you
we're making a habit of this yeah
and you'd think it'd get easier all those things you've been ready to die for i thought for a moment there you'd finally found something worth living for
oh there's always something worth living for martha
bye doctor
goodbye doctor jones
hello boys
the shuttle jenny what're you doing come back sorry can't stop
what you gonna do tell my dad
planets to save civilisations to rescue creatures to defeat and an awful lot of running to do
agatha christie
what about her
that's me
noooooooo
murder chief inspector smith from scotland yard
known as the doctor miss noble is the plucky young girl who helps me
i say there's a murder a mystery and agatha christie
so it happens to me all the time
show yourself demon
there's nowhere to run
the thrill is in the chase never in the capture
oh my god
but he comes home each evening and he's ready with his gun so who do you think you are kidding mr. hitler if you think old england's done
right men this is top secret put the blackouts up woods meadows stand guard outside the main door there and don't let anybody in i don't care who it is right all clear out there hancock all clear sir good right jones all clear
right sir come on lads
excellent men very good turnout
sir aren't you going to wear your attire
no not for just now i shall just wear the hat now the reason i have taken all these pains to keep this matter a secret is because nobody must see this dance until it is perfect otherwise we might look like a bunch of idiots
captain mainwaring i want a word w. i. ye i've got to tell you sir that as a scot i feel a right jessie dressed up in this pansy sassenach get up
it's frightfully difficult getting about like this it really is most awkward
you'll soon get used to it really
mr. wilson isn't as other men his legs point in the wrong direction
what's the matter with them do try and sort yourself out well i haven't done it before thank you so much there you are
now as you can see sorry sir and during this week the people of walmington will be doing their utmost to raise this the climax is the procession on saturday when we'll do our dance wilson will collect money
he could say we need spitfires to beat the hun put money in my mouth and it goes to my tum rubbish all he's got to do is wave his stick and say give us your money or i'll bash your head in
all right now let's form up private sponge give the instruction book to sergeant wilson now where did we get to last time
i was having trouble whiffling sir
ah whiffling it's important that you understand this read that bit out wilson
just a minute sir here we are whiffling the movement of the whiffling stick is to frighten away evil spirits
away from what mr. mainwaring this is a fertility dance pike i don't think my sister dolly would approve ah you silly old duffer it's to encourage the crops to grow it's danced every year by the young fertile men of the village
it's not much good us doing it
you speak for yourself
all right that'll do
permission to speak sir i do not wish to stand opposite frazer when he's whiffling why not i've faced whirling dervishes and i've faced charging fuzzy wuzzies but i don't want to face him he's got a mad look in his eye
mad mad my eyes are perfectly sane captain mainwaring would you say i had mad eyes
well no not really mad
there
just before we start we'd better check that the bells are all right right left leg first right leg is that the best you can do
a touch of rheumatism i'm afraid
so sorry sir i beg your pardon do try and control that animal he's not used to this type of work
watch what you're doing
that was very good indeed right take a break and change into your uniforms jones jones jones what's all this nonsense about frazer hitting you with his stick that's not like you
i know it isn't i can't hide it i'm in a highly nervous state
have you got trouble at home no it's trouble away from home you'd better come in the office thank you sir
could mr. wilson come too sir why he's a man of the world very well
wilson
yes sir office do you want me to walk or gallop
just come in the office will you
that's very kind of you
now jones get this thing off my desk i'm terribly sorry sir it sort of sticks out jones
it's rather delicate it's mrs. fox mrs. fox yes she's a widow lady and we have an arrangement we've been walking out
walking where
i don't see what this has got to do with me
recently you see her affection has been taken by another who mr. gordon the town clerk
what not that silly bald headed old duffer i don't mean he's a bald headed old duffer just because he's got a bald head he'd be a silly duffer with hair a full head of hair yes all right all right
everybody knows he's a roue and a philanthropist what can i do i want you to speak to her sir
i couldn't possibly do that yes you must you must here's her telephone number
oh dear what are you going to do i don't know
i suppose i could ring her up perhaps i ought to point out to her what sort of a chap this clerk is i'll give her a ring later and arrange to see her
i'd hoped the place would be empty
don't worry sir nobody will know why you're meeting mrs. fox
it doesn't do for a man in my position to be seen in public with a flashy woman like mrs. fox in a small town like this tongues wag tongues wag
nobody will pay any attention now where shall we sit
i'm going to sit over here i see you go and sit on your own
psst mr. mainwaring good morning
jones don't give me away sir why are you dressed like that i'm heavily disguised
yoo hoo mr. mainwaring morning mr. frazer mr. godfrey hello mr. wilson i'm ever so sorry i'm late please i'm not usually late when i meet a gentleman friend but sit down
please sit down thank you
the reason i asked you to meet me is to what do you want pike excuse me but mrs. mainwaring's on the phone oh right tell her i'll ring back later will you
ring back later right
what is it now
good morning mrs. fox hello dear it's nice to see you
get out pike
bye bye dear
mrs. fox the reason i asked you to meet me here was to discuss a rather delicate matter
yes
the point is mrs. fox you're a very attractive woman
what was i saying
you were saying how attractive i was you're very attractive too
that's got nothing to do with it but you are you are yes well we won't argue about it the point is mrs. fox you have had mr. jones as an admirer for some time now and now you have another
mr. mainwaring oh see see there godfrey for goodness' sake they're playing handy pandy
being a public figure i expect this admirer is of great attraction
oh he is he is
yes whereas jones is just a simple butcher but he's a fine figure of a man mrs. fox a full head of fine distinguished grey hair while your new admirer not to put too fine a point on it is bald
mr. mainwaring you know what they say about bald headed men
no what do they say
well the thing is mrs. fox jones is a loyal member of my platoon and i don't want him hurt we won't hurt him mr. mainwaring we he can have mondays and saturdays and you can have tuesdays and fridays
i'm talking about mr. gordon the town clerk
he can have wednesdays
what do you want now pike sorry but mrs. mainwaring's on the phone
i said you were having coffee with mrs. fox but she still wants you
you stupid boy i tell you i've never been so shocked in my life that woman that frightful woman really thought i had amorous ideas
how awfully embarrassing for you
and when my wife rang up that stupid boy told her i was having coffee with mrs. fox all hell broke loose elizabeth wouldn't listen look what she did to my tie she rang the bank twelve times today if she rings tonight tell her i'm not here all right
good evening evening jonesy thank you for talking to mrs. fox i'm sure it had an effect it certainly had
captain mainwaring we can't get into the hall the door's locked mr. hodges told us to go away right you can come out now line up that's it there we are very nice that's it there we are then what do you think mr. town clerk oh they're very nice they are we've got to choose one of you to play lady godiva in the procession can we see the first one certainly on the horse dear
jones i want you to show the men how to strip down the lewis gun in two minutes i shall time you
uncle arthur what is it the hall is full of naked ladies
don't be silly frank pay attention to the lecture
it is come and have a look yourself good lord what next
good heavens
shall we tell mr. mainwaring
answer the phone wilson yes of course hurry you've only got thirty seconds hello yes just hold on a minute
it's mrs. mainwaring sir
i'm out
i'm sorry i'm afraid he's gone out yoo hoo mr. mainwaring i'm here
how dare you burst in on one of my lectures
i'm sorry i was just on my way to the hall excuse me boys mr. gordon let me in it's only little me good evening my dear come in
mr. mainwaring stop him stop him what's he doing in there mr. mainwaring i don't know jones but i intend to find out
what's the meaning of this buzz off napoleon i'm appalled vicar wilson wilson don't stare at the girls get them covered what with come away
all this fuss over a few silly girls if the vicar wants girls that's his affair mr. gordon shall i go and change into my swimming costume now i don't think i could stand the shock of course
he's doing it again stop him all right jones be quiet i demand an explanation
keep your hair on we're choosing a lady godiva for the procession
lady godiva yeah and it's better than your silly morris dancing
our dancing is not silly
is one of these girls going to ride naked through walmington
yes it's a tribute to the brave city of coventry the girl won't be bare of course she'll wear fleshings
fleshings
it's quite all right sir they're all over body tights
we're not living in victorian times mr. gordon might i have a word certainly my dear
he's doing it again stop him all right look here mr. gordon
just a moment mainwaring i think we have the solution you don't want a young girl to be lady godiva it's just been pointed out to me that lady godiva leofric was a woman of more mature years so in the course of historical accuracy i suggest that lady godiva should be mrs. fox quiet please quiet mrs. fox will be quite respectable covered from top to toe in fleshings and wearing a wig of long golden tresses you'll never cover her up with long golden tresses
yes elizabeth no elizabeth i had nothing to do with the choice of mrs. fox as lady godiva no dear yes dear it was the town clerk who decided she should be played by someone more mature somebody of rather more ample proportions yes i know that you have more ample proportions than mrs. fox but you're not lady godiva are you hello hello hello just chatting to the little woman
i see what little woman my wife
i've lost her since the town clerk asked mrs. fox to be lady godiva her head's been turned right round
i'm sorry
this is what comes of women interfering in men's affairs the platoon's been knocked sideways
mum we're about to go on parade go away frank evening captain mainwaring what's this about mrs. fox playing lady godiva it's nothing to do with me you were there
what yes i was i was standing around
you don't want to play lady godiva
i'd like to have been asked consider the effect on your son
his mother riding through the streets clad only in
fleshings
now are we ready men when the when the procession has gone past jones will open the door we will burst out on to the street and start our dance
mr. mainwaring the procession's coming now good good stand by
put that horse away it's frightfully heavy come along rest it on here
there's someone at the door don't they know we're closed i'm coming
wilson i want you to collect as much money as you possibly can
mr. jones mr. jones
mrs. fox what's the matter
it was terrible don't upset yourself you're with your little jack now what happened
what happened well i went to one of the rooms in the town hall to change
i put my wig and fleshings on a chair and went out of the room for a minute and when i came back they were gone gone gone what a pity we're not going to see lady godiva after all
it's up to us now men
there is a lady godiva
good lord it's not mavis is it i wish you'd control that woman
don't look don't look sir whatever you do don't look
it is mrs. mainwaring
oh mr. mainwaring speak to me come round come round poor man he'll never get over the shock
this week an out of control tardis lands our trio in the middle of a battle zone
why did you do that hold on
and we witness the birth of a new chapter in doctor who history
she's my daughter jenny it's a story about becoming a dad
what do you think dad
brilliant you were brilliant
so join confidential and find out who really is the daddy
careful there might be traps
it's possibly the coolest storyline ever
i'll have to manage on my own jenny watch and learn father
action
today the doctor who cast and crew are all set for a new arrival
arm yourself
where did she come from from me from you how who is she
she's my daughter
hello dad
big story big story for the doctor the title is the doctor's daughter
lo and behold jenny who is his daughter steps out of the machine
i think it's one of the best pre title sequences we've ever had
hello dad
lovely i think that's great georgia i think it's lovely and i love the smile it's really great
russell and julie and phil basically said the doctor's daughter then they all went ssh it's a big secret
penning the doctor's unplanned parentage was far from inconceivable but it is a script that leaves the unwitting father to be somewhat baffled
why would the tardis bring us here
donna the doctor and martha find themselves in an out of control tardis they can't tell where it's taking them when it lands they don't know where they are
i love this bit i thought you wanted to go home
i know but all the same it's that feeling you get like you swallowed a hamster there's these two colonies at war
stay where you are drop your weapons we're not armed
look no weapons we're safe
society has started to break down
what's going on leave him alone the two races have a way of replicating themselves to create more soldiers for their army
ah ah
and that is to progenate them which means a tissue sample is taken from a person and a new person is grown
something tells me this isn't about to check my blood pressure ah
what are you doing to him
everyone gets processed it's taking a tissue sample ow ow
ow ow ow ow ow and extrapolating it some kind of accelerator
are you all right what on earth
that's just
first of all you get a doctor who just wants nothing to do with her the c. s. a. would be chasing him across the galaxy not mine technically mine but not my responsibility in any way shape or form
she's a generated anomaly
generated anomaly gen er ated what about that jenny jenny
yeah i like that jenny
the doctor doesn't accept that she is his child at first can't extrapolate a relationship from a biological accident child support agency can just cos i share physiological traits with simian primates doesn't make me a monkey's uncle i'm not a monkey
or a child
a further complication to the doctor's relationship with his new daughter is that she is a warrior
every child of the machine is born with this knowledge it's our inheritance it's all we know
she's born to fight she's born to use weapons she's born to karate chop and kick her feet
oh i'm just a girl little old me don't let me out of your sight oh i'm just a girl
so the doctor's daughter fires her way onto our screens and into doctor who history
she comes out as a kind of manufactured soldier with a pre programming towards aggression and war
instant mental download of all strategic and military protocol generation five thousand soldier in peak physical health i'm ready
i'm just a girl
she's quite like a newborn child hello dad she has the skills to fight she knows that's what she should be doing
she's working on instinct a lot of the time her instinct is quite bolshy and in your face quite cheeky
hello boys
she's a soldier who finds every single rule of her life being challenged without ever backing down
why did you do that they were trying to kill us but they've got my friend collateral damage
she's one of the few people who can defend a soldier's viewpoint to the doctor
you keep insisting you're not a soldier but look at you drawing up strategies like a proper general
no i'm trying to stop the fighting isn't every soldier
she shuts him up she makes him speechless which donna loves
donna will you tell her
you are speechless i'm loving this you keep on jenny
the episode is a journey of her learning how to use her skills in the right way at the beginning she's completely let loose she has no boundaries time to run again love the running
don't
get down
so what does it take to turn actress georgia moffatt into g. i. jenny
when you fire it does that all right if i pass you the gun now that's it put your thumb through there there you go
oh i see hold your thumb down today i'm doing loading of guns and afterwards lots of firing of them which is great as i'd never have thought i'd hold a gun in my entire career
rather than use real guns with blank ammunition a gas firing gun we can fire this all day long so there'll be a lot more gunfire in this particular episode
there she is
i have no idea what they are maybe machine guns but they're awesome i want one
a bit further round and then sky your weapon so you're bang bang bang bang and down and then bang bang bang bang and then back down you know what i mean yep
i think i can do it it might all go dramatically wrong but
you'll be pointing at me then pointing at me at the end of that speech it's in your blood girl
it's always that responsibility with the fact of what you're messing with and constructing was this canonicity this back story of the daughter which you don't often get to tangle with
and what of the time lords
dead they burnt with you the end of the last great time war everyone lost
and also an awareness of the fact that you were starting to open up aspects of the doctor's past life we don't often get to discuss about his previous family that he had and lost in the time wars
my entire planet died my whole family do you think it never occurred to me to go back and save them in the current series once or twice we've had fleeting little mentions he said to rose in the tardis he'd been a father once
kids can't have it all their own way that's part of being a family what about trying to understand them easy for you to say you don't have kids
i was a dad once
what did you say
i think we're there
and now obviously this story it's not a natural biological daughter you could argue but this really brings him face to face with fatherhood
donna i've been a father before
what lost all that a long time ago
along with everything else
i'm sorry i didn't know
he's gonna have a mixture of complicated emotions when another member of that race or something closely akin to it pops out of a machine and i think that's an interesting emotional place for the character to go
come here listen and then tell me where she belongs
it came out of a desire to keep pushing david and to keep taking him in new directions and keep challenging him really
two hearts exactly what's going on
what's a time lord it's who i am where i'm from
to suddenly find himself with a member of family is one of the biggest challenges you could give him so i'm chuffed we did it
if you knew my story word for word
another memorable meeting came back in two thousand seven when david came face to face with his doctor
shabby looking thing
we were racking our brains about what to do for children in need russell said why don't we just maybe do two doctors
i would belong with someone like you
last year for children in need we did time crash written by steven moffat it had david tennant meeting peter davison in a brand new ten minute scene onboard the tardis which was delightful to work on
oh no no no no no no no no stop that stop it
right just settle down now come on
oh excuse me so sorry what what what
action
who are you
oh brilliant
i'm the doctor who are you
i phoned up peter and he was well up for it which i knew he would be because he and his kids are big fans of the new series i think he's desperate to qualify for his own top trumps card
a bit saggier than it should be hair's greyer that's because of me together we shorted out the time differential it should all snap back in place when we get you home
it was very strange to be coming back into doctor who i'd been asked a few months before by steven moffat if i'd be interested in doing it and i leapt at the chance just because i'm a great fan of the new series
never mind that look at you the hat the coat the crickety cricket stuff the stick of celery brave choice celery but fair play not a lot of men can carry off a decorative vegetable shut up
it's almost eye twisting to see the two of them together on the set
who are you take a look oh oh no
oh yes you're oh no here it comes yeah yeah i am
a fan but standing in that outfit on the new set i did feel slightly out of place it took me a little time to feel at home there but once we got into it i got quite into it
although he looks older he still looks like the doctor not everyone in their fifties looks like they did in their late twenties but he does he still looks like the same man
the cloister bell
yeah right on time that's my cue we're gonna detonate a black hole
strong enough to fly the entire universe it was terrific to do what can i say i thank you doctor thank you i'm very welcome
and cut thank you
when he finished his episode with david for children in need he rang me up and said right now it's your go
peter davison is georgia's dad there is clearly a very strong doctor who link there
keep quiet and open the door
the doctor donna and jenny are creeping undercover
she rang me up i remember her saying can i tell you my first line i said yeah go on then it's hello dad
hello dad my first line was hello dad and i was like oh my god
i thought that's a good start
i went to school with the daughter of colin baker as well and her dad was doctor who so i was under the impression everyone's dad was doctor who
no don't
it wouldn't have been interesting for the doctor to welcome her i wanted him to have a quite aggressive reaction against her
why did you do that they were trying to kill us but they've got my friend collateral damage
at least you've still got her he lost both his men i'd say you came out ahead her name's martha
i'm gonna find her
it's awful for him this daughter is everything he wouldn't be she's a soldier she's got military protocols downloaded into her brain she wants to fight that's the important thing and she thinks killing is fine
on set it's up to the special effects team to start this relationship off with a big bang
up to here here this one so this is the very beginning of the episode when obviously the humans have set the charges they're running away and the hath are coming
we have to blow the tunnel get the detonator
i'm not detonating anything
blow the thing martha no don't
the cast and crew prepare to feel the full force of danny's explosion
when we have to do a big explosion scene it's quite exciting when they clear the set and we realise oh god this really is quite a big deal because they just literally locked the camera off and everyone else left
i've got you martha develops a bond with the hath that she helps heal peck he's called he had a dislocated shoulder so she pops it back in and they become very good friends they've just kidnapped me and brought me here
yeah he has kidnapped you the only reason you're going to him is because he's groaning yes
is it your arm yeah he's half fish half humanoid is this a shoulder it may be dislocated so she doesn't really know keep still still yeah no move we had a paramedic on set who was advising us' how a shoulder pops in so i'm sure a shoulder is a shoulder maybe now this is gonna hurt one two three
i think martha's side of this adventure is a sweet one she lets us into a world that otherwise we wouldn't see and shows us the other side of the battle
now then i'm doctor martha jones who the hell are you
it's the hath get the detonator martha and the hath came out of the fact that we simply couldn't contain martha donna the doctor and jenny within the one storyline
we tell their story through her she becomes the person who uses her empathy to understand them and therefore we do she accepts the hath for what they are she isn't scared of them
it almost does remind her of the nice aspects of time travel it's up to you but nothing's gonna stop me time travel's not all plain sailing sometimes you end up in deep water
action after being blasted and freezing then i went into some quicksand being in that water was fine i had a wet suit on underneath all of my clothes
it's minus five and the cast and crew are braving the elements
they were warriors who looked like they'd kill her and then it unravelled that they're quite nice they're quite gentle they save her life rather than killing her
to actually play the scene it was just so sad for martha and for me because he's such a sweet character
you saved me i won't let you die
what are you doing helping you oh no no
it's a brilliant moment for martha i think you see her humanity and you see the pain that she feels really and why she can't keep personally travelling with the doctor because she sees that pain
i'm so sorry goodbye friend so it was really really sad that after martha had offered him to come on this adventure and broaden his horizons he ends up losing his life which is sort of directly her fault really and i think that for me playing the scene it was sad anyway cos it was just a miserable night all together
there was an outbreak of pacifism in the east three generations ago before we lost contact is that where you came from that's us i'm the doctor this is donna
the doctor has his own drawer full of double standards when it comes to er behaving as a soldier it's something that he clearly has done and on quite an epic scale
i got soul but i'm not a soldier i got soul but i'm not a soldier i got soul but i'm not a soldier i got soul but i'm not a soldier i got soul but i'm not a soldier i got soul but
that's brilliant
getting a taste for it doctor no no not at all not me
don't shoot
there's no such thing as a pacifist in a real universe i think
let me out of these manacles he will turn to violence if there's no other option
sometimes you have to fight a simple surrender is not enough
everything has its time and everything dies but he doesn't do it lightly and he doesn't do it with any joy he only does it for the greater good
i wanna stand up i wanna let go you know you know you know
no
another headache another heartbreak i'm so much older than i can take and my affection well it comes and goes i need direction to perfection no no no no
no second chances
help me please why should i you never did
i'm that sort of a man
there's always been a battle in the scripts and we talk about it as to how far the doctor will go what cost there is for the things that he does
empress of the rachnoss i give you one last chance
when he fought the empress of the rachnoss when he lost rose was absolutely bleak and desolate and he was committing genocide
there's always something interesting and contradictory about his anti violent message and his commitment to fight for what he believes in
there's a great warrior inside there he might hide it under that smile and the charm and the suits and the good looks there is a battler inside him he's won an awful lot of fights and is a good man to be on your side in a war so it's a tricky area
i've got soul but i'm not a soldier i've got soul but i'm not a soldier do it just do it if i don't like it it will stop
fascinating
as i was writing this and began to look at the back story and stuff we could draw on of course the realisation that effectively he was a foot soldier in the time wars and was at the centre of what must have been a massive epic slaughter
there was a war
like this one
bigger much bigger
and you fought and killed
yes exposure to violence can make you very abhorrent of violence that make sense we don't need any more dead it's them or us you don't have to kill them i'm trying to save you listen to me killing after a while it infects you once it does you're never rid of it we don't have a choice
it's interesting i think when he confronts jenny and challenges her predisposition towards being a warrior that she fronts him up i'm not doing anything you didn't do even if it was nine hundred years ago
oh i know that look see it a lot round our way blokes with pushchairs and frowns at first he's very reluctant to even acknowledge it let alone accept that this is his daughter you've got dad shock
dad shock unexpected fatherhood takes a bit of getting used to
donna adopts jenny really quickly and i think it's out of her sense of interest in what the relationship is to him
we're fine what about you
and jenny she's fine too yes all right and jenny
that's the woman from the machine the soldier my daughter except she isn't anyway where are you
it's amazing how strongly donna comes through she really finds her place as that voice that brings him down to earth
is she gonna cramp your style you've got a sports car she's gonna turn it into a people carrier
she's the voice of reason in his head
you're not going anywhere what you belong with them
she belongs with us with you she's your daughter
she's a soldier she came out of that machine oh yes i know that bit
she learns from the doctor and donna that actually the way that the way she fights and she doesn't control how she feels is not necessarily the right way it's a story of growth i guess
that's it hurry up oh no no it's back the sequence where jenny flips through the beams that are preventing them getting from one end of the corridor to the other was always in that script from the first draft really stephen greenhorn felt it very important in order to just be a very quick way of demonstrating
we were very careful to avoid the fact that she's not clone that she is her own person but you can see the doctorishness in her
watch and learn father
and you can see that the reason he would warm to her is he recognises elements in her that are strong in him as well
no way
it had to be storyboarded really carefully by alice she really had to work out how jenny should move through that path of light and how we could shoot that in the most economical way georgia did have some training we did need to see her start the movement off and you know do that final roll and kick that she does georgia's an actress she's not a gymnast and while she's really fit and really game we had to make her look like you know an olympic gymnast of the highest order we needed a body double so we had a body double who was a gymnast who does that fast back flipping costume and make up department had to make that lady look identical to jenny she's obviously not identical and the sequence moves so quickly that you'd blink and not know
really what i kind of want is if you do it once more here and then i get you here otherwise i'm gonna have to cut somewhere between the move
alice had a very specific way she wanted it to look she threw something at belinda this is fine i'll just do that
no pressure
we went through about five or six different routines before we hit on the last one all the special effects sequences are smoke and mirrors they're all but you can only do that so far and you need that shot of her starting and ending that action
i'm just doing that with my hand
start with them lower and use the momentum of pushing them up to start
belinda made it look so effortless literally two days of flipping down corridors that's incredible
i think you can go from a handstand into a forward roll you know i think before we start shooting i'll do it if you do it all right
we had about two days' rehearsal on it and i in the end i think i did a cartwheel and a flip from a crab to standing up position the rest of it i couldn't do it didn't look very cool it didn't look like it should
well i think that the end sequence stands up brilliantly it's as a result of that commitment
action
no way that was impossible not impossible just a bit unlikely brilliant you were brilliant
by the end of it they've both realised they want to be more like the other one and admire that in each other action
with the relationship between the doctor and jenny flipped on its head the future seems marvellous
oh yes isn't this brilliant
it was a fantastic location for this episode
is that the source
it's beautiful what is it terraforming
a terraforming device
it just gave us that feeling of another dimension especially when you've had a whole episode that has been subterranean where you've been in darkness it's been filled with war and violence and claustrophobia and then to come out into a beautiful beautiful green lush vibrant atmos phere is a whole part of the story's quest the journey they make
this is the source this is what you're fighting over a device to rejuvenate a planet's ecosystem it's nothing mystical it's from a laboratory not some creator i'm the doctor and i declare this war is over
what's happening the gases will escape and trigger the terraforming process
as soon as he looks like he's found somebody new to share his life with they've got to die or leave him
what does that mean it means a new world it it just comes out of the blue no it's not expected
jenny jenny talk to me jenny if i should die this very moment i wouldn't fear for i've never known completeness like being here wrapped in the warmth of you loving every breath of you it's another tragedy another disappointment another heartbreak jenny be strong now you need to hold on do you hear me we've got things to do you and me eh eh we can go anywhere everywhere you choose
it sounds good
you're my daughter we've only just got started you're going to be great no you're gonna be more than great you're gonna be amazing jenny
wanna stay right here till the end of time
as soon as he accepts her as soon as the doctor opens his heart to her she's got to get shot in one of hers two hearts two hearts she's like me if we wait we just wait
there's no sign doctor there's no regeneration she's like you but maybe not enough
no to much
it was a really bizarre experience because it was definitely my favourite scene and yet it was the hardest one to play when you've got that person towering over you looking devastated by this you can't help i never planned to cry in it that wasn't a decision i made but it just happened the whole thing happened
i think the turning point of the scene when the doctor loses jenny we've seen him suffer loss before with rose and with the master
i love you
quite right too and i suppose rose tyler it can't end like this you and me all the things we've done remember the axons and the daleks no
he's in a situation where when he picks up the gun and points it at cobb's head that's quite unusual for him to even threaten violence
i never would
when he picks up a weapon that was discussed at some length it was such an extraordinary thing for him to do
have you got that i never would
now it's like we're seeing a man who's equally had a loss and is equally distraught but is sort of somehow stronger even when he points the gun at cobb's head you couldn't seriously argue he's about to kill him he's using anger to make a statement to the whole society around him it's not just a hollow gesture
make the foundation of this society a man who never would
the tremendous moment of setting the foundation for the entire planet of messaline he's an extraordinary man who else could do that but he takes the most personal moment and makes it a statement of liberty of proper moral worth so it's amazing hello boys
what's interesting is she's still there at the end of the show
come back sorry can't stop what you gonna do tell my dad
i wonder if that will become important in doctor who history
where are you going
i've got the whole universe planets to save civilisations to rescue creatures to defeat and an awful lot of running to do
it does leave a lot of ends untied doesn't it
only you ou ou can make this world seem right
we got company
only you
and we said sure the cars weren't terribly well built and quite a lot of bits fell off but we insisted that some of the designs were quite clever
there was a really big argument which ended up with the people in the office saying to us if you think b. l. made a decent car you go out and buy one they gave us each one thousand two hundred of our own money and then set us a number of challenges we were told to meet up at the warwick services on the m. forty and jeremy was first to arrive
theme from the new avengers
theme from the professionals the next contender arrived
wait there's a car arriving here with no one behind the wheel it must be hammond and it's a dolly sprint
what do you think yeah look at that first ever production car to have sixteen valves four per cylinder
wow and the first british saloon car to have alloy wheels as standard wow it's up there i seem to recall very sporty
real wood the only thing is they forgot to sand it you get splinters off it it's made out of floorboards it's unbelievable
how much did you pay of your own money
one thousand two hundred fifty so you've gone over because it's a classic it's desirable people want these things
i talked richard through the rover's little foibles' little known fact about the rover s. d. one is that it was longer on one side because it was not very well made than it was on the other engine good gearbox good clutch good
cos these had central locking electric windows didn't people used to get trapped in them and killed yeah
your dolly sprint was the hot hatchback of its day very much so so what's may got
theme from terry and june
morning and he's brought a piece of cheese
ho ho ho you've brought a princess james i have
james we're trying to prove that british leyland occasionally made good cars
you're not helping our case most interesting car they ever made and most radical and most modern oh look at the brown interior
brown brown brown it's brown and browner
brown was a seventies colour this is a nineteen seventy eight car it's very interesting why is it interesting this was the first car in the world to obscure its wiper spindles under the bonnet
obscured windscreen wiper spindles there's a reason to own one
at the time it was important
what's the suspension in this hydragas it was very very
james it's very low so it should be no it's collapsed it's very low on that side and very high
it's actually broken james it's leaked this car the dolly sprint was driven in the professionals this featured in the video of don't you want me baby by the human league this was driven by terry scott in terry and june i know enough said now at this point we'd normally receive our challenge but spitefully the production team said we had to drive forty miles to go and get it forty miles no problem at all come on yeah oh god
erm
the key won't turn in my ignition
mine doesn't start at all
hang on james which slovenly midlander built this the steering lock's gone on god i like it here
hammond's in trouble already
i got one hundred yards and it's broken i can't make the the throttle doesn't work in the lop sided princess james was unaware of my demise
i think british cars of the nineteen seventies were good we had this we had jeremy's rover great car the dolomite sprint that hammond's got great car
they've given us these little cameras to film our various calamities and we were expecting car problems and we've already got them there's another one jeremy's finger
i was just seeing what was in here has anyone got any butter
with some double a. wire and some double a. lurpak jeremy and i were soon on our way yeah and quickly we caught up with james so we could reflect on the brilliance of our cars'
there's some great details on this thing like the seatbelt warning light which flashes if you sit in the seat and don't put the seatbelt on perfectly everyday now but back then that was radical and annoying because seatbelts weren't compulsory
yeah
the noise he's making is biblical
i shall now engage my fully functioning overdrive by pressing this button nothing's happened
to get our first challenge we've been told to go to the old morris factory in oxford who told us to go away so we were sent instead to the old triumph factory in canley but when we got there we discovered it had been turned into a hotel the only evidence of its existence was a few forlorn road names so we were told to go to the old austin factory in longbridge sadly though it had gone
there's nothing there's nothing left
i'd heard the chinese had bought longbridge i didn't know they'd bought of it everything how's your car holding up i've got some odd squeaks and rattles i could actually make a fairly good drum solo out of various bits of trim in my car we decided to compare noises' and before you knew it
money by pink floyd
requiem to longbridge from the top gear british leyland trio
money
it's got something
get away
it was time to move on
you open the door the door's still there
we did eventually get our cars started and we made our way to where they set us some challenges more of that later on
wow can't wait for that
then of course we've got the battle between the subaru impreza the new one and the mitsubishi evo ten so much good stuff hammond what have you got
news from korea the kia picanto it's got a new front bumper look at that
wow is that it
yeah just the bumper anything else well more news from korea actually you know the hyundai coupe yes well there's a new one coming that looks brilliant the trouble with the hyundai coupe is that it always looks good
but its front wheel drive is a bit half arsed i always think
so what news have you got james this week
actually i've got some news from korea
you can't tell can you that top gear's just been sold in korea i don't think there's any evidence we're smoothing this one out
it's not showing hello you industrious little fellows that's got 'em onside well done
well from korea you know the kia cee ee'd the cee'd yes what about it it's the fourth best car of the year the fourth best it's the fourth best car of the year that's not even a podium finish
what beat it
the fiat five hundred was the winner third place was the ford mondeo in fourth place the cee'd and then in fifth place was the nissan kush kosh
squish squosh
it's not here
it's a survey
that's zero per cent of british people would do that what idiots have come up with that
you see it's the car of the year jury senior people from twenty two countries and they have a sort of pathological hatred of any car that's expensive they're just communists they are the interesting thing is a couple of weeks ago you remember i drove that rolls royce phantom drophead i dunno but i thought that was better than the fiat
i think it could be yeah
more news you know the hyundai sonata
oh hyundai korean car
new front bumper new headlamps new dashboard new radiator grille and i wouldn't have one me neither honestly things i'd rather do than drive one of those include presenting next week's show while gently cupping james's scrotum
and we're off the air in korea
bye industrious little fellows
give me a minute i'm gonna have troubling shifting that vision
you're gonna have trouble shifting it
you'll like this we've been sold in australia
we should probably talk about australian cars
is there an australian here yeah yeah
we're now yours yeah you've bought us
so we must talk about an australian car er yeah
it's got an american engine and it was engineered by a scotch
you're right so what else is there um there's
um
wasn't no
what australian cars are there
a that's a ford you blithering idiot it's american
what did you say you're no good at rugby and we've beaten you twice in the world cup that's what i heard yeah i think i will move on now have you ever wanted to buy a sports car that's got a diesel engine a top speed of one hundred fifty miles an hour that's a high riding four by four off road car and is also a four seater convertible
no
him yes i have
thanks for that you've ordered one of those yes
why because it's brilliant it's like saying you know i've had proposals this week from keira knightley and natalie portman but i've decided i'm gonna marry john mccririck
very funny and everything but you're wrong that's the last of the proper british sports car
it's got a german engine but the rest of it and it looks like an insect you drive a spider
you've got a panda you know nothing can i say something here
i'm with hammond you like that i think it's terrific when you said i'm with hammond i thought you meant we were going out
but it's no good then
oh no this is the best car i've driven all year and by a huge margin
really yeah
it's close to the ferrari five hundred ninety nine but honestly you cannot buy a d. b. nine any more you just can't because one day you'll be sitting at a set of lights someone will pull up alongside in one of these and you will feel hopeless inadequate and you will have to kill yourself anyway it is time to see how fast this goes round our track and that means handing it over to our tame racing driver some say that he knows two facts about ducks and both of them are wrong and that sixty one years ago he accidentally introduced her majesty the queen to a greek racialist all we know is i'm going to the tower now to have my head cut off and he is called the stig and he's off with a wheel spin and a v. twelve bellow thundering to the first corner it's wet out there let's see how that affects things a steady path through there no problems so far brilliant
what is my purpose what would i want to accomplish what values do i want to live by
what wall do i want to put my ladder of life against
it's a pleasure it's particularly heartfelt because you're not here to plug a book i'm not you don't really do interviews very often no
we never hear from you or see you in heat
don't you
ziggy and chanelle are there whoever the ziggy and chanelle are they're there i'm trying to fathom out since you don't have a book to plug what on earth possessed you to come to this cold and bleak place with these people when you could be at home doing something else
i'm a very competitive person mm and i've always thought i'm probably better off just thinking i could do it better from home than going there and proving that i can't do it better
a bit like going on millionaire both my kids just love the show
i finally gave in
are you a car fan yeah love them we have a test of that to find out do you yes we do have you at any point owned an alfa romeo
three
that's passing the test with flying colours the first car i bought was an alfa spider ooh the old one nineteen seventy eight that's the prettiest one of the lot very pretty
it's a proper no power steering little controls that you could do with your fingernails almost and i just drove it till you could see through the floor
forty yards in other words yes the last i heard you had a jag
so jags are quite popular i love jags until recently i don't like the new jag
it's got fat it used to have that lovely line and i thought that was the coolest car
the problem is that they have these focus groups where people like him hello they get somebody like him to go do you want a bigger boot yeah and they put a bigger boot on it would you like a bigger space in the back it's weird they don't actually listen to people like us who say make it pretty make it lovely let people enjoy it you've got a daimler sovereign we did have yeah not any more no
two wheel or four wheel drive two wheel you really do know what you're talking about richard hammond is going to leap onto the stage soon and start snogging you he's got one of those don't tell me you've got a land rover yes hammond which one little or big one little one i've got a little one why do you want a land rover
because we have horse boxes and trailers to pull and stuff
you've got horses yes oh i know why do people who have horses go so slowly you were gonna say yes and move them about
because you spend so much money feeding them getting them ready paying the vet's bills that the only pleasure is riding them and you don't wanna ruin it by them going lame in the horse box
doesn't matter you just sell them and make glue did somebody say that you were interested in a bristol
i love bristols why because it's quite a good joke and they just look so cool maybe they look cool with young people in them and just look like old people's cars with old people in them i don't know the trouble with bristols is they were designed in one thousand eight hundred forty three
and they're exactly the same they're like the forth road bridge but with cross plied tyres on them it's incredibly the guy that runs it has to like you before he'll sell you the car he does which is why he wouldn't sell me one he has banned james may from the showroom because he knows me
fantastic obviously cos i've been sitting here now i'll never be able to have a bristol
my dad was a great driver and loved driving and he was a pilot so he liked going fast
he did to impress my mother once fly upside down under telegraph wires
bad tempered if i lose bad tempered you're not one of those people that knocks the monopoly board over no but i'll negotiate winning before i begin to play i have to be lent money if i go bankrupt at a pre determined interest rate i would have to be lent money so i could continue with the game and eventually win
how often does you family play monopoly with you
never i'm not allowed to play games
i'm frightened now in case you haven't gone as fast as you were hoping you're frightened will you lose your temper the competitiveness did show through with one of the practices for the lap who'd like to see that
yes let's have a look
this is the first corner and still going no i'm gonna make it i was very cross i did that did you listen to the stig he was brilliant he was very good and very patient well let's find out if it washed let's see the lap first corner done much more neatly there
i've got to get one of these at home a track not the car
and still talking to the camera let's have a look through here that's a tidy you feel like you're going so fast the slower it looks the faster you're going all girls drive like that do they ellen macarthur was the quickest ever
can't let the girls down
there you are you can't let the girls down
fourth
flat out through there it's quite exciting that bit
really exciting
and exciting through there this is the hardest corner i did that wrong that's bang on that couldn't have been more perfect across the line now there they are the one who have been out in that car where do you think that you've come
i hope i have just come a bit faster than helen mirren
she's i really want to go a lot faster than kristin scott thomas
but i hope i can compete with helen mirren you beat kristin don't worry this is the girl zone
i could i could go faster than cowell stop me stop me cos i will die
gordon ramsay has now just committed suicide watching this
i beat the ramsay simon cowell is crapping himself now
i bet simon cowell is wetting his hitching up his trousers as we speak it's been an absolute pleasure having you here jennifer saunders that's just amazing
meanwhile earlier on the three of us each spent one thousand two hundred of our own money on three b. l. cars in a bid to show that the old british warhorse did occasionally get something right
yes and the producers of the show were keen to demonstrate that they never got anything right at all so they came up with a series of challenges
and for every one we passed we'd win money back towards the cost of the car
so full of enthusiasm we were sent to the mira test track top secret place where the motor industry tests all its secret new models it's just outside nuneaton on the a five between hinckley and atherstone just before the a four forty four if you get to fenny drayton you've got too far
how many bhps sixty nine
then along came that it showed the world cars could be reliable
but reliability is so tedious boring
here he comes now terrible brakes and across the line
one minute eleven
one minute eleven seconds
with nearly twice the horsepower of the datsun zero to sixty in eighty seven seconds and double wishbone suspension i will destroy the datsun's time go
my washing machine moves around the kitchen faster than that come on little fella richard it's for you it's for triumph it's for british leyland it's for britain
hairpin here we go this is where the sophisticated suspension will help him will not help him
struth
that's the slowest i've ever seen a car move
on the plus side the cornering did give my electrics a good shake every now and again the radio comes on that's my radio one minute eleven to beat yeah i think we did well
jesus yeah fifty eight seconds brilliant if you're watching this in japan there you go you're not so clever nice one well done
it felt good
let's see if we can give the datsun another thrashing with some rover v. eight muscle no need to worry about traction control it doesn't have it that was a wheel spin
that's not fast
that wasn't a sophisticated car despite looking modern
it's not a sophisticated man driving it yes
oh
what was that
he's off road a lot of grass
it does sound good no it sounds terrible
crossing the line unfortunately some oil had come out and was sort of on fire but no matter
your time yes my time
one minute eleven for that what one minute twelve
there it was it's not possible
even with ray charles at the wheel we could get this round faster well you didn't so now terrifyingly the pride of a nation rested with terry scott beautiful smooth six cylinder engine
it's just a rubbish sight
it's automatic as well the uneven suspension didn't help
bloody nora
but that wasn't the biggest problem
cock i've gone the wrong way what's he doing
you idiot you stupid long haired idiot
i don't think it'll have affected the time too badly
i've dropped it that's cos it was better are you gonna break it to him or shall i he must know he must feel it
he can't feel that went well so he feels it went well what i dropped the stopwatch yeah
so what was it really i don't know i dropped it but one hundred two
i think we all have to accept that after the power challenge where we should have done well we haven't no so how much money have we got back then
nothing none
so never mind we'll move on to the next challenge here it comes as you can see the stig's datsun is now parked on a one in three hill yes it is being held no problem at all by its handbrake you will now park your cars there put them in neutral apply the handbrake get out you get one hundred if it stays where it is
well it's a simple test yours is pointing in the right direction you go first it's steeper than you think very steep
it is a bit steeper than it looks i've stopped on the footbrake
ooh would you get out of that now no his foot's still on the brake
i'm not sure
what's he doing
that's the quickest i've ever seen him move
how's that you're there one hundred thank you
what a machine genuinely pleased about that
watch this i'm going to i was feeling confident about this test all i had to do was get to the stopping point it is steep
i've never seen that before
happily the wheel spin generated so much smoke the car was hidden from view i therefore claimed i'd done it and it was hammond's turn there he is parked that's not working for me at all
his foot's out his arm's out
having failed the handbrake test he's knocked down the sign warning him how steep the hill is
still every cloud and all that good test of how fast it goes backward with the handbrake on
so we'd tested the performance and the handbrakes so now it was time to look at ride comfort
this is the well known industry egg test who thinks of this stuff
there's no egg cap rating is there for new cars euro egg cap
we also learned that we'd lose money for any pieces of trim dislodged by the savage cobbles on the rough road
oh god it's rough
here he comes
argh got egg in my eye egg on the wheel
it's a warm day as well let's be honest
oh and the glove box has gone and the radio panel
look at that suspension work how's he looking eggy he looks like a spaniel that's crashed into the back of a hen
argh
what's happened to you i got covered in eggs where's your colander above my head where did you think it was it could have been worse not much how many were there there's five eggs there's a bit left in the bottom the only thing that worries me my eye is welded together with egg no that doesn't worry me at all no this is the most comfortable car here yes it is
that honestly isn't looking as bad as your car it is now
not enjoying it at all it's gone down my neck argh
something just came off it's the bumper it's not going well
argh sun visor's gone
i was working out the other day how many classics led zeppelin i mean classics like stairway oh dear
it wasn't even worth measuring the egg residue cos i'd lost so much money for bits falling off door mirror glove box lid oh and this funny thing
three four and this
and that five technically that six
i fired up the rover it does that
i've got more on the front why's that because mine was
i have to sit further forwards than you because i'm short that's it
ho ho
that looks pretty poor
coiled springs absorbing all the bumps nicely
a lot of weight on those springs
what you need to do is find the bit that's not been exposed
british racing green was an official colour no worries
except i desperately needed to wash my hair
oh get off jeremy that's disgusting
i've wiped my hair on a seat that's thirty years old and has had some midlander's bottom on it so i borrowed mira's wet weather skid pan now i'm drifting and washing my hair it's a world first
you're drifting i'm drifting off
we had tested speed hand brakes and ride comfort but there was one more thing i was told to weld my door back in place and report with the others to the top gear test track in drive suits' mine mine doesn't fit oh stop moaning it doesn't fit
ugh
we were given the challenge what your cars will now be filled to the brim with water and then you will drive round the track
that explains it but how will you breathe it doesn't say
it says when the water level drops below the bottom of the steering wheel you will stop the person who covers the greatest distance is the winner
yeah the water will come out of all the panels that don't fit properly so the quicker the water comes out the less well made it is
but the speed as well if you've got a really fast car you'll go miles
actually it's quite a thorough test because it tests performance and build quality
i just want to check it does say you go first
were you making it up yes
the cars would be filled by fire trucks and to make sure they didn't leak so badly they couldn't be brimmed with water the doors were sealed with gaffer tape you could have used warm water it's freezing there's thirty odd years' worth of fag ends and fluff coming up on top
look at it going up the window fantastic ha
oh i can hear him yeah go go go
the extra weight did blunt the dolly's performance
and he's leaving a big trail that's a big trail of water
the weight of the water is so immense that as you go round the corner it could slosh over to one side and roll over imagine filling the insurance form in on that well how did he drown this will take more than that little box
despite the dolly's leakiness i made it past hammerhead woo i'd better be honest that's just dipped below the steering wheel now
he's stopped he's stopped just below the follow through
more than half a lap more than half a lap think you can beat that let's see here we go
one of the issues with the austin princess we can determine now very badly fitted door handles it should have been called the austin colander even so it was filling quite well
this is a great sport
and i checked to make sure james's snorkel was working and go look at the speed james still has no idea how to drive round this track he never does car tests
argh
i'm going to pass hammond there it is yes
in fact the princess could hold its drink so well he did a full lap
he's not cheating i can't believe it
and then he passed hammond again
yes yes and i've just lost it
you've been lapped that doesn't happen every day lapped by captain slow in an austin princess full of water right bring on the rover yeah
the water thundered in
it is quite cold now
we're having to use two hoses because your rover leaks so badly rubbish
i was only bothered about my secret weapon yeah height adjustable
oh he's lowered it
two hoses still weren't enough we'll have to put a third hosepipe in to fill it
yes
yeah feel the power it's looking good oh no the damn door's come off
that's quite a big panel gap you've got there yeah
you lost that badly last place mate
in that test
that that wasn't even the door you welded back on was it no
i'll tell you exactly what happened this car this rover has been lightly restored by some previous owner who was probably an ape
yes my dad had three of those and none of the doors ever fell off
i didn't do that no i didn't do that i didn't do that
so that's no pounds to us for that the power test against the datsun
nothing no nothing
nought there coming back the handbrake test i didn't do that either no it was a sad moment that no pounds back for you
i did you did that's one hundred to you thank you
and i did it as well er
we never saw you do it but if you say you did it jeremy you did it
so that's one hundred back to me the egg test an important test
yeah now i had four grams of egg left but i lost two trim pieces so i'm twenty up
twenty up for james well done i had four grams left and i lost two trim pieces one of them was quite large i admit that's twenty up richard i had no egg left at all and six trim pieces fell off so
now the water test now this you got twenty p. for every yard you covered
you did one thousand five hundred yards yes so
that's um
it's three hundred you halfwit
it was right on the tip of my tongue three hundred for him yes three hundred back well done
i did i did four thousand five hundred yards which i think you'll find is nine hundred
well done nine hundred that's better than going on the weakest link
and you did ten yards jeremy that's two
yeah put it on every little helps
well done and james you are
thank you there was only one
just that they were rubbish
what letter from that andy we went to school with what phwoar andy
i'll phone andy get him round my house fork him in the eye no violence just tell him to back off leave janet alone

shall we have a go at making an elephant yes all right what i'm going to use is a piece of grey card for the ears
we'll do the ears first draw a couple of elephant ears on the card and another one on the other side and then we'll cut them out this is fiddly so you might need some help it's quite an awkward shape to cut out that's one i'll just cut that down there one elephant ear
it's tiny what shall we call our elephant um um ha ha shamba that's a good name isn't it tamba and shamba
right we've got our ears so we want some stickers now we'll peel off one of the stickers pop that on there and then you pop one ear on your finger like that then take another sticker you can use any colour you like i'm using blue for shamba then pop that on like that ah i see and to finish your elephant off take a pen with washable ink you can wash your hands afterwards i'm using this finger for my trunk so a couple of lines there two little circles for the end of the trunk
what about eyes oh we need eyes
a couple of eyes there and there and what about our feet we can do some little toes like that wow here comes shamba hello tamba

and there's another one
and there's one more three little frogs can we make some why not let's make a couple of froggies shall we
we'll take the ears off shamba for a second for the frogs shall we use some green stickers we'll use the big ones for the head and the smaller ones can be eyes we'll pop a couple of eyes on each frog
it doesn't look like a frog yet not yet
they're more like ears but wait a second now get the black pen and draw in a couple of eyes and then to finish it a mouth
ah we need names for our froggies tamba what do you think um what about ribbit and tibbit

come on milo what are you waiting for get out of the way jake
oh that's all right milo
sorry bella i should've waited my turn it's dangerous to push in
it depends how you
place to play it depends how you approach
it it can be intimidating but the great thing is there is always an atmosphere at gloucester and they will be desperate to play well they are tremendous bunch of people
as this
because the winner of today's game get a home tie you will see in a bit there are inspiring places to play so both sides will be desperate to bring the whole game back to their home
that ball was kicked by barkley who is leaving at the end of the season how much is this a big moment for him to leave bath on
a high he will want to do
a high but also
want to show the people behind us how good he is going to be and become a favourite of theirs undoubtedly money talks and that what it is about he is going from one good club to another
who has crossed that divide is mike tindall who people touting as the next england captain
what is your view on that it it depends on what you take the view on the longevity of the captain do you want one to try and play for the next world cup or see through one or two is the latter mike tindall is a good candidate if it is the he is maybe too world
let's see what the fans here make of the possibility of tindall being next man at the helm of the england
side he is a good leader we can watch him on the pitch he is always sparing the boys on
and it would be great he
boys on and it would be great he is mature respected and i think
the team i i think the whole squad needs evolve out of where it is at the moment to a younger side altogether i think he would do a
good job actually despite moving away from bath
i don't know i
given fact you are guaranteed a place in the semi finals already does that take any edge of today's game
i don't think so you just have to look around the place that is the local derby and the stakes are high people want to be at the top of the league at the end of nine months on both sides are trying hard
how much is today about winning all winning with style that you have played with in the last few weeks
i suppose if we won three zero and it was a doubt match i wouldn't complaining but i want to see players continue to play we are at our best when we are positive and this been such a shift and why we are where we are on the table
here we
where we are on the table here we are in
our seat amongst the great press what will their reports be saying hopefully that
it was
iain balshaw though it was a fantastic
then delayed the past and that meant that all the time he was
just the word i was going to use everyone is rooted the one try was well worked but you had brilliant defensive efforts to keep the other teams out
still going for gloucester yes it is an awkward bounce and iain balshaw gets the ball and matt banahan at the same time iain balshaw has dealt well with all the conundrums that hasn't always been the case in the number fifteen sharp particularly in the white one this time he did very well a bouncing ball and oncoming giant and he dealt with both of them very well butch james needed to be aware of the danger but now in open play the whistle goes vainikolo will be called back he has not heard the whistle it is all in vain poor old narraway and the shed but the whistle went very early on in that moved and it is all in vain do he is not entirely happy it seems was that the knock on the whistle went very quickly matt banahan under a lot of pressure from being bolshaw lost the ball is there to be one last great moment for bath iain balshaw gloucester are beginning to hang on to their top spot and they had conceded penalty the ball was held in the tackle by higgins the door was opening and then kick slammed in their face
they have lost their directors from the first part to the second half
among his way to celebrate
it was great it was never about individuals today was a real team performance a gutsy performance like all season we are not going to get ahead of ourselves it is a great win but we need to be ready for the play offs
we told probably about this game being a try test we told that had to shut them down and we did a tremendous job
credit to them people have written them off and they are in the play offs so there has to be somebody of that ilk sale sharks leicester but all we could control was playing at home and we are playing with confidence
how disappointing it is it not to have got home draw
it is disappointing but we have won at every other ground in the premiership before so we will do our best again we have made it hard for ourselves and give ourselves a mountain to climb but what do you do give yourself the evening to sulk and then get over it because sport you get another crack in a few days
for the game in the second half at least they were asked to do relatively little because bath were clueless they had no momentum and
this week and there is attention on the england any players today that you thought like ryan lamb maybe
there were four or five ambulances in front of us the ambulance crews said they have to stay with me until they can book me in and it was just over two hours by the time i got booked in
be breaking a few rules in the process but we don't think that's a pig deal in the general scheme of road safety clearly we shouldn't be condoning illegal behaviour but in boris's case he's cycling to work wearing his suit and we think
get punished for it
he should not break the laws
perhaps now he's got the authority he should make the roads safer for cyclists so he doesn't have to
today his people told us if he did go through a red light it was a mistake and he'll be more careful in the future children at schools in south london are to be shown a film by a former prisoner on the dangers of drugs the film made by a part time teachers features some of his pupils and shows in graphic detail

yes they were surprised to see her we had a chance to go out last night in a club or two so we had fun last night and we talked about the doing it today and she was like whatever of course
other great artists on your new album it's no exception but then when it comes to promoting the record and performing live they've got their own schedules it's good when that can happen
it's very good man it's the best she wanted to be a part of this and it made me happy she wanted to be a part sometimes you ask artists and they're like well you know i've got to rush off with me and her we've been so close for so long that it's beautiful
it felt voyeuristic watching you guys on the stage
we hadn't seen each other in a long time being out there remember how to do this
come closer kelly but in terms of this type of event a festival where there's so many different types of music involved is it something quite new for you to take part in in terms of that being that diverse tiff things
we're grateful
each time they reinvent themselves ever so much but done in an appropriate way
yes and not often you see someone play the recorder
he certainly wasn't play he it was probably judging by the beard
there's various techniques l. don't know if we'll get gallows he does the lean back mic technique with the short lead
mark is more of swing ball type where he tries to catch it at the end and type there was a couple of dangerous moments where i thought he was going to take holy out and thankfully he didn't we can go across to earlier on and check out the pigeon detectives
don't make me go don't make me go cos i'm not here to reflect you i wish your friends would leave me alone and i could never connect to the people i don't know from back home this is an emergency this is an emergency this is an emergency this is an emergency please don't do it lets not do this now something's happening can't we stay somehow cos i'm not here to reflect you i wish your friends would leave me alone and i could never connect to the people i don't know from back home this is an emergency this is an emergency this is an emergency this is an emergency cos i'm not here to reflect you i wish your friends would leave me alone the people i don't know from back home this is an emergency this is an emergency this is an emergency this is an emergency this is an emergency this is an emergency this is an emergency this is an emergency one hundred per cent absolutely rocket of course that's pigeon detectives simply called emergency

nice man oh it came down did it good there's a strange smell of burning fat
yeah i know
could ever meet just a fine young who were the winners and losers
teenage boy in london have described his death as an unprovoked attack on a decent young man tonight jimmy mizen's family and friends friends held prayers jimmy mizen was a gentle giant with a big heart and an infectious smile an altar boy who had just turned sixteen the day before he died in his brother's hours he had been challenged to fight which he characteristically turned down
jimmy was the sweetest boy you could ever meet just a fine young man happy all the time whistled as he walked down the road
family and friends held a vigil near the spot where he died embraced by their community
i feel for the parents of this boy l. can't get them out of my mind because what's happened to jimmy is the worst thing possible but we have such wonderful memories they haven't got memories for their son all they can think about is the evil they have done my prayers are with the family
it's always been a concern of mine the way i teach my children my sons to be street cred etc etc hold your head up l. thought no there is a decent way of living and that is what we have taught i feel that's come home to
very very pleased the euphoria in there was absolutely fantastic
brilliant so good it's amazing
we will drink ourselves stupid
joy too for fulham's fans who saw their side bate portsmouth and survive the drop it is reading who are relegated despite winning today as did alex mcleish's birmingham who will join them in the championship next season
the fans were singing sack the board l. don't blame the board i think the players aren't good enough
we have gone out with a bang who cares it is a game
something horrible's happened here
agh you all right
my producer teresa saves me from getting lost in translation
karin was saying that in the white nights you can talk to friends all night because from midnight till eight in the morning all telephone calls are free
is that true yes so you talk on the phone all through the white nights yes with friends i wanted to explore the changes since the collapse of communism we've walked in here and i say can we talk and the train's conveniently waiting for us to talk it's a very slow train this train isn't it but you would not have said oh yes i'll talk to you twenty twenty five years ago would you
at that time we would've been followed or asked what we're doing because if you were talking to foreigners or anything like that you would have been the subject of some kind of investigation or something so we would have been scared to do that
do you feel that life is better today than before her answer yes of course we are much freer
before everything was laid out in advance you know from cradle to grave every step of the way you knew what you would do or what would happen to you you didn't have any sort of leeway at all
yes you you you you on course
we're now on a steady course captain she's all yours this is karelia a land of myths and mysteries of rivers and forests an explorer's dream we made our landfall on a rocky headland which is thought to contain the oldest evidence of russia's almost unknown pre history this is demon's nose and these are said to be between three and five thousand years old you can see this shape of an animal here and there's a fish i think on speared in some way and then you it's quite difficult to see but if you move around here from here there's this figure of a giant man and this is the demon he's got an arm a hand and he's got a fish in one hand and as we're right by the sea that's obvious and it's said that they used to have sacrifices here that the gap in this rock was here before these were actually made they were blood sacrifices and the blood used to run down here and out into the sea and they say that this is the depiction of good and evil good where i started evil to here but whatever the case for me there's something i've just seen over here which is absolutely wonderful they're swans they're so elegant you can trace the neck and the body and there are one two that's been slightly broken away through there and some young ones cygnet little cygnets here i suppose they are absolutely i'm not usually turned on i have to say by cave paintings wall paintings but it is wonderful to see these here just to come here and walk through them this is quite another russia from any that i'd ever imagined not hard to be entranced and yes ensnared by the magic of this place karelia is laced by a network of rivers that wind deeper and deeper into the forest still quiet and remote out of time and out of place it seems not at all odd to be on a pilgrimage to meet a white witch is this an island where we're coming now
yeah this this is an island and this bridge is the only way to this settlement
i'm a sceptic i don't believe in witchcraft at least that's what i tell myself but here i'm not so sure with a helpful guide called andrei we are following in the footsteps of many other pilgrims who believe absolutely in the power of magic a budgerigar takes a fancy to me while we wait for the white witch she is called baba valya come
kak dzhon
jonathan
jonathan
in fact it was quite painless and her whispered incantations filled me with an unexpected sense of peace it's remarkable that in russia of all countries a belief in magic should have survived the last century and be flourishing in this but when she later instructed me to have a bath in salt water and then drink from it i have to say my scepticism about magic returned with a vengeance but her sincerity was palpable i wanted to know more andrei is an anthropologist who has made a study of magic in karelia and has won baba valya's trust baba valya explained that the forest contains both sprites and demons but when through andrei i asked how she makes contact with them she was clearly put out i'd upset her by implying she made contact with demons a force for evil when she only ever communicates with sprites a force for good in theory witchcraft was abolished under communism in reality no commissar could stop it and baba valya says that even the boss of a nearby collective farm used to ask her to cast spells to protect his communist cattle from marauding bears' thank you very much i began to see why she had a real following i'm very grateful for you saying i'm also grateful for your friend how lovely though she hadn't quite made a convert of me however a reminder of the very non magical world beyond was timely in this tranquil region it's only too easy to slip into self indulgent folksiness that's both unreal and patronising not least because life in post soviet karelia is hard at least communism offered security now there's none the jobs have gone the young have fled to the cities and the old die before their time so it was all the more poignant to find a troop of babushki grandmothers singing about love they had heard we were in the district and put on national costume to welcome us this song is of a young girl who doesn't want to marry the man chosen for her by the village matchmaker he chases other women and he drinks too much in the end the young couple live happily ever after though the divorce statistics in russia suggest a somewhat different ending
ti ochen molodets krasivy paren
you're a handsome man
ah
she says nobody's hugged me like that for thirty years
it was a great delight for me
she says i am going to remember all my life that such a handsome man clasped himself to my breast if i die it's o. k. now
what is life today like in this village
she says we've got everything except love we need love so much
so where were the men i asked she pointed to the cemetery
they all died yeah she buried two
behind the smiles and the laughter and the singing is a painful truth that russian men smoke and drink themselves to an early grave and that their life expectancy is just fifty eight years like ulysses from the sirens i had to tear myself from karelia heading west to a very different destination i love this sound just the sea creak of the sail knowing you're not using any fuel and it doesn't take a great deal of imagination to think what it must have been like three hundred or more years ago coming across these seas like this trading my journey had taken us south from the arctic circle through what was for me an unknown russia but i was now on my way towards a great international city built deliberately as a showpiece to the world this was my first visit to saint petersburg i knew venice and amsterdam but this was quite different and it's disconcerting yes it's an astonishing achievement impressive even overwhelming but it's a confection an artifice we were still so far to the north that while i was there the sun seemed reluctant to set and the parties never stopped this is saint petersburg chic very twenty first century urbane charming and to a man and woman only too happy to speak english
when i was in a different place the people asked where are you from from moscow no i'm from leningrad they'd say oh you are from leningrad the russian people like this city
it could easily be mistaken for london or paris but that's on the surface
unfortunately big country little people like well this is big country
yeah a lot of people this is big country less people you know so
perhaps that distance helps explain attitudes which are very very different where does democracy much vaunted democracy fit into all this
it's not that the glitterati don't go to the west they do but they see it from a very different very russian perspective
if you compare germany and russia we have much more freedom here in comparison to germany because they are so strict with laws they invent the laws to help people to feel they're themselves comfortable and in the end everyone is just following laws and it brings you to so many complicated situations and here
nobody care about laws that's a kind of danger
it's also part of life and part of freedom
so how does the word democracy fit into that then
i don't like it myself i don't like this kind of democracy and democracy for russia it can could be death really because people don't like democracy at all
you can go to the state organisations and work for bureaucratic system and be part of all this vertical of power which our president is building at the moment if you want this way you can go this way but if you don't want it you just do your life
you live outside you live outside or you live your own life very good such disdain for democracy has its roots in russia's past both distant and recent but for me it was still shocking to discover that these sophisticates should feel like that the man who founded this city was a visionary and an autocrat whose memory is still revered today peter the great looks across the river neva towards the spot where the story of saint petersburg began a little over three hundred years ago a modest beach a little summer playground which was then no more than a marsh the story has it that one spring day in one thousand seven hundred three tsar peter came through this pestilential swamp as it then was with his noblemen they were looking for a place to build a fort to avoid invasion from the north he surprised them suddenly by leaping off his horse seizing one of their swords and cutting a swath of turf in the soil and what is now actually imported sand for the bathing beach he could hardly have chosen a worse place for a fort let alone for what he soon said was going to be the most magnificent city in europe grandeur on this scale took more than one tsar to create and more than one century to complete but peter's was the blueprint and peter's the obsession but to realise this vision scores of thousands of labourers perished from hunger and disease sacrificed on the alter of his ruthless urge to transform russia into a truly european nation almost overnight everyone but everyone including the nobility were literally slaves to peter's dream three centuries on as a very conventional wedding party gathers beneath his statue it's ironic that despite peter's intent russia has not so much failed as declined to turn itself into yet another great european nation whatever it may look like on the surface it is an absolutely glorious city but i still don't know what i really feel about it in fact that's so far the same of russia as well it's complicated it's dense it's both in your face and elusive i read i listen i try to learn and i've still got very few answers i've seen quite a few of the palaces now the fantastic confection the facade but there is as i now very well know not least from this wonderful writer dostoevsky that there is another saint petersburg as well the real saint petersburg behind that glittering surface writing more than a century and a half ago dostoevsky described those corners of the city where as he put it another sun shines where all is gloomy and dingy where the floors and walls are discoloured and the cobwebs thicker than ever so this was your home for quite a long time
it used to be for quite a long time oh for more than thirty years
ilya utekhin is a social scientist who grew up in this building in the soviet era he lived at the top of this once grand staircase it's pretty depressing that it's like this isn't it
but my grandmother told me there were carpets here on the stairs
there were carpets down here yes
in her childhood well it was right after the revolution
the bolsheviks forced the rich to surrender their grand dwellings to the proletariat what had once been home to a few wealthy households became communal apartments crammed with more than one hundred people to every floor
how many families living in this block altogether would you guess
thank you
inside the apartment we found ourselves in dostoevsky's world but in the twenty first century it smelt of boiled cabbage and old sweat it's hard to believe that three quarters of a million people in saint petersburg still live in communal apartments
you lived this was your family kitchen shared kitchen for what thirty years
oh yes that's true and this was my table it is not mine now and here was my cooker
you pointed at just those two you had half a cooker
initially it was half a cooker then it became whole cooker when the density of the population fell
what was it like oh it was quite natural
if you are not accustomed to anything different it's not strange to you it's quite poss ible you see more than half of human kind are living in conditions even worse than this
if i'm standing over here and i like singing when i'm cooking and someone's cooking there and actually hates me singing those things create great social communal tensions don't they
yes really and this place communal kitchen is the place of communal scandals when people are shouting at the same time it's like italian opera
what impact did it have on people to live like this for a long long time
it led to some special features of character this lack of privacy this sort of being on stage and at the same time the idea of sharing the social justice in this small community is very heavily loaded with envy
could you imagine ever wanting to live back in this kind of place
oh yes i think so it's not
like this it would not be
well you know you'd want to soviet people are accustomed to all things do you know why because they separate their life and their everyday life their life is something special is self realisation is spiritual life is achieving something in your work writing books i don't know having good relationships to people and the everyday life this sleeping eating washing dishes things like that they are not important for your life this is everyday life and you can just
it's the material conditions doesn't matter i have to say i'm jolly glad i don't have to make the choice
yes me too you know
where from are you
from england ah i see from england so directly yes
you're learning i mean you're learning
within moments he was talking about the siege
you see it was terrible hunger terrible one hundred twenty five grams bread that's one small piece per day and so people was trying to do something the golden watch of my grandfather was changed for food for horses
you ate you ate the food for horses
yes and it was possible to eat it but you understand the weight of this watch was twelve grams gold
a gold watch traded for animal fodder simply to stay alive
plenty of people who perished for nothing really lost their the all the property men can have their souls
when the siege began dmitri shostakovich leningrad's most eminent citizen was still in his apartment here he was at work on a piece of music that would become famous throughout the world symphony number seven the leningrad to find out more about the impact of that music i went to see saint petersburg's distinguished conductor valery gergiev who had just finished rehearsals
yes we're totally totally wet
well you were working flat out of course
the leningrad symphony was performed here in the philharmonic hall in august nineteen forty two although the musicians were so weak they could hardly hold their instruments the music was broadcast throughout the city it was an inspirational moment
clearly it was a voice of nation and clearly it was a voice of the city a h. e. ro city a hero not only city didn't surrender city never lost hope leningrad by dmitri shostakovich shostakovich wanted still to embrace emotion and even the suffering on the people you maybe need this one hour or seventy minutes and put everything you think about people dying on the streets who've been frozen to death and of course people dying of hunger the performance of the seventh symphony demonstrated to the world that there is no force no power which can overcome this voice shut it the voice was heard all over the world it was one of the most sonorous performances of all times
leningrad survived because of this lake lake ladoga an expanse of water so massive that the germans were unable to encircle the entire city in the bitter months of winter the russians built a road across its frozen waters which brought some relief at least to the starving city it was this fact that made me realise that for all its oil and gas russia is really defined by its waterways the seas lakes and rivers which form the arteries of the nation now heading away from saint petersburg i've hitched a ride on a fishing boat good fishing today valentin it's good for the fishing
ha ha ha ha ha ha
in the summer valentin takes his boat out twice a week if he's in luck he catches just enough to break even is it possible to make a good living from the fishing here
no
niet
no niet niet
fishing he explained so vividly that i hardly need a translator is a lottery
casino
ah
mutters to himself
it's a casino i get the message it's a gamble sometimes yes sometimes no valentin has a wonderful zest for life which is not impaired one bit by the loss of his arm in a sailing accident some thirty years ago
my hand one hundred ten
it's the complete unexpectedness of it because we don't know what the earth might hold and then suddenly you see these things and it's just such a thrill it's like a card game a gambling game for very high stakes that you just sort of are completely riveted by it i don't need to tell you that when you're gambling for high stakes you can forget about everything around you and then you kind of hit the jackpot and you find these things
you need it not to hot your brains
so my brain doesn't get hot my brain's always overheated
and it it is used for your hair also
this programme contains strong language
yes
it's all the extra weight i weighed my boobs did you you can weigh them on a food scale not in the grocer's shop why is this not on the show that sounds amazing
which one is the biggest this one by how much by what margin
by half a pound that one's my favourite
have you ever weighed them before
no never are they that much bigger yes they're enormous get 'em out
don't be shy
it is very warm minnie
it is the most incredible by product of being pregnant is getting just a rack and a half never really having had big boobs before
i'm trying so hard to maintain eye contact almost impossible go ahead you can look right finished now don't ask me to get up for a few minutes graham will be fine
it's like being on the bus oh i can't get up now vibrations
that is my favourite thing with pregnant ladies on the bus i would always rather see a pregnant woman standing than a fat girl sitting down crying it's just we've all done it it's just the worst feeling of thinking i wish the earth would open up and swallow her it would be a fucking massive hole obviously
now have you guys met before he's so mean
no
yeah just out there it was amazing i'm so masculine that happened
but you're a fan of minnie's you've seen her films i have
cos you were looking at another sad fat girl which i was in that film you were yeah didn't you put on two you have a thing about them i do
they make a good breakfast obviously they won't share it with you
did you say sad fat girl hardly sad fat girl that was a nice shot
brave yes exactly i don't think you would have
i love the way hollywood casts people in films and go she's the plain one really i would always but she was meant to be a bigger
i mean look saffron burrows who was like a proper model this was her first movie and she came straight off the catwalk to come and do this film and she was really good she's so hungry she's eating lipstick
that would be a good photo for photoshop wouldn't it yes it would it's ideal what
now we were talking about that thing of how celebrities who haven't met each other still feel like you can say hello
no that is creepy and weird if you do that it's so strange but yeah that exactly does exist but it's really weird
is it more l. a. than here no i'm sorry to say it's not at all
here people scrabble desperately to try and find a connection oh didn't you do an episode of casualty back in nineteen ninety five no there is that sort of in l. a. there is just the kind of hey how are you it's great to see you you're awesome i love you
speaking of meeting random people in the street i met someone in stoke on trent who wanted an autograph and a chat they said do you know graham norton i went yeah i know him a bit i've seen him around they went you know he's straight he's got a family and kids and i went i don't know if he has they went i'm pretty sure he has
i might have refused to sleep with somebody in stoke on trent once
i don't believe that for one moment graham

what's a funny joke what's a funny joke like a joke joke i know that's a horrible
what's a funny joke it's like someone's aunty what's a funny joke tell us a funny one though not those ones the funny ones
in fairness you have written a book about what is a funny joke
i think it depends if you laugh at it and think it's funny then it's funny if you don't then maybe not
with an audience you've got to get the majority thinking you're funny how do you ascertain what will do that
well they've come to see me
just because you're inherently funny and they're hoping you'll continue to be
they might have seen me somewhere before it's rolled on no one pitches up going this guy's got a fat face let's see
they say that about me all the time
do you have a favourite joke minnie
we're on television
a snail gets mugged by a couple of tortoises the police show up and they go all right what happened he goes i dunno it all happened so fast
adorable it is good
it's getting a round of applause
my favourite joke like proper pub jokes are like why do women watch porn to the end
why to see if they get married
that's very good that's a funny joke
i love that joke
tell you what else i like it's a classic joke format it's the irishman in a library irishman goes into a library and says fish and chips the librarian goes this is a library sorry fish and chips just such a perfect construct it's just a joy
we asked the audience for their favourite jokes on the way in they thought long and hard alistair cameron where is he actually now look at you there alistair you look so nice who are you here with
it's not just a funny joke but brilliant advice that's christmas sorted yeah love it
entertaining and oh have to meet i've gotta meet this woman where's connie bradley connie hi connie hi hi now i'm sensing connie has issues in her life she seems a little angry her joke is why can't a man ever please a woman because no man is a dick made of chocolate that ejaculates money
if they did they wouldn't fuck you with it
it would melt
yeah what are you thinking woman
that's a funny joke and it tells us everything we need to know about guy hello guy
yes it's his way of telling people something about himself
the two guys sitting on either side look a bit
that wasn't a dream now do you think humour travels across countries
yeah pretty much certainly anywhere english speaking they'll get the same jokes
we're going to do an experiment because we've got our own german comedy club backstage we can cut to that those people are german
what have they won i dunno must've won something
are they dating the cheeky girl they have similar drinks they're all back there the nice germans we're going to ask a translator here to go in and deliver the joke hello sir what's your name it's henry henry from germany from germany of course very good it's going well so far i think so he's gonna kill in there you're a funny guy henry funny guy now what joke i think the he could either tell skiing or he could tell the dildo that way if she doesn't like it she can go fuck herself which do you want him to tell slippers or skiing what do we think

they're making drinking ten pints in one glass
oh look at the acting there that was good he had a dream
the other one

he won't be able to come back in here god yeah
he's won over twenty people he's lost three hundred exactly
lovable bunch try the one about the rich man and poor man buying presents for their wives
i didn't get the fun side of that so
i just told it

oh yeah go do it do it do it
no i can't i can't i can't yes you can
she sounds chinese if she doesn't like the ring
she can take it back in her b. m. w. and still be happy the poor man replies i got my wife a pair of slippers and a dildo that way if she doesn't like the slippers she can go fuck herself
oh my god let me help you up oh my god no they loved you they wanted to laugh more than they did
no they were raising their steins in the air now i'll let you sit down cos obviously how far along are you in the great scheme of pregnancy
i'm six months six months yeah
and has it all gone well
it has i was dreadfully sick to begin with it was miserable
have you had the cravings
no just revulsions just complete aversion to things all right don't look at me
just revulsions what what all right jesus calm down
what don't you like that you did like raisins and eggs
ouah oh raisin omelettes off the menu yeah i really could never eat that i don't know why i was really weird they properly revolt me so you didn't have craving for olives i did and i dreamt about olives large huge olives like stonehenge that i would eat
massive big olives one bigger than the other could weigh them on the kitchen scales bla bum
you don't want kids you've gone on record saying you don't want them
er no not i'm not anti kids i'm pro childlessness i think you've got the right idea i like the gay lifestyle no strings and not having to look after it's a big responsibility you like your life how it is you've thought about it
it's a bit late now love but you know yes i have thought about it and i completely i was like i was like you for thirty seven years were you could that be any more patronising probably not
that was good
i just don't i don't fancy it i mean we tried for a baby we got pretty close outside asda last saturday the security there are shit hot but keep trying yeah
i'd love that i'd love the idea of someone shouting i know how babies are made that's adorable
have you got names well you don't know what's in there yet
i'm gonna let it come out and i'll meet it first and see what it i don't know what i'm gonna call it it's a nightmare my name's really stupid driver's hard to put names with wait
it's hard cos you do want to make it funny
someone did my mate said i should call it duncan and then it could be dunc driver that's quite good isn't it that is good nice but that's the only one that i've really taken seriously
you can call a girl getaway surely it sounds dutch
getaway's a good name for a girl getaway getaway driver i like it
i like that a lot getaway driver it's good isn't it
my name's minnie this is my daughter getaway we're the drivers
i think a great middle name is danger danger yeah so she could go my middle name is danger that's my middle name if she becomes a spy she may not
i got a lot of books in about the subject now i have to say
just because you're gay you should know how this is done
well
come on books on babies where willy went well i've got a feeling there needs to be another version of that
yes yeah meanwhile
the sequel is called the clap clinic
it's for kids obviously and it's a bit scientificy there's willy was a sperm he's a little sperm and willy lived inside mr. brown just here you see
do you need to call him mr. brown there's confusion there before we start little visit to brown town that's a different thing entirely
he lives with two hundred million other sperm and they all lived in mr. brown at the same address presumably no one the bollock there they all are
did you knock through yeah
i made it open plan it's to die for
soon it'll be time for the great swimming race willy practises every day marvellous
do you think there's teenage mums watching this up north going that's how it happens
there's one prize a beautiful egg the egg was inside mrs. brown his wife or his mother i don't know oh that's good isn't it
oh god that's the swimming race oh right sorry there you go
then at the very end they have the baby
wait there's a sperm called butch oh that's the plot he's racing against butch
this isn't the first draft of the book the first draft finished with a facial
so you've got this whole book where willy went right they have a baby little girl they called her edna the last page but where had little willy gone who knows
that's very unsatisfactory
have you heard about these things for obviously men they don't get their but they're called empathy suits right empathy suits
for men to empathize with yeah this is an empathy suit
this is serious this is real i can't that is so heavy
let me see if it weighs as much as my boobs no
so what we thought we'd do is a bit of i'll unvelcro it is i'd give a man an opportunity to wear it now are there any men in the audience who've fathered many kids how many fathers are in the audience man how many have you had up there sir four four children right and is that the mother of them beside you yes all four of them yes does he sit still
ask him if he empathized with her
i think that may explain why he's got four kids yeah go on then why not
we're gonna try and get you pregnant
the twins or all of them
all of them if you can remember
dexter kenny reuben and fraser who's looking after them tonight the nan that was lucky
i knew i forgot something
i've read you're nervous because of the terrible pressure in hollywood these women pop out a baby and the next minute they're just looking incredibly svelt i'm not nervous i'm just i want to know
do they just get tummy tucks is that when people have a scheduled caesarean and then i think they get their tummies done at the same time i think it's weird that sort of five days later you're looking like a size eight again it's ridiculous
does it only happen with celebrities or to regular women too that you bounce back no it takes time
your body's got to get back i don't think it's going to happen i'm planning to have my baby in a tank of water actually
really
i really just want to i feel like we're naturally designed to have kids i'm not scared of pain oh stop it we are uniquely designed to bear children i'm not i said we
yes
talking of weight loss obesity in this country has me has it suddenly become a problem people talk about it there's a lot of examples there's greed there
domino's now make a double decker pizza someone must've asked for it someone must've said i'd like a pizza we get a lot of that what would you like as a topping another pizza that is
there are still greed oh yeah
the five fruit and veg a day there's people counting in jaffa cakes
i love that woman gillian mckeith
she's on a show called you are what you eat begging the question what did you eat the witch from rent a ghost she's like this she's like a lizard yeah she gets a middle aged woman who's let herself go a bit a bit plump she's not a danger to shipping she shows her a table of food and says this is what you eat in a week it's the same table kerry katona shows us in the iceland ads then the amazing bit the piece de resistance at the end she goes she's into this like it's the most natural thing in the world she's into this and then she's got the audacity the brass neck of her to go your poo's a bit smelly it's made of shit gillian i think i may have solved this riddle the reason it's a bit reeky is it just fell out of her arse you fucking maniac there seems to be a lot of that in california a lot of that i'll analyse your poo nonsense
i'm worried about you laughing it's absolute
no it's all right i'd only pee i wouldn't have the baby
does that happen where have you found
kegel exercises this was what i was going to tell you about yes
what's a kegel it's what you do
what girls do don't do that when you want to stop peeing it's what a girl does it's the action she takes to stop peeing they encourage you to do as many kegel exercises a day basically squeezing your noonie
when you say noonie
often the squeezing is how the conception happens as well
really
they're strange and wonderful creatures so it's pelvic floor exercises exactly i never knew there was a floor and i've had a look
but have you got it carpeted presumably baby now is taking up room that used to be things like bladder intestine lungs do you find yourself having to pee a lot more
all the time i'm ready to pee now i was rather hoping i could go back with the germans no stop it
it's all right i'm nearly finished fill your boots literally fill your boots love
