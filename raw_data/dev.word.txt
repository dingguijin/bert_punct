there is evidence that the economy is slowing house prices are falling and unemployment is starting to rise the monetary policy committee would be cutting interest rates sharply to head off the risk of a recession it can't do that when inflation is three per cent and rising it could be some months before we start to see interest rates fall sharply
see interest rates rise further but they are at a high level and so a lot of households will be disappointed that we are not going to see interest rates fall sharply in the near term
it is the sort of thing you get a roast turkey turkey under no it doesn't bear thinking about
coming up ah sheryl crow will be joining us to tell us about the inspiration for her latest album
she has had a tough time of it
technically what the employers are doing is not illegal we are saying just because it is not illegal doesn't mean you have to do it you need to be honest with your staff and customers a wage should be a wage and a tip should be a tip
i had never been in trouble before i am not brought up to be around crime i felt devastated the most thing i had on my mind was my mum she did not bring her children up to be like that l. was more disappointed in myself than anyone
some of the increases involve public order offences and violence it is often carried out by girls who are drunk this community police officer says there are other problems such as shoplifting
in the past we have not seen grows significantly involved in crime however recently we have stealing things like cosmetics and make up the onus is on the shops to stop that kind of thing going on it seems a terrible waste for young people to get a criminal record for stealing things like that
young people of either sex are more likely to be a victim of crime and to commit one from today the british crime survey will try to get accurate picture accurate picture a man has been charged with the murder of jimmy mizen jake fahri nineteen will appear in court in sutton today our correspondent joins us what more can you tell us
and ninety year old man from lea in south east london was arrested by detectives from scotland yard on tuesday in nineteen year old man just before midnight last night we had confirmation from scotland yard detectives that they had enough evidence to charge him with the murder of jimmy mizen
take a look at the scene behind me there is still a massive clean up operation what the majority of fans they were drinking chanting and singing after the screen broke shortly before kick off there was frustration and that will draw a minority of fans threw bottles at the screen and threw bottles at the police riot police were called there were skirmishes and classes for an hour or two after the match one russian fan was stabbed a mile or two away from here at the city of manchester station this city of manchester stadium
the sea and the atmosphere yesterday was very good what went wrong what at police saying
to get through
people are coming to work this morning taking photographs on their phone l. think people are pretty surprised
absolutely the people's liberation army co ordinating the rescue is one of the biggest in the world an increasingly well equipped army the chinese are authorities have just issued a public plea asking for a very basic rescue equipment they are looking for anything that can help them to get to these people ten million people from a population of around twenty million every second person in this part of sichuan has been affected that means they have lost their homes their crops of their loved ones
they will have been some foreigners caught up in this as well we at least we had that group of british tourists have been found what more can you tell us queue this area is very popular with tourists he is very picturesque
there is nature reserve and
giant panda breeding farm
a number of tourists were stranded at an nature reserve they were out of contact this morning we heard that thirty three tourists british people among them have been airlifted to chengdu the regional capital the foreign office is taking to see if the missing nineteen were among that group we will bring you an update as soon as we have confirmation
in nottingham we welcome the publication of the statistics it does reflect the not a game scenario but there is some caution with the figures youth crime in nottingham is decreasing girls are a small proportion of that
have you seen more goals committing crime over the past year
we have seen some increase more girls certainly around public disorder and common assault there are some changes interesting lee those going on to commit more crime as quickly as we might expect with boys or think the jury is out in terms of the exact reasons of why there are a number of reasons people put forward currently the government is looking into research l. think alcohol may have some contribution we also think that some of the sorts of crime girl on liquor all crime is something we may have seen in recent years goal on goal
it is worrying if people our thinking that goals are now committing violent attacks against each other and getting involved in a drunken behaviour the figures for boys have actually gone down
yesterday of his package of new laws the guardian has a look at cate blanchett arriving at a premiere of a film
we were saying the express has got a different lead today and it is talking about a bin tax ministers are pushing ahead with plans for pay as you throw bin taxes days after gordon brown says they were going to be axed five pilot schemes will be rolled out and it could slap up to one thousand a year year on every family that recycles enough jtsdsed ufrld the independent almost all parents worry about meningitis

it is vital that everybody feeds birds in their gardens and it is fantastic that so many enjoy doing t. bread done have have a lot of nutritional value
they might stuff themselves full of bread at the detriment of other things
these are fantastic alternatives mild grated cheese breakfast cereals porridge oats maybe things like leftover potatoes cooked pasta and rice we all have them for our tea and we have have bits left over afterwards
cake well
you peel it first you throw food into the garden the birds come down and you feel at one with nature and i suppose if you think you are giving them the right food as well that will feel better before you go you know the oats they were showing somebody says do they need to oak them beforehand can you ask jemma
with the oats do we need to soak them before
no you can throw them out in handfuls not too many just a little bit at a time
thank you very much i will tell you what the birds love
technically what the employers are doing is not illegal what we are saying is because it is not illegal done mean you have to do it you need to be honest with your staff and you need to be honest with your customers a wage should be wage and a tip should be tip
judge just how much the disappointment takes out of them we certainly hope that what is what that back with is what is that they four games left to remain two trophies we would hope they can overcome the disappointment of tonight and not let it affect them
very disappointed but the fans were fantastic even when we got beat they were still singing the fans that never got a ticket to will be disappointed as well they should enjoy themselves as well hopefully we can get the domestic treble
hull city will face bristol treble city in the coca cola chaabi tip play off final after beating watford four to one last night the score six to one on aggregate the hull fans were obviously delighted look at the scenes at the end of the match the final text there is at wembley a week on saturday is wet and windy in london today after two weeks of glorious sunshine it is because the first test between england and new zealand get on the way at lord's today in them with field the same team that won the series in new zealand back in march ryan sidebottom were the beer will lead the attack justine henin has done the world of tennis by announcing her immediate retirement she is only twenty five and has quit weeks before defending her belgian dash macro french open crown french open crown she pulled out of this week's italian open blaming fatigue
i took my decision and that was it i am like this when they decide
something i do it the right way
won the french open four times three times in a row l. do not have to live that moment again l. know how it was and there will have been lucky i know i have been lucky it was awesome to win at last year want to keep his fill in for ever
if we have flexible hours i will be able to go back to work as soon as possible maybe they can put my child into the day care
of nine to five are gone you need to be adaptable
if ahead and the children of my own i would like to work two or three days a week
i have no problem with that most people i know in a business profession actually prefer to pick up the slack for people with families because they respect that when they have families it is going to be doubt the same way
think drives me and a lot of my clients insane with anything that is mandatory un up with people demanding more than they're loud
it makes things very difficult
have got three people working for me to work different hours people speak to different people on different days the client wants to speak to the same person
we spoke to you in the past about employing mothers of child bearing age and mothers to have children you're not having any of it you
or might workers have children but they are not of child bearing age anymore you have got some of the another ward who has produced this report who has never run a business in her life e. mail there walji in the end while it may work for some people in my people we can get away with it that man said how can you expect all businesses to accommodate employees will demand it it is another employee vote poor
linda i guess you're going to disagree you do not have too much of a problem with flexible working in it takes really good planning openness and honesty in terms of what the employee is looking for and what the business can make work and agreeing mutually between us how to make that work successfully does your heart sink when one of your employees comes to you and asked to work fewer hours to work from home because you think it is a headache for you
know it does not make my heart sink i would much prefer that that somebody coming to me and telling me they cannot make this work and giving me the resignation l. get happy workers happy workers are more productive workers we do a much better job
i have just had one of my people go down from four days a week to two days week i knew and needed to keeper now i have that to find somebody for the other two days a week she came for four days a week now i have got a dented too it makes life very difficult i would love it if they all came in at nine a m. on monday morning and went home at five p. m. on a friday afternoon
i do not think that is realistic the next twenty years there will be a shrinking population of people working if we say there are barriers and allowing people to work flexibly and part time where we going to give workers keep were who really be held responsible for parenting skills
we are already being held responsible for parenting skills everybody works from home they will not have to walk can meet to work and therefore will save the environment what else will employers have to be responsible for q. i run design consultancy run a celebrity management consultancy i need to be there all the time i have had people applying for jobs to have said i would only want to midomicom or as an wednesday and for her at and thursday it is not conducive to a successful business
if somebody is working part time one day and they ring in the next day they are not there
that they all sown the same sound the same
not at all they are all doing a great job clients are not interested in that as long as they deliver what you asked them to deliver
you're fired
i was expecting more we are talking about wedding cakes this morning because one of apprentices didn't cut it when it came to the wedding trade we will meet the contender sir alan fired last night it didn't help when one said if you don't buy this cake today you're stupid
and the groom is stupid
sunshine today we are looking at
we have spent a lot of time talking about how b. t. charged while you have been in charge how would you sum up your six years
bropbd broadband is now all over if you look to the business it was not the global business today it is a really global business and if you are a shareholder you get two pen dividend six years ago this year you will get one hundred fifty eight so it is seven or eight times more
more money for shareholders
customers and that big move into broadband and that's probably the thing that you will be remembered for most
well i don't know what people will remember but i know that today if you look to broadband it is the way of life it is what people want it is what they experience new ways of communications new ways of doing business new ways of interacting with their family
every time you appear some viewers get in touch and say it is all very well ben saying these great things about broadband but b. t. drags its feet and is slow in making connections it is not happy about running the struck infra ture so other companies companies can offer the broadband service true or false
it is remarkable in business most business careers end in retirement or they end in failure because people are driven out because shareholders are fed up and want them to go you decided it is time for a change
i believe that leadership has a shelf lifetime you need to stay fresh and stay focused on improvements all over and if you had your run it is better to call it a day and say there is a new new guy coming it is a a great great team
any thing you regret
talking to many people too long
after one hundred thirty years of trading
darlington cattle market is under threat because it is too noisy all the cattle cattle mooing we sent danny savage to hear and see what the problem is well is it noisy
the rights to have an auction mart here was protected by an act of parliament what will it mean if the market does have to close down because it is too noisy
well we would have to look to go fifty or sixty miles further afield this is a leading fat stock in the north of england market and it would put a lot of extra costs on our business
around us at the moment we have vehicles coming in to drop off more cattle and there are just houses across the road sarah lives locally what's the
you have this from early in the morning yes this business will close down if the restriction come into place you have some sympathy
we have no problem with the business the trucks a used to be taken in at the back and that had little impact on the local community now
you have this all the time
all the time
technically what the the employers are doing is not illegal we are saying just because it is not illegal doesn't mean you have to do it you need to be honest with your staff and customers a wage should be wage and a tip should be a tip
some of the biggest increases in today's figures involved public order offences and violence often carried out by girls who were drunk and this community police officer in essex said there are other
young women l. don't think the amount of alcohol drunk today its far greater than it was perhaps fifteen to twenty years ago but we have to be careful with these statistics what they represent is not necessarily more crime although i think they probably do to a degree but more police activity to deal with that crime we saw that police officer in that report saying it seems such a shame that a young girl should get a criminal record for stealing something as simple as a bit of make up from a shop perhaps five years ago they wouldn't have done perhaps five years ago they would have just got a warning of some kind that didn't actually mean they had a criminal record that was recorded as part of the recorded crime statistics l. think that's particularly true in terms of the violence figures which are startling a fifteen per cent increase over three years but what we are seeing is the police who now have a target to get more offences to court actually saying right one girl has pulled the hair
one to four in terms of the amount of crime they are not in the same league you're talking about them becoming more like boys they've got a fair way to go because before they commit the same level of crime as boys l. think we should be positive about these figures today in one sense we're seeing a picture of stability here in terms of recorded offences by the police despite the fact that there they are being asked to bring more offences do justice a pretty stable picture and other evidence and it's hard to get a handle on this but one of the things the criminal office does is asked people on a regular basis about the crimes that they've committed over time you can ask people about the crimes they have committed and find out if it is going up or down that also shows the position of stability they have been some ghastly crimes involving young people which make the headlines and a regular basis but they are really quite a few overall the story is youth crime remaining pretty flat
a man has been charged with the murder of jimmy mizen that's the teenager who was stabbed to death at lee in south london the day after his sixteenth birthday let's get more details jake fahri will appear here at sutton magistrates' court this morning we have been told he will arrive here at in the next fifteen to twenty minutes detectives arrested him on tuesday afternoon he was held in custody for more than twenty four hours it was late last night just before midnight that detectives decided they had enough evidence to charge him with the murder of jimmy jimmy was attacked a day after his sixteenth birthday a popular fun loving schoolboy described by his parents as a gentle giant who had a bright future the teenager died on saturday when he went to the shops with his brother near their home in leigh to buy a lottery ticket at one thousand one hundred fifty he was attacked at the three cooks bakery answer but serious neck injuries paramedics did all they could to try to save him but he died at the scene family and friends have since visited the spot laying flowers and paying tribute his classmates have been leading their own messages of condolence on sunday many gathered to say prayers for jimmy at the church where he had been an altar boy a memorial service was also held at his school on monday it was meant to be his last day before going on to start an apprenticeship his parents and those close to him on trying to come to terms with losing in his father's words a dear dear sweet young man when jake fahri does the right here the defendant at the magistrates' court it's expected to be a pretty short hearing he will be asked in court to confirm his name his age and also his address then he will be asked whether he wants to enter a plea when that charges formally put to him and eighteen year old man has been charged with the murder of stephen bigley in london's oxford street anthony costa is accused of stabbing the twenty two year old outside a restaurant he will appear in court later today riot police have spent most of the night trying to restore calm to manchester city centre that's following trouble at the uefa cup final last night that trouble started when a big screen which was set up for the rangers fans who didn't have tickets broke just before kick off when the big screen broke the frustration was perhaps understandable but it soon boiled over among the minority who clashed with police ugly scenes on one of the big nights of european football there were injuries and arrests what police describe as a sickening act to a sporting ball
from what i saw and there are always two sides to every story but i saw my officers behaved well they responded with restraint and it was appropriate to the level of violence they have received l. have seen some quite disturbing footage tonight which we will be investigating at this stage i really do not believe there was any heavy handed policing
there were few reported incidence between rival supporters although one russian fan was stabbed near to the stadium he is not thought to have been stick seriously injured the amount of litter and broken glass mean that parts of the city centre are literally crunching underfoot the clean up operation has already been under way for a few hours but is going to take a long time yet let's talk to sir richard lease he is leader of manchester city council thank you for joining us horrible mess behind you that is the least of your problems isn't it bearing in mind what went on last night we're hearing it was all down to the big screen what went wrong
rubbish we can clean up we had at least one hundred thousand rangers supporters in the city last night it's unprecedented it's the biggest movement of people for an event of this or that ever taken place the vast majority of those were reasonably well behaved we had no problems whatsoever when the big screen went down we did have contingency plans we put another screen up some distance away the bust people to it and the vast majority of fans went about alternative screen a small number of fans didn't they stayed in the city centre started throwing bottles at the police that's when it all kicked off
do you think there was some problem perhaps in the planning manchester bid to have the game held their they invited the fans down more than one hundred thousand arrived wanting to see the game at somewhere was the city up to it in the end
saying they are disgusted with what happened to the sport with the small minority of fans can i ask about the mess it is something that can be cleared up but how long as it going to take before manchester gets back to normal
manchester is getting back to normal if you were to turn the camera round the other way you would see people going to work just as they would do every other day we can clear the rubbish up this has been bad for the reputation of glasgow and manchester both cities it will take a little longer to restore the reputation is that we have previously
the chinese army has increased its rescue efforts in the area affected by the earthquake it's believed forty thousand people like dead or buried alive under the rubble nineteen british tourists who were visiting the region in china where the earthquake struck have been found safe the british ambassador save they were in the wolong area famous for its panda reserve this is a massive operation by the chinese authorities because ten million people are affected
exactly that the first and the chinese have put number on it
they said ten million out of
population of twenty million the people's liberation army is co ordinating the rescue efforts they're one of the biggest armies and the world even for them this disaster seems to be too much to handle it's stretching their resources very thinly this morning
the chinese authorities put out
plea to the public asking them for basic rescue equipment they need shovels hammers anything that can help them to get to those trapped people there are many tens of thousands across the region who have been buried under rubble there are many more who have been spending at least three nights now out in the rain and cold without proper food and water a desperate situation which even china can't cope with on its own
lots of foreigners caught up in that area including some british tourists what can you tell us about the nineteen who have been found
there was a great deal of worry about these tourists but earlier this morning the authorities manage to airlift thirty three tourists british tourists americans and french tourists from his nature reserve at the top of sichuan there is a beautiful part of china it's home to one of the most important giant panda breeding centres in the world it's very popular popular with tourists that area like many parts of sichuan had been cut off with no communications however the authorities manage to get in there with a helicopter most tourists are now safe and sound and
happened so quickly
the risk was gone
december he was incubating the disease for so long he didn't know about it from your research and there is very moving moment where you are talking about the the fact that you sit by his bedside reading and reading all the research you can how many people do we know could be incubating this
i talked to one of the world experts he reckons one in a thousand of us are incubating it
how do we find out
it was on inside out in the south
yes we have had four people that have logged on l. have hundreds of people come forward with inside information agricultural workers industrial scientists people that prepared the feed for the cattle and even journalists journalists never share stories with other journalists but even journalists have come forward so my main thrust now is to find out i know who killed my son my main thrust is to make these publicly and legally accountable for my dear boy's avoidable death
i know you are focusing a lot on the campaign there must be an image of him that you hold on to
put in the blue bin l. l. know you mustn't put anything it has to be stuff that is dry
we have to save the planet i said he's saved the planet he served five years in world war two she said i'm sorry the only thing we could do was to put an assistant on so they can come in and collect the bin it's bad enough him trying to take the bin outside let alone having to bring it in with the rubbish still left inside it
we wanted to show you didn't we the front page of the daily express again it is about recycling and bins and ministers pushing ahead with plans for pay as you throw bin taxes days after gordon brown signalled they would be axed five schemes are being rolled out across the country which could slap up to one thousand year on every family that fails to recycle enough let's talk to peter robinson who is director of the recycling charity waste watch he's like all of us he pays his council tax and he is a customer and he is ninety six
he has particular needs which unfortunately the council didn't meet to start off with in this particular situation the council has got an assistance service for people like lenny now they know his needs they are trying to help i think part of the problem there is one side didn't know the other side's needs so it is about communication and how councils can help their customers to use the services better
i think everybody is trying to recycle it does seem to be that the councils may be being a little too draconian when it comes to the rules and the regulation we heard about the bin that wouldn't close and the guy was fined and refused to pay the fine it got bigger and bigger we hear lots of people writing in to us saying we are doing our best please don't penalise us
actually quite misinformed first of all there is not a proposal to bring a new tax it is a proposal to change the way that people pay for their waste collections people pay through their council tax currently and it's a flat rate everyone pays the same amount regardless of how much you recycle so the proposal is to penalise those who won't recycle but to give incentives to those who will so if you recycle as much as you can you can recycle up to seventy five per cent of the normal household bin you will pay less in your council tax
if you're wheezing and sneezing your eyes are streaming you knows his stuff up you will not need me to tell you that one in ten londoners suffers from hay fever have there been any breakthroughs at all in the treatment of hay fever over the years have you found and the prevention or cure that works for you we're talking hay fever on my show
on to the larger pan that where we were not sure whether that panda was going to out of the end closure or whether somebody was going to go into an enclosure to be with that panda we were waiting for that to happen when suddenly we heard this horrendous noise you just cannot describe what it is like it was a huge noise thailand shook underneath the first thing we all thought to do was to run
if we have a flexible hours i will be able to go back to work as soon as possible maniac and put my child into day care maybe i can put my child into day care
i can see it working in manufacturing you have got shift work maybe solicitors maybe doctors in the retail environment i do not know
at it is a good idea the days of nine to five were gone you need to be adaptable
most people i know in the business profession prefer to pick up the slack or people have got families because they respect that when they have families it will be dealt with in the same way
some of your views let us hear from ban may running an it consultancy and andrea mature who works flexible hours and jean a claw how did you do it at it was about two months ago
children's welfare charity you have got thirty children expect thirty people in your company
he had good employer recognises that to be flexible is really important every good employer fundamentally we support flexible working this is another government legislation affecting employee rights it is all very expensive and that ministers are the heavy as much as we would all like to be able to agree to every request for a flexible working we can only be a good employer if we have got people to deliver the service to her clients and therefore maintain is similarly asked you for flexible working hours you'll have to give it to them a regulations in but the regulators require us to give it consideration they do not require us to agree to every case bak the regulations require us to give it consideration recruiting staff in it is very difficult we cannot offer flexible working yes we're a little bit
some employers would say there in the business of employing people for the benefit of the company not for the benefit of the workers
definitely i can understand that i was originally going to go full time i had to say it was not financially viable for me put that clearly down was going to need to negotiate part time hours
in fewer working more hours you get paid more if you are
i would have got less help with my child care because of the child tax credit system
you can ask for flexible working but it does not necessarily mean business is going to give it to you will it make that much difference in the workplace businesses like you could say thanks for asking but no
it does not mean having to work next day is less days flexible hours could main thing and the school run or line people to work from home occasionally flexible working is not necessarily about last days
small businesses are not compelled to do it if employees want to work fewer days are fewer hours and employees employers are not prepared to give it to them it won't change anything
this right has existed for parents up to the age of six we are extending this to sixteen ninety per cent of cases applied for so far have been accepted
turn up when you want them to if this one was real and i give it bred i probably would not be doing it any favours red is not very good for them confusion reigns what should be be feeding skinner why not
now the thing with bread it won't do birds any harm but it won't do them a lot of good it doesn't hold a lot of nutritional value and when they are busy fielding their young they need food with energy in it there are more alternatives to bread that are easy easy to come by
let's check these out these birds reason real
very nice indeed why is this
good selection of foods for birds
we have had questions from viewers one kieran says is it appropriate to feed food to birds which have eggs in it such as cake and pasta
the thing with cake and pasta they are cooked it has egg but won't cause them problem and if you crumb things up small and make sure they are in small pieces it will it will be really beneficial
michael says some supermarkets seem not to be selling bird feed at the moment any thoughts on that
feeding birds at all times of the year is vital we would encourage supermarkets to sell it all year around there is no more important time than another
it is a beautiful thing when you have birds in the garden if you leave out banana try and peel it
good point well done tim we have had e. mails you know you were saying the chickens you put feed out for the chickens and other birds were getting in and we were saying we should have a pin code
it broke the world record for
i'm delighted
when you look at it now what are your thoughts
i looked at it so much lately and i love it each time i look at it
does it feel like you
it was through my friend who freud was a performance artist and he worked for lucian and that was it really i suppose lucian got use today painting large people by painting lee
did he say lie on that sofa take your kit off and i will get eye easele off
he didn't ask me really he mentioned it to lee he said to lee tell her to start next week i went up there and unfortunately my first picture there were four paintings the first one wasn't the sofa it was the floorboards
how much did you get paid
a lovely lunch and taken out
i've just seen it now when the painting was painted it was in the paper a few times and i got used to to it then when people are shock i'm shocked that they are shocked because it seems normal
the bailiffs came around one time and looked around the house looking for something to take and there was a print there wasn't there that
now she is getting ideas
perhaps i could sell my body to other painters it is not really a career is it
we shall forward the e. mails sue because you will be getting a load of them now her debut album tuesday night music club propelled her on to a global stage in the spring of nineteen ninety four a string of instantly recognisable hits that followed sheryl crow became one of the finest female singer songwriters of her generation she sold thirty million albums worldwide and recorded her sixth studio album and she is here with us before we have a chat here is a listen to her latest single which is called now that you're gone
i can see heaven see it over the plain and if i start running now i think i can make it and never look back again your face is all around me your keys are in my hand and everywhere i go i try to remember exactly who i am
and she is here sheryl crow
when you had greatest hits album there is lot of water under the bridge since then
yes a lot of water a lot of life experience
with breast cancer that i started making the record the process was i recorded the album in my home i have a farm out in nashville it was really nice it was isolated and i had a three month old baby when i started making the record so there was a lot of life experience in forming this record
just in terms of your cancer how are you now
did you have the cancer did you think that was it for while for
your singing career it must be
devastating thing
over the year and a half you got stronger and thought about getting into the studio and doing writing
is stuff about iraq on there you are firm on that what is your view on that
do you feel some of that coming towards you as an individual because you're american
well over the course of the last seven years i travelled a lot outside of the states and also lived outside the states quite a bit and i think the perception of americans now is very damaged by this administration and the way the war has been handled the fact that we even went to a war i find to be aggrieved because in my estimate aches it was really a lot of deception that the american people were handed by the greed affew people now we are embarking on a new period in our history we will be able to resurrect our good time it has been demoralising
it is only interesting to me in so far as it relates to us as people there is an argument for looking at where you are in your history and knowing that whoever is leading your country is a pretty fair depiction of who we are as people there is no mystery or accident that durb durb george bush is leader we were asleep at the wheel and people are waking up
a lot of of speculation as to whether it was fixed or botched or exactly
who won it
it is intriguing that you live in nashville do you see yourself as a country artist your music doesn't strike me that way
record sales are really down and it is difficult to get played at radio now unless you are a dance artist or r. and amp b. and country music has made a a a swing towards being more popular music although i don't get played that much at country radio i feel an afin affinity with the art form
why did you live in nashville
because my family live down there and i adopted a little boy
what is his name
why and the wyatt
how old is he
we will come and see you play in hyde park what date is the concert
cheering for you as will wyatt
he has no choice
it is a lovely album as well the latest fired apprentice will be here shortly who is it
we won't reveal it we are we are going to have a look at what's happening where you are
this task was lost on the first day and it is because you did not recognise what this was about the captured audience and the passionate customers sarat for the past eight weeks there has been lots of suggestions that you actually do not do anything your arguments are always very confusing you have alienated customers that is the feedback michael i have got a list as long as my arm about the apologies putting your hands up i do not know how many more times i can listen to that nonsense i am in a dilemma as to who is going to go one thing i am sure of who is going right now sarah you're fired
morning when you get the bullet you know that you really are in the firing line everybody goes pretty quickly but you must think what run istria mind
he just did not know what is going to happen next you don't know who is looking at one minute you think he is not going to fire me the next seconds you think i do not know where this is going did not perform well in the boardroom that is why i went
it is not down to that it is down to how you manage all the tasks we get this tape and it leaves a little bit off at the end we did not lull until this morning he was fired i thought michael was going to be here l. really did
when i went into the boardroom i did not really pack my suitcase because i really did not think i was going to get fired simply because i really worked hard on that task and i thought the major fundamental flaw was the choice of dresses
they are very expensive dress years if i am going to spend that much money on a dress i would want the expert they're selling the jets ours is have the prize selling the dress
having convinced michael and i that it would be a good idea to go for a middle range dresses l. had not the scene the gesture that helen went to see so i could not make a judgment on them where to go with what she said
they had the ian stewart dress leaflet they knew exactly what they wanted they were asking us about them because he was already well known people do not just to an instant few grand purchase they think about it prior we had some tacky wedding dresses which were difficult to shift
he sold a five if that is down to alex
we did not sell them because the dresses were good looking we saw them because alex was good looking
you are both absolutely hopeless at selling cakes
can i have a think
almost going of god
a very nice but i need to speak to the group
is there something we can pay the deposit then take then talk to the ground
she was quite pushy trying to get at deposit at a bus it put me off a little bit
to be fair it was not just you either here is michael using his charm you'll have to pay two hundred more for a traditional cake and it will be dull this is your wedding you have to take your chance in life he lost the sale as well this viewer says go off like a machine gun
been a lot of really nasty commons were due in particular people say that you were lazy the girls turning against it why was that
i was quite shocked when they said that because i do not think i was lazy at all they did not going there with the strategy her game plan up my sleeve thought if i worked hard at it wreaked hasker would get through maybe even get the job when they said lazy i thought that is a complete lie took a rubbish
you have got a very nice personality but in business terms it possibly get overshadowed and also because you her smaller than the others i think they crowd you out a little bit
i understand where you're coming from and i agree with you l. should have defended you have it not myself a bit more and maybe been a bit louder and maybe more aggressive but i was just natural in there
now is your opportunity to say what do you think of the other people what do you think of claire
quite loud in your face
actually at think he is quite honest he will say something to your face as opposed to back stabbing or bitching
knows what she is doing
got a lot to prove
what do you think you learned from the whole experience
i have learned looking at myself back in the boardroom the mental and emotional stress got to me quite a lot l. just need to start defending myself a little bit more speaking at featuring people know what i'm doing l. was working quietly really hard at the task people do not realise how much you have put in until you tell them
a shame you have to shout and scream to get on
may be not shout and scream but in the house people say what they are good at
you a barrister aren't you you should know how to argue
i knew how to defend other people and you had a stand up for myself as partick manager but i think the emotional and mental stress got so much for me towards the end were all these lies were coming out and i was this and i was lazy i could not take any more maybe it was the
i do not regret it but i will never
and strangest of all a long horned cowfish

hello there welcome to newsround first up rangers' dream of winning four trophies is over they were beaten in the uefa cup final by russian side zenit saint petersburg and manchester there was trouble on the streets fans clashed with police when a big screen set up in the city centre stopped working around thirty people were arrested in china ten million people have been affected by the earthquake which hit sichuan province on monday flattening entire villages thirty thousand troops have been sent to help that the rescue operation bringing food and water and searching for survivors nearly fifteen thousand people are known to have been killed and another twenty six thousand are still trapped in rubble you probably normally try to avoid them if you can but have you thought of being nice to nettles it is actually be nice to a nettle week now so are the stingers all bad lizo has got more nettles are not the nicest of plants they do not look that pretty and they have got a nasty sting loads of you have probably got too close to them at some point in time
but our nettles that bad do they have a softer side this is a man who
what should
and if the kids can keep a secret then they'll win a load of prizes but first they have to pass the kind of challenges that'd have your nana quaking welcome to hider in the house hello my darlings and welcome to the best show on this channel at this time it is of course the unmissable hider in the house
pretty simple stuff for an intelligent man only thing is all these instructions are in completely the wrong order
you've got them upside down oh hang on a minute i know what's going on here you're trying to impress this week's celebrity because she used to be a famous diy makeover presenter that's what you're up to don't be ridiculous
anyway she's not in yet is she i'm not finished doing this
not yet but i wouldn't get your hopes up because this messy monstrosity looks like it'll collapse
in my hand i have the mission file it contains all the information on this week's hider family in fact we probably know more about them than they do very soon you will too let's do it roll the family video file this week's lucky family are the closses

well dad thinks he's taking part in a show called big kidz where kids get to be grown ups and grown ups get to be kids so he'll be learning to tap dance and thinks the kids will be doing boring grown up stuff like this
to make it more believable we've roped in a big kidz presenter this is kate her job is to get dad to do silly things all in the name of big kidz
he doesn't know the kids are going to hide a celebrity for two days
and that's not all dad's seen the show so if he spots us he's gonna know it's hider in the house so we have to go undercover too
wow i think we better keep an eye on dad he's pretty sharp and will definitely know if something's up
will dad bust us or will the kids pull off the ultimate challenge and win a shed load of prizes
if i could play a prank on anybody it would be my dad cos he's always scaring me when i'm reading or something

the briefcase yeah oh i've forgotten about that i've moved on since then that's good to know well em
yeah sure all right see you bye see you ugh
all by myself
oh silly joel he's still missing that briefcase
this is jackanory junior hi i'm tamsin do your parents ever do silly things things that make you so embarrassed you just want to jump back into bed and hide your head under the covers well this is the story of a boy who had the most embarrassing parents in the whole world it's called explorer trauma indiana brown was born in a tent deep in a tropical rainforest a year later he took his first steps at the top of mount everest when he was two indiana learned to swing with monkeys on jungle vines by the time he was three he was swimming with dolphins in the indian ocean but when he was four his nan put her foot down
thump
they had become worse than ever
yeah phoenix barnes as well he was the two year old missing with his parental guardian he has been found too
later she's captured on c. c. t. v. at
busy station in london that's over four hundred miles away sasha's home is in penicuik on the outskirts of edinburgh
sasha was always a cheeky little girl but always bright with it really friendly with everybody she was a bit of a handful but it was a handful realising she was a teenager i've been a teenager and you have to go along with whatever they do
although sasha lives in care her mum is in daily contact until one day just nine months ago i phoned up the unit at five hundred fifteen and talked to a care worker he said i'll go and her for you i asked her if she wanted come up for her tea because she had been put for her tea every night for the last three weeks he said she would phone back l. never got that call until one thousand at night when they told me they thought sasha had run away she was reported missing to the police officer mclain knows fifteen year old sasha and her family
there's no news for three days then on october fifteenth sasha finally makes contact
two point oh oh that afternoon we got that call off sasha the call wasn't withheld it was a thirty second call where she said she was happy and safe and not coming home
yeah we thought
she was still up at the house so so she has not gone missing for a length of time before but she had overstayed or not let you know she was coming home
it was just the usual when i saw she wasn't there the next day it was one of these she's done it again stayed over without letting us know it wasn't a major thing until the next evening when i thought she's messing around now we have to phone and they said she had walked home the previous evening
this has happened in spain so why do you need help from people who are here
we live in very large english community they get up in the morning go to buy their newspaper like everybody else does and there was nothing in the paper about it a lot of people still don't know about it even though it's four and a half months a lot of people in spain watch this programme we
it's all over the irish news and the spanish news our community is mostly british expats
that's why even in the video that's what she is that's the way she goes on she's just a normal teenager
as a
out where urpl in friends yeah spain
where she may have gone
treating it not as a runaway case
they have said themselves they're
i know you're doing stuff on the internet as well
i have to say a lot of that is because i'm not great with a computer a lot of that is family and our friends in spain in england and in ireland they've set up sites and all of them facebook bebo they've done all that
so it's not just people living there over the summer as well people will be going to spain
especially now this time of year where apartments may have been locked up for the winter and people are only starting to come down again now it's those people as well that will be able to keep a look out
how are you coping because it's been a long time now
ronnie has been missing since sixth march since then we've started the process of trying to find robbie searching his work obviously speaking to his friends going to his local haunts at the moment we've got nowhere with that
robbie is a hard working man he works for local rail company he has been with his present partner quite a number of years quite a private person but having said that drinks locally at some of the same pubs he has done for some considerable time
robbie's local is in the centre of town
with a friend to do their own search robbie loves the holiday town and she thinks he might have headed here
we've been abroad we've been to jerusalem loved benidorm
blackpool she's hoping someone might have spotted him
seen this person before but i will put this up
two years ago robbie was diagnosed with cancer he is now in remission but janice knows it's important he still attends regular hospital appointments
i wonder if you can help me in any way as regards putting this poster up
yeah no problem
janice and robbie have been inseparable for years she's struggling without him
i miss his personality his laughter the jokes we were sandwiched together absolutely sandwiched together i'll be at a loss basically
the line that this might be the day he comes home
if you have any idea where robbie might be or can help andrew from missing live let's get a couple of updates on steven hadley we have had a lot of calls
yeah we have had about forty calls so far good potential sightings we still need more people to call in but yeah
that's potentially quite interesting all the sightings have been passed on to the place
off thailand we haven't seen any calls yet
important if anyone has seen him around the twenty fifth of february he was there
yeah family and friends are desperate to hear anything if you think you have anything
any of these people please seen any of these people please call sergeant dave brewster from the met police is with us now with some more good news what's this then rodney holden who was featured on the show last week he turned up yesterday and as a result of the t. v. programme his dad has been in touch they haven't seen each other for fifteen years
that's fantastic news
you have double whammy if you like that's fantastic we couldn't ask more more not only has he been found but his dad who has been separated for this amount of time has gotten in contact as a result of this programme he watched this programme and recognised his son
in order to do your checks have you liaised with the american authorities
in my experience that looks like he he could be known as someone completely different
he may have a different date a different date of birth
so get in contact and let us know if he is safe and well if you know where he is he's her favourite brother but for years she didn't know where stuart was or how to get in contact but now she's found him this is how surt and susan were reunited when susanne seymour daughter died eight years ago she was left alone
she was born with a very bad skin disorder since she died i have been lost nobody to look after apart from these lot and then you get the days you don't really get out of bed
the search for his relatives starts with the salvation army
this is a copy of the form that was sent in by stuart to look for his sister and as you can see it just simply says the name on the top her date of birth and the last known address the main part was that the date of birth was there that was helpful the last known address was helpful
the salvation army sent me letter we're looking for suzanne seymour and the date of birth and the last known address stuart knew is this you within half an hour of getting that letter i was on the phone and he was crying l. was crying he said can i come home i said yep get you next week this brother analyster are reunited he now lives with suzanne and she looks after him full time he was on his own he's had a stroke he's got nobody but with me having joanne i always look looked after somebody ed now i look after him and he keeps me right but he's looking better
he's talking better we have had
couple of games of chess for the first time in what forty years l. l. beat him just a few months ago he wasn't able to get out of bed now he's well on the road to recovery
it's been great having him home he's getting better every day getting stronger
a brilliant story throughout the series you have been sending us your reunited stories dianne wakefield's husband was adopted and he knew nothing at his brothers until two thousand six he now has met david tony is unwell but they're hoping to meet sue dianne ives was adopted and now reunited with her birth parents and six siblings she never had that was in nineteen ninety one they'd emigrated to the united states in nineteen fifty six they're all close and keep in regular
contact contact brilliant
if you would like to brilliant share your story there are only a couple of days left in this series but we'll save all your stories for when we're back next spring your help is needed to find abdul faye who disappeared on march tenth last seen at five hundred p. m. at birch hill hospital where he's a voluntary patient he then vanished he was wearing a black track suit at the time if you have any idea where he may be please call a numb has wrapped a birthday present for her son every year he has been missing so far thirteen gifts await his return marcus rigby comes from the lake district as a teenager he experiments with recreational drugs which affect him badly at nineteen doctors prescribe him medication to control his paranoia by his mid twenties marcus wants to put his problems behind him
he decided to go to bible school he started in march nineteen ninety four and went through to the end of that summer term
he was on you can't just stop you have to be weaned off slowly because they're quite powerful drugs really so he just stopped taking it
after just a few months without his medication marcus' symptoms start to return his family hardly hear from him
he said he wanted to go off and sort himself out find work and make a new start those are all very positive thing but at the same time we were concerned because he hadn't been particularly happy before he left he was
he was quite closed i suppose and we only had a very brief conversation and me just asking where he was going and him not choosing to tell me but just before we did part i said to him can i give you a hug and there was a look of pain but he portsmouth is the last recorded place we've got for him
after no contact his mum turns to police for help
soon after i registered him as missing a bank statement came for him to our home address which i opened a cheque had gone through the account the bank manager got a copy of the cheque and there was an address on the back dorset police were asked to follow that up in weymouth
when i went to do a discreet inquiry to check if he was living there he had moved on so we just missed the contact the search goes on for marcus and it's six years before his family get any news
there were a few sightings of him from southampton which came from reliable sources one was a guy i think about mark's age who said he'd spent time with mark and that mark had changed his name still mark but he changed his surname to smith he said he'd known mark for a period of time but that had been a few months in the past when the police followed it up he'd moved on
marcus is now forty although his family has had no contact with him for thirteen years he's still in their thoughts
i buy present every birthday and christmas for him that was nineteen ninety nine a birthday present i think it's a jumper probably this one a pair of socks i think my dear son mark your twenty ninth birthday so that's nineteen ninety six it's very poignant really usually feel quite upset you know because you miss that person so much i'm sorry yeah it's really bad news
and marcus' mum who you just saw there mary is with us good morning
good morning
is it important for
one day you really believe he's going to be able to open those presents
because you'd been to collect his stuff from college did you have any indication he was going to go
i know over the years you have had various appeals haven't you and on one of the particular times information
yes and that was quite a strong sighting it was after the last series of missing
yes it was
also some people seem to think he may have changed his name what do you know
i suppose it's positive also in that he is making friends
yes evidently
i would say he won't look any differents than the photos you have
what do you think he might be doing what was he interested in
he was quite artistic he used to draw and do pottery but is very good with it things so anything along those lines perhaps
thirteen years on is such long time what would you say to him about if he feels i don't know embarrassed about getting in touch
i would say don't let anything stop you because the welcome on the
you've seen marcus or can help in any way to bring him home please call missing people andrew is still with us what's latest you have for us
she's the sixteen year old from blackpool with that distinctive play boy bunny tattoo on her neck what sort of response have you had about her
we've had about thirteen calls since yesterday
calls now on robey smith who was shown today
we've had four calls on him so far the family is desperate for news
we're just coming up to a bank of public pay phones on our left hand
side we're aware that sasha made
no one knows who sasha is with and how she's surviving in london
she's fifteen obviously anybody who is in strange city fifteen years of age we have great concerns for them as have her family but we just have to keep very open mind we know she has family in the london area but not in london itself we really just don't know where she is at the moment obviously we're very concerned for her wellbeing
after a newspaper appeal there's a second sighting of sasha at another busy station this time it's waterloo
a member of the public called in to say that she saw sasha in the area of the information boards she described sasha as wearing a dark coat tight jeans and ugg style boots this is the area that sasha came from from the underground walking along with information boards to our right she was sighted at this kiosk and that's where she was last seen
and neglect going on l. was responsible for bringing up my younger brothers l. ran away from all of that l. was to go and live with my dad down in torquay l. only lived met with this guy once when i was twelve he walked out when i was born i stayed with him for a year then doubts came in place why did this guy abandon me and also the stuff from my past with my mum came flooding back in my head i couldn't cope and i needed to escape from it all to get away and to be able to deal with things on
i went to stay with friends but there are only so many times before you can stay with someone and it gets too much and they need their family space back i'd go and stay with one friend tell the police where i was staying and leave again and not tell anyone l. was staying with strangers i was approaching people on the street have you got a spare bed for the night
these weren't one night two night runaways we're talking three months or so you're gone that's a long period of time obviously you were school
you've turned it around now tell us what you do now
like missing people or the children society or the other fantastic helplines that are there then they can be advised on what is best even if you know someone for a long time you don't know what their true intentions are
i'd hate to think that in fourteen or fifteen years he'd feel how i felt my main concern now is giving him the best childhood i can
is there anything you could say to any of ourpl young runaways who may be watching as to how to get in touch

that's right megan give it a tickle behind the ears look these animals have very long necks hello this is biffa she's a giraffe giraffe's like eating bananas too with the skins on there's another animal to see as well this one's a bit smaller
the animal in here is covered in scales
a snake
well done we've got a snake in here but it's not a poisonous snake smith is a royal python
can i stroke smith when he comes down here
just have a little look at him as he goes by
sue's letting alexander and lisa stroke the snake very gently to see what it feels like
he's got beautiful scales on him
he has lovely patterns it helps him to hide in the wild all those splodges just a stroke
i love you snake
no nothing's wrong then why the long face it's just that max has gone to a canal with emma and her granny i wish we could go too
it's only an old canal fizz but it's lovely there bella
you see these pretty old fashioned boats chugging up and down
the boats are called narrow boats they're long and thin so they can travel down canals people live on them too and paint them in bright colours like this hey where are you going emma come back please that's right now hold hands again you should never run along the path beside the canal you might fall in the water or trip over one of these mooring ropes they stop the boat from floating away but they can be dangerous if you tripped over one you could hurt yourself or fall into the canal dum de dum oh dear fizz and bella don't look very happy like me when i've lost my bone pill the beans ma is visiting a canal and we want to go with him i'd love to go to a canal yeah i love feeding the ducks don't you but we're not standing right by the edge of the water why because it's so easy to fall in it's not like the swimming pool there are no steps here so if you fall in it can be hard to get out it's much safer to stand well back all the lovely trees and fields
don't you wish you could be by a canal yes more than anything else
but i'd stand back from the edge
gloom arooni have you got tummy ache it makes me look like that
no jakey we're just a bit fed up because we want to go to the canal and see the boats and locks
locks do they have ginormous keys no jakey
it's not a door lock it's for the boats i watched one working once
yes a lock is an interesting place you see that water gushing in over there it's lowering this boat down so it can travel to the next bit of canal but a lock is also a very dangerous place that's why emma's standing there out of the way with her granny look how deep it is if you fall into a lock it's almost impossible to get out so you must keep well away from locks now emma we must get a move on your grandad's taking us for a ride on his narrow boat let's go and get our life jackets
i don't believe this now they're having a boat ride too
hello it's me judy hi max jump in the car and join us' max says would you like to join him and emma for the boat ride yes right before we set off let's just remember how to be safe by a canal it's fun to play with your friends every day you want to make it last forever but keep in your head what the tweenies said then we'll all play safe together yes we'll all play safe together
chug chug chug chug down by the canal chug chug chug chug watching boats on the canal
don't run down the path it's a race you can't win stay back from the edge in case you fall in
the lock is where you should take the most care
it's fun to play with your friends every day we'll all play safe together

the night is black and the stars are bright and the sea is dark and deep
buying at auction is exciting and nerve wracking
and it's so fast in seconds you could be the owner of a house
so if you're thinking of buying at auction it's best to be prepared let's find out what happened
when the hammer fell at the auctions on today's programme
i investigate why this cottage in berkshire has had its day well here's the house on first glance it looks perfect
this derby semi looks great for an eighty year old i know people who specifically look for nineteen thirties properties because they really like the build quality and the design of them
you wouldn't think i'd get lost in this little house in basingstoke however it just feels like a warren of doors and look there's just cupboards everywhere
all these properties have been sold at auction and we'll find out who bought them and what they paid when they went under the hammer sold
personally i think there is money to be made here i think that somebody will buy this with a view in mind to increase the size of the properties here or enhance the plans that have already been passed
it seems the development potential of this plot has not gone unnoticed
although we haven't been conducting erm viewings inside the property we've been inundated with enquiries from people who've requested the legal pack
in the lead up to the auction there's been a great buzz about this plot let's see if it lives up to the hype when it goes under the hammer
the man in brown turns out to be andrew he's half of a building team the other half is philip they've been in property for a long time they started off as estate agents which is how they met then eight years ago they set up their own company to work on small scale building projects and have been going strong ever since congratulations so how intent were you on buying this lot at auction
we were very very keen because we liked the location and it was the sort of development we'd prefer to work on something we enjoy and we were able to buy it before getting to the limit we'd set ourselves
was this always going to be a development opportunity
oh yes yeah the value of the bungalow wasn't worth doing up so it was always going to be if we secured it building two new houses here
right let's have a look at these then
andrew and philip were attracted to the site's potential because of the many good schools nearby which should appeal to family buyers they have been friends and successful business partners for many years so i'm keen to find out how they share the workload
it works very well because we've both been involved in property for a long time so we both get involved in the design matters and then we very much like to get our hands dirty and get down and dig the footings out
so how does it compare being an estate agent to actually doing the job you know renovating buying selling finding locations
well we've seen it from both sides of the fence if you like cos being estate agents we'd seen it from a selling point of view and now we like to get our hands dirty with the various projects that we get involved in
working for yourself you see something through from the beginning through to when the people are going to move in so and we tend to try and look at plans and the specifications of houses and look at them on the basis that we want them to be individual and something hopefully a little special
i am dying to know what you're going to do with this on first looks it looked like you shouldn't be pulling this down but i can see the maths behind it shall we go out to the garden and have a chat about it great yeah on the way out the boys couldn't resist telling me that the two new houses are likely to be an environmentally friendly timber framed design what else do they plan to do so this house is coming down are you going to be tweaking the outline plans that you already have
yes the consent was for a two bedroom and the plans that we're submitting is for a four bedroom
so you've moved the partitions from a two bed to create a four bed aren't they small
no the rooms are still good upstairs it's just that the two bedrooms that were there on the original plans were disproportionate they were enormous and it really did beg to be better planned and still get four bedrooms
anything that you're a little concerned or worried about with this
as always a certain amount of trepidation with the local authority in terms of building what we would like to and finding it acceptable to them inevitably there'll be negotiation with them and hopefully we can come up with something that is acceptable to them and that we are happy and look forward to building
i should have loved you better from the start
the real benefit of the house here is the fact it gives a blank canvas for the owners to work with they're not having to take away someone else's efforts they can start from scratch
this particular style of home was built on a number of streets in this area the majority of them have had extensions normally ground floor to the rear some two storey to the side and some attic conversions an owner here would only really choose to extend if it suited their purposes they're unlikely to make a profit by investing in that extension
well not a lot of surprises with this one it is exactly as you might expect a real solid little semi let's see who spotted the opportunity at the auction
now that's what i call an exciting auction but the lady who finally won the battle was ruth who's brought business partner sally along to check out her purchase who'd have thought the house would fetch forty two thousand over the guide price of sixty so how was the auction for you very exciting i went over my budget
but it was worth it what was your budget about ninety eight
are you happy with what you paid then yeah yeah so why did you pick this particular house then
i love the house i love it it's got a nice feel it's a nice little road it's quiet my daughter's school's round here i'm renting at the moment so i'd rather get out of the renting market and move into here for a short while before we sell it on and then start again
so you are buying it to do up primarily but you are going to live in here in the meantime
yes that's right for possibly about six months and see what's on the market and start again i'm in the middle of a chain reaction
ruth who's a divorcee and part time swimming teacher needed something to supplement her small income and help raise her fourteen year old daughter property developing emerged as an option
i was waiting for a divorce settlement to come through and the job centre phoned me up out of the blue and offered me some retraining and the only thing i could think about was possibly a bit of property developing
right so what was the training you did i did a plastering course
a bricklaying course and a plumbing course
were you very practical before this is this the sort of thing you did
no not at all i hadn't done anything i hadn't even rewired a plug before
so the idea was then that you would do all the work on the properties that you bought in the future
most of it yes so you've got the skills then so what happened next i went to an auction a couple of years ago bought my first house totally gutted it and here we are again
right so was that a success your first project
it sounds like the training's paid off and ruth's confident she can tackle this renovation with plenty to fix she should be in her element so what's she got planned
i'm going to put new windows in not all of them but just some of them knock through from the kitchen to the dining room to make a big dining kitchen french doors in the dining room and maybe eventually put a third bedroom in the loft it depends on the budget but that's probably something for the future
and the budget
yeah is that including your kitchen and things like that it is and the bathroom yes seven thousand to eight thousand does sound very tight to me but ruth isn't tackling this project alone business partner sally will also be involved sally what will you do on the project i'm going to start stripping the walls down
so getting the lovely woodchip off the walls that's a heck of a job and the ceiling yeah then they'll be ready for ruth to plaster
what do you think of ruth's new found skills the plastering and the bricklaying
we'll find out later what impact ruth's handiwork has on this house i don't foresee any major problems but i do wonder if the budget of seven thousand to eight thousand is enough for all the work well ruth has picked herself up after a divorce been on that course which i think is a fantastic idea to learn those basic skills and is now definitely embarking on the career as a property developer how will she and sally get on with this place you can find out later in the show
coming up this house in basingstoke is in an area of high demand so at the right price this could be a great buy
back in derby swimming instructor ruth goes the extra length
the project's taken longer than we thought i suppose you always run into problems
theme from the terminator by brad fiedel
andrew and philip have succeeded where many developers fail where the cottage once stood there are now two new houses
here i am signed sealed delivered i'm yours
the old bungalow sat just almost where that front door is there both houses are almost exactly the same this one's running about six weeks behind the other it's still got to be decorated and internal doors generally a second fix has got to be done but we're very happy with the general outcome and the situation and how they marry in with the original chalet at the end of the drive there
here i am baby whoa
signed sealed delivered i'm yours
although they're not quite ready for delivery yet two houses for the price of one is quite a result i'm looking forward to seeing inside
on the first floor we've got the master bedroom with an en suite shower room one bedroom another bedroom and then the family bathroom here and then we come through into what we think is a bonus room when we originally purchased the site we were able to go back with revised planning and as much as the appearance of the property hasn't changed at all we've managed to fit a fourth bedroom over the top of the garage using velux windows
the houses have been designed with a family in mind downstairs there are two large living areas a small cloakroom and a modern kitchen diner
through here we've got the kitchen obviously and breakfast room which we've made into a conservatory there we're going to have the dishwasher and over on this side there's going to be a fridge freezer we've ceramic tiled the floor it's going to have heating in the conservatory here and we've put a glass roof which on a nice bright day it's nice to see the sun
it just goes to show the size of the plot that this single property stood on now even with two houses both still have a good garden space inside the quality of finish is high with solid timber doors modern fixtures and fittings and a lot of natural light originally andrew and philip thought it would cost about one hundred eighty thousand to build both houses a year on how are the numbers adding up
we've kept roughly to the budget although we have spent a little more principally because the houses are larger than when we purchased we budgeted we achieved the enhanced planning and so we've had to spend more to build a much larger house basically
i think actually the vendor has looked at his market very well he's looked at the type of people coming into the area he's matched their requirements to what he's built he's certainly done his homework on that
there's a real shortage of this style of property at the price range that we're looking at at the present moment and i feel that this property would certainly attract a great deal of interest as would the one next door
things are looking good so far they spent six hundred fifty three thousand buying the plot and building two brand new four bedroom houses what will the market price be for each one once they're finished
plot one which has the larger plot which is the one we're in now i would say six hundred twenty five and plot number two i would say six hundred
very pleased it was what we were expecting initially when we bought the site obviously the figures wouldn't have been as high as that but in view of the enhanced planning we intend to go to the market with this one at around the six and a quarter mark so yes that confi rmed our own thoughts
on the nail
well andrew may be playing it cool but philip is obviously chuffed at the result by doing their research they knew exactly what market to build for and it's definitely paid off
oh yes it's exactly what we were expecting and we've already got one project to move on to and it will now enable us to buy something else hopefully at auction in the near future
there's no problems with the property itself it needs some modernisation once that's done there will be a marketplace for it the lean to at the back would need to come down the extension of the back of the kitchen possibly remodelled
as these don't come up very often would a buy to let investor be on to a good thing here
the rental value would be approximately seven hundred fifty per calendar month
well a type of house that's popular and doesn't come up for sale very often this could prove to be a good investment the way the property market has risen in recent months to buy a freehold house in an up and coming area like this is becoming a rarity so at the right price this could be a great buy let's see who picked it up at the auction
that winning bid of one hundred fifty thousand was made by alex and his girlfriend nikki alex works for a computer game production company and met nikki through a shared passion for online gaming they've been together for two years and recently began searching for a house what brought them to basingstoke
we're both living in quite expensive areas at the moment and there was no way we could afford to buy where we're living so we've been looking round this area and this come up for auction and we thought well yeah we've seen homes under the hammer it doesn't look that difficult and we thought we'd give it a try
so nikki and alex went to their first auction and paid one hundred fifty thousand for their first house so how much research did you put into buying this property
hours really yeah we came to see it three times we brought his dad along because he's a plumber and then we brought his mum along to have a look as well just get the family on side
definitely let's be honest standing outside the front
looking at the house it's not the most beautiful house i've ever seen how did you feel about it when you first clapped eyes on it
when we first started looking a white fronted house was the last thing we wanted
it was exactly what we didn't want yep and then we came inside and there's just so much room yeah
so what potential can you see nikki here
oh where to start the living room definitely we've got to get rid of the lean to at the back and take the dividing wall there out nice patio doors out into the garden
that's how i saw it you could really bring the garden into the room almost make it another room
same with the kitchen merge the kitchen and utility room to make it a much bigger kitchen depending on their plans nikki and alex
might be able to extend within the permitted development allowed for this house alternatively they'll need to apply for planning permission which means waiting for eight weeks so will this be your first house together
yes it will
so it's a really exciting project for you both isn't it oh definitely
yeah are you both you know
sharing the same tastes in wallpaper and paint and carpet
we tend to agree a lot
pretty much it's been good have you thought about knocking walls down opening up doorways
now why are you laughing
yeah that might be one thing we disagree on tell me tell me i love it
good good bit of gossip
i think i probably want to take out some of the built in storage upstairs there's a big cupboard that's off the master bedroom and there's some others in another bedroom
so who do you think is going to win on this one
i don't know
well watch this space by paying one hundred fifty thousand at the auction alex and nikki almost went to their limit i hope they've kept some money in reserve for the refurbishment so how long do you think it's going to take you overall to get this project completed
with all of the kitchen and the lean to at the back we think probably three months
and what sort of budget have you got to spend on this
including all the fees we have about fifteen thousand left over to get it all done
you've obviously got a lot of work to do here it is very dated how do you both feel about artex because it's everywhere
yep we need to look into how much it's going to cost to get the ceilings skimmed it's not too badly done no it is
i really think it's worth spending the money to do that because i just think it really sort of sets the tone and when you've decorated in here that's going to stick out like a sore thumb yep so who's going to help you do all the work
my dad's a plumber so he's going to help us put in all of the heating pipes cos it's warm air heating in here at the moment and he's got a friend who's a builder
hurrah so he's going to help us with the back
and they've also got a friend who's a plasterer hopefully
so when i come back these ceilings will be beautiful and smooth i can't wait to see how alex and nikki get on decorating their first home they only bought it three weeks ago and now they are officially the proud new owners i've got some really good news for you i had a little phone call outside a little while ago and you've completed on this property today and here are your keys brilliant i hope you have a really happy time it's been lovely meeting you both and good luck thank you thank you buying your first home is a big achievement for alex and nikki it's the start of a new chapter in their lives and they've got big plans for this house i think nikki and alex are really excited about creating their first home together but do they realise just how much work is involved even with friends and family helping out let's hope they're still smiling further down the line you can find out what happens later on in the programme
well making the correct decisions about design for a property isn't just about living with the wrong paint colour
it can affect your profit with the property
but turning your ideas into reality is great fun
but how often do people get it right let's catch up with our purchasers
for some property developing could be the start of a new career but for swimming teacher and single parent ruth it was just an opportunity to supplement her income and pick up some new skills she'd already taken courses in plumbing plastering and joinery so was confident that along with her friend sally she could renovate this two bedroom house in derby with no outside help five months on it appears she's done just that
sisters are doing it for themselves standing on their own two feet and ringing on their own bells the whole house was very damp we had to take the walls from about radiator height down rip all the plasterwork off and the old rendering right back to bare brick
we've had the whole house rewired re render all downstairs we've had partly some new windows and the patio doors basically everything
sisters are doing it for themselves
both sally and ruth have full time jobs but by working evenings and weekends they've transformed this house and made some big improvements
the main change is the french doors we had french doors put in i don't know if you remember there was an old fashioned window so that was ripped out and brand new french doors and a nice window above to give more light and we've knocked through the wall from the dining room to the kitchen to make a big kitchen dining area
and so what we've done in here is stripped the floors back to the original floorboards cos they were in really good condition new electrics radiator we've cleaned up the windows
sisters are doing it for themselves
it's good to see that that tree at the front has been removed but by far the biggest change outside is at the back where ruth has uncovered a much bigger garden than she'd expected
basically the first thing we did was knock down the greenhouse opened up the whole garden by chopping down lots of bushes and trees and thorns thistles and literally doubled the size of the garden
there was lots of potential to extend this property not just out the back but by going into the loft space as well but the girls decided not to do that
yeah we were thinking about extending into the loft but just haven't got the funds to do that the people who buy it have got that choice cos it can be done but it would've taken even longer as well and we want a quick you know a quick turnaround
the budget's gone up to just under ten thousand now basically a lot of it was to do with the gas because we hadn't got any gas in the house we thought we had it was checked and then found to have no gas so that was added expense
with the house almost finished i was expecting to see more furnishings ruth's original plan was to move in so what's changed
we're not going to move in the house is just too far from my daughter's school it's too far for her to walk and she doesn't want me at fifteen to be taking her to school and picking her up every day so the plan is to hopefully sell it quickly and the next house we buy hopefully at auction we'll do it up and move into that one
along with sally's help ruth's worked very hard to renovate this property and made the best of the space available without taking extreme measures she paid one hundred two thousand for it at auction and spent ten thousand turning it around but would she have made more by extending or will two local estate agents think she's done enough
the programme of works that the owners have done is fabulous and the colour schemes the changes in kitchen the removal of the wall in that area all goes to create a really good product
i understand the ladies had thought about extending the property but i'm glad that they haven't i don't think it would have been worth it this is a two bedroom house it is what it is leave it as it is and move onto the next one i think
the one major concern when they come to resell the property will be the original windows at the front of the house they look dated don't give a good first impression and although changing bay windows is expensive it really would make a big difference
the way they have dealt with the kitchen diner is very good as it's a galley kitchen and the way they've opened it up from the dining room it makes it flow through and although it is quite narrow it doesn't seem narrow now they've also brought more light into the room with the french doors at the back and the glass panel that they put in where the door was is a nice touch
with another property on the horizon renting this one out was never an option so after spending one hundred two thousand on it at auction and another ten grand for the renovations how much has ruth made for her five months work
if i was to put the property on the market now i would suggest it should go on at one hundred nineteen thousand nine hundred fifty
i was expecting a bit more than that we had a valuation yesterday and the valuation was one hundred twenty nine thousand nine hundred fifty he said we could even get more than that but for a quick sale put it on for one hundred twenty nine thousand nine hundred fifty so that's quite a lot less than i was expecting
no not put off just getting ready to do the next one
if anything i'd say they're keener than ever and with ruth picking up more and more skills who knows next time she may do the whole house herself
there's no shortage of these white timber clad properties around this part of basingstoke this one was bought at auction for one hundred fifty thousand by nikki and alex to be their first home together the house was very spacious but downstairs it needed serious refurbishment a grotty lean to at the back was rotten and damp and there was definitely one thing i was adamant had to go how do you both feel about artex it's not too badly done no it is when you've decorated in here that's going to stick out like a sore thumb yep six months later let's see what's been achieved the large hallway has seen a splash of paint but behind it that old kitchen is just as bad as before and the lounge hooray the lean to has gone and the artex upstairs the middle sized bedroom has been decorated and looks ready to sleep in the colour scheme of bedroom three has also changed but the really large bedroom has been divided into two smaller rooms so the house is now potentially a four bedroom property how has alex got on with his and nikki's first home has it gone to plan
we've been working on the property for five months so far and we've made a lot of progress but it's taken a lot longer than we'd really hoped it would the old sunroom at the back it really wasn't very good it leaked and really we just decided that after looking at the economics of whether to rebuild it or not we just had to pull it down
along with the trees in the back garden the leaky lean to was knocked down and hung out to dry more a rainy room than a suntrap as nikki explains
this used to be the rain room as you can see it isn't any more we decided that with the potential planning permission that we'd have needed we've got the new patio doors in the extension for the kitchen we really didn't need the extra indoor space i think i can use it much better out here as somewhere to entertain put a nice patio in move the barbeque in and it should be nice
nikki and alex had toyed with taking the brick extension right across the back of the house but didn't think they've recoup the investment if they came to sell and there's plenty of work needed on the existing extension
at the moment the extension's only a single skin so we're having a second skin put up on the outside of the extension we're repairing the roof because at the moment it's got two roofs on it and one of them is not very good and we're levelling the floor
the new kitchen will open right into the extension all at the same level it should be a big room
yes nikki's bought a big american style fridge it looks a bit lonely before the rest of the kitchen is there to join it
the biggest job so far has been putting in the central heating it's meant we've had to take up all the floors upstairs and think about where we want the pipe work to go so we can keep it as hidden as possible
changing the warm air heaters to radiators wasn't easy but well worth it i reckon most of the pipes have been hidden and nikki hasn't had to sacrifice any of her cupboard space
i won on the storage at the moment we decided that it was too much hassle with everything else going on to start ripping out cupboards and remodelling them
they paid one hundred fifty thousand at auction for a three bedroom house but after further investigation it looks like it wasn't originally built that way
when we got the house this was one large bedroom but it already had the separate doorframe and the separate window so we think it was originally two separate rooms so we put the stud wall back and it gives me an office where i can work and it also gives nikki some space where she can do her own thing
the previous owners had recently refurbished the bathroom so that hasn't been changed it's just as well nikki and alex have a friend who's a plasterer some seams were so cracked that the plasterboard had to be totally replaced so with lots of work still to do how's the financial position
i understand their plans are to slightly extend the kitchen out into the single skinned area at the back there's a way to go yet but you can see the finish they'll end up with so that's going to work out well for them
i don't think they have increased or decreased the value by splitting the bedrooms into four as a four bedroom it's likely to attract a family as a three bedroom a first time buyer
they installed a radiator heating system after removing the warm air system it's far more economical and the perfect thing for this property
how much could it be worth if nikki and alex decide to sell remember they paid one hundred fifty thousand at auction for the house and spent about ten thousand on the refurbishment
hang on alex don't forget that figure would be severely dented by the usual deductions if you did decide to sell but i reckon they're going to stay and enjoy this new house and i bet they're pleased that i convinced them to get rid of that artex
oh yes yes
it wouldn't have suited the rest of the house there's no point making the rest of it nice when you've got that on the ceiling
i don't think you'd have forgiven us if we'd kept it
no you're right it had to go we wish nikki and alex lots of luck with their new house and here's to that fabulous kitchen they're planning let's hope it works out well for them
properties are going under the hammer virtually every day of the week
so we really are spoilt for choice
whoo hoo whoo hoo

why did romans live in cities
didn't they settle in the country
why were the roads so straight
how did the romans build them
to the twenty first century sloggio oh and you can cut the master today people in the modern world don't have slaves you can call me rom although i am a master trader and genuinely good bloke and i have an idea that is a masterstroke
wait a minute if there aren't any slaves in the twenty first century then i won't need to carry this sack for you master i mean rom
yes you will i paid your master to borrow you for the day we have important work to do
getting rid of some dodgy gear we could've done that in roman times
yes which is why you are a slave and i'm a businessman people in the twenty first century love all that dodgy quality merchandise yes archaeologists have been digging it up for years oh yes we are taking this to chester
where chester the roman city of deva
one of their museums'll love my bag of goods all in perfect condition
perfect condition
from where i'm sitting this sack is full of old rubbish
sloggio will you stop moaning and start moving
i've got a bad back what did you say i wouldn't mind going back
well you can't why not because we've arrived
next stop twenty first century mind the time gap
is this chester then yes
no not sure watch the merchandise i don't want any breakages do you know i think this is watling street
it don't look much like a street to me i'm trying to concentrate
we need a landmark to help us locate where we are what
like that building up on the hill sloggio ssh
why were roads important in roman times
where was watling street
where are we now is this chester no
that is part of the city wall that used to surround roman verulamium we'll be in chester in no time roman roads take the quickest route how far is it one hundred eighty modern miles
no sloggio it's the other way round modern miles are much longer no time for resting this way no this way
you won't be walking round in circles roman roads are always very straight if we set off in a straight line we'll be in chester eventually
if we use your gadget we might find watling street before night very well sloggio
watling street was the first major roman road to be built in britain it went from richborough in the south to chester in the north passing through london saint albans and wroxeter the other major roman roads were ermine street which ran from london to york and foss way which ran from ilchester to lincoln by the end of the first century the romans had created eight thousand miles of roads across britain roman soldiers dug ditches and filled them with layers of stones the top layers called cambers were curved to allow water to run off into ditches on either side this stopped puddles forming and made the surface last longer
innit noisy here much busier than it was for us romans
yes but we're on watling street now
can't we go to chester in one of those we're going the roman way
i want to see what signs there are of us along watling street we'll see lots of roman things that are two thousand years old
which is how old i'll feel by the time we get there a two thousand year old cart horse clip clop clip blooming clop
this is saint albans amphitheatre it's where we romans used to perform plays and poetry well it was very popular in roman verulamium still looks roman doesn't it
yeah yeah well granted it's not perfect but
well you can still see the stage and where the audience used to sit ah yes
how did you do that
eh oh it's all do it yourself in the twenty first century sloggio no they don't need slaves any more all the gadgets and contraptions they've got you'd be out of a job
rom why haven't you got a slave of your own don't you need one help with your business
probably do sloggio but well i mean i've bought plenty of slaves in my time oh yes slaves from all over the roman empire you can pick up bargains in the forum but you get them home and they are not what they're cracked up to be it's not as if i don't know how to look after a slave i'm very fair
you need to feed them for a start oh please i think i shall be calling you slobbio from now on which part of the roman empire are you from i'm from britain
we were here long before you romans arrived i was captured and sold to a roman senator but my master is fair and there are worse jobs than being a slave yeah
are there like what like having to carry heavy sacks all the way to chester oh please
why have we stopped
to see some more of roman saint albans it don't look very roman here it looks modern on the outside but inside it's full of roman treasures if we dug deep there'd be lots more evidence of roman buildings here
i don't have to dig now do i no that's what archaeologists do
and because roman cities were always designed in a similar way there's bound to be more here than we can see could be right beneath our feet
why are roman towns alike
what buildings did they have
were roman cities all the same size
roman towns were different sizes but followed a similar pattern they had a grid system of roads and alleyways there was a forum a marketplace a basilica for the town council a religious building for praying to gods and goddesses they also had houses shops and workshops some even had an amphitheatre for entertainment an aqueduct to supply water and a public bath house we know a lot about roman cities because of pompeii in italy it's one of the most complete roman towns we can still see for centuries pompeii was buried because a nearby volcano called vesuvius erupted in seventy nine ad it left a cloud of black ash all over the landscape but when the town was finally uncovered parts of the original buildings from roman times were still there
where are we now are we nearly at chester no
but we are still on watling street
it's a lot quieter here than it was in saint albans yes
it didn't used to be though look we're walking alongside the forum of the roman city of wroxeter
it looks like stones in the grass
yeah it does now but they were once huge roman columns over there that was the bath house
where i can only see ruins
but imagine what it was like in our time
why did the romans build wroxeter
why isn't wroxeter a city in the twenty first century
this arch formed part of the gateway to the bath house wroxeter it was a marvellous city
i don't know why you built it there's not much life around here
but there was in roman times sloggio it was great it was on watling street it was next to the river severn and over there was wales we romans had to protect this part of britain from the welsh invaders
but why isn't it important today when we left nobody else moved in
the anglo saxons who followed us built their own city six miles away it's called shrewsbury does that still exist today oh yeah
i was thinking we could get rid of this stuff there ah
well think again come on sloggio time to go but but i've got more questions
like what
like what happened to the rest of the city why can modern people only see part of it well why don't people dig them up
because archaeologists can't just go digging anywhere can they there might be other historic buildings on top of the roman ones like at canterbury the roman city of durovernum
what happened there maybe your gadget could tell us
sloggio are you really interested in canterbury or are you just looking for a longer rest rom
i am really interested huh
underneath here is the roman town of durovernum now known as canterbury archaeologists have been collecting clues about the city's past just two metres below this ground is an entire roman town archaeologists know because they have found fragments of buildings that compare with fragments from roman towns elsewhere in britain we found the major buildings we'd expect to find in a roman town we found evidence for the theatre which now is situated underneath a restaurant we found evidence for the roman public baths these baths were situated underneath a modern bookshop we have found evidence for a roman marketplace now called the marlowe shopping arcade we'd really like to find more evidence for the temple we've only found a tiny bit of the temple we found some of the marble that made it up but we don't know exactly where the temple was situated archaeologists can't just go and dig wherever they like a lot of the buildings around canterbury are very important and very old and very beautiful we wait for an existing building to be knocked down we do our work then the new building goes up sometimes we find remains that are too big to take out of the ground for example in the high street are three very big roman mosaics which are still beneath the ground they have been incorporated into a museum canterbury isn't as well known as some of the other big roman towns but we are as archaeologists doing what we can to bring attention to the roman remains
rom where are we now still on watling street i don't suppose we're near chester yet are we
in fact we're in chester the roman city of deva we are oh yes oh thank goodness
don't look much like it did in our day does it
it's changed over the years but let's find the bits that haven't there's the river dee for example or the roman walls around the city
can't i just dump it now we're here
sloggio this is the twenty first century they have rules about that sort of thing you can't just go dumping your old rubbish anywhere ha so what you admit it's a sack of old rubbish then eh no it's ha yeah come on
why have roman objects lasted so long
why did roman cities have walls
i knew you'd make me walk the wall
yeah well you've got to when you're in chester and it is roman
is it all roman
it follows the same route as ours and you can still see some of the roman stonework but bits have been added and rebuilt since we were here two thousand years ago
i don't know why you built it to start with i do keep out slaves
only joking sloggio no city walls they were there to protect us from our enemies and they were built to last
oh that's better i haven't had a sit down for hours
ssh ugh
where are we now
at chester amphitheatre i don't think much of the entertainment nor do i
it's like watching traffic
but imagine what it was like in roman times sloggio come over here look at all these roman objects these have all been found in chester you see because we romans made things so well and used hard objects like stone and clay well there are lots of genuine articles still to be found all over britain
if they've already got roman articles why do they need more
sloggio what have you done
now it really is rubbish eh where are we now rom back on watling street oh good it's a much easier walk without that junk to carry for the last time sloggio that was not junk
i cannot believe you lost that quality roman merchandise i mean who knows where it is now we've had a totally wasted journey no we haven't oh yes
we've seen signs of the romans in chester and wroxeter and saint albans and along watling street and now we're going to see them all again on the way back
and we will aim to help you find the house of your dreams by casting our metaphorical property nets far and wide
come hell or high water we'll prove that the property world can be your oyster land ahoy and today we are on course for the english riviera and beautiful brixham
our buyers want to know what life's like when salty sea water hits your face what it's like to be pestered by seagulls they want to know what it's like to live along the coast
whether it's a beach hut or a fisherman's cottage they can be sure of one thing
they'll be able to try before they buy
so meet our beach combers chris and barbara weaving they want to swap their sutton coldfield home for a life by the sea
they've been bitten by the travel bug they want a seaside base that gives them and their motor home easy access to foreign shores
now barbara is a keen watercolour artist so inspirational landscapes and nice light are a must
and chris is a train buff and loves nothing better than tinkering with his train set in the garden shed so this seems like the simplest programme we have ever had to do you're here we're in brixham we're stood next to a mobile home isn't that the job done we move this wherever you want to go
no it's a little bit draughty for the winter so we want bricks and mortar we want to travel round in that in the summer so you know we are looking for something that has got a bit of room on the side that we can put the motor home and a nice comfortable little house somewhere
i am from this area so i love it but why have you decided that this is the place that you want to end up in
we visit down here quite often
well yes we visit down here lots two or three times a year generally i've got brothers living in the area we like the sea in general so just to be by the seaside after living in the midlands for all our lives really it'll just make a nice change
what will you do down here though is it all just about relaxing
well i paint so it will be marvellous for me to go somewhere a bit different i've done the countryside views i'd like to do some seascapes and things like that now chris does model engineering so he is making three b. one engines
i'm currently with a colleague making three seven and a quarter inch gauge locomotives we have been working on them for five years and we have another three or four years left
he's usually down the shed
there's another thing we need either a shed or a reasonable workshop or we'll have to take over half a garage if there is a garage at the property that we manage to find
i know if he is down the shed he's working he's not sitting there with a newspaper
a lot of men in sheds aren't always working
we'll find this house for you what is the budget how much will we spend
yes i think so yes we really wanted to make that max
o. k. that sounds fair we want money to spend abroad in italy and france
we want to spend the kids' inheritance abroad
good i like a couple of inheritance blowers
we'll waste no time have a cream tea and we will see you later on
we've got a couple of inheritance blowers on our hand it's the old ones you've got to watch out for
what i like about them are the houses that we've got to find it's got to have space so they can build steam engines and yet views where you can paint landscapes do you think i'd be good rendered in watercolour
i'd say gouache gouache oh really not goulash gouache gouache yes if i covered you in goulash that would look lovely
and brixham offers every seaside attraction imaginable from beautiful beaches to a bustling harbour picturesque fishermen's cottages and of course plenty of fish and chips
but what would a budget of two hundred forty thousand buy you around the rest of the country
overwhelmingly the best property you have every shown anyone
if brixham was a fish what kind of fish would brixham be
in what way brixham plaice
brixham plaice really great here's your bus i was thinking something olde worlde what fish do you think sums up brixham
that has space for a winnebago
flat fish why a flat fish it's boring and there's nothing here
the inner harbour area wasn't really designed for the automobile no
has it become a different fish over the years yeah was it ever a killer whale yes at one time
the victorians didn't have many winnebagos at all not on the whole they were so short sighted what were they thinking
sole really why
because it is quite a soulful place
very nice i see what you have done there soulful place i know ha ha
the drive is massive i challenge you to find a winnebago that won't go on that
you're throwing down the gauntlet aren't you now in brixham it's very easy to catch fish however trawling for properties well that's not quite so easy but i think looking at our catch here we've done all right
we've cast our net look at the property details we've got and we only need to find three
oh boy yes indeed i am quite pleased with my property it is larger than required four bedrooms edward
they only wanted three don't be cocky
four bedrooms anything else you've given them extra well the views are nice it's got the period detail and the price is good what more can i say
and parking for the motor home yes actually yes what about you you've slightly put me in the shade there i think mine's nice it's a different house different style a little bit more modern does have a slight problem let's not mention it now
is this your property bait is this the best you can do it's great
fantastic views lovely view of a church outside it's got a great garden nice bit of decking out there it's lovely and i think it is easily move in able
move in able that technical term i'm trying that phrase out then for the wild card our joint choice i found this
i found this the same place great minds think alike
yeah he lost the poetry just there so there we have it we've got our three properties
let's commence the viewings
and property one is my choice set up high on the north west of brixham is this splendid traditional victorian town house which i think may well put the wind in our buyers' mainsail now barbara and chris ignore the cat in the tree here we are at my choice now this is a very exciting house and i want you to be excited
i am you feeling it yes we're feeling it
well it sounds interesting it looks interesting it does
yeah you like yeah we do like
obviously you've got the parking for the mobile home sorted out so where's that going to go
um you're all looking at me aren't you yeah i'm that's work in progress and i'm working on that one and i'll be back with an answer as soon as i can
we could discuss it now i think let's discuss the house yeah not got time for that now no moving on all right he doesn't want to release the information go in there act like children in there think of it as your own place and enjoy it
where are you going to park it
right now as i said that's work in progress and i was thinking
you're going to run away because you don't know where it'll go he's got no idea
boy oh boy christian let's see just see what you did if they are going to like the house i'm sure they will
i like the fireplace yeah it's a nice fireplace
we could light a nice real fire in that's good yeah
the fire in there is ready i was thinking about lighting it should i light the fire i'll leave it
i'll stand outside with headphones on
yeah and if i'm going to be cold they can be cold
he did point out a radiator though that smacks to me of not being that interested
yeah but then as he's an engineer who likes building thing maybe a radiator is the epicentre of excitement for him
it contains hot water hot water makes steam steam engines steam powers a train he's excited about radiators naturally
i'm not too sure about this wallpaper
so make that into an arch take it through yeah rsj in there
has he said rsj he's talking about opening up the two reception rooms
personally that makes me nervous i kind of like it the way it is if they want more light in there it's all about decor and lighting
right and the kitchen the kitchen
i like it when you go into the kitchen in the seaside theme it's a galley kitchen
i'm not too keen on all these fishing things hanging down
it's nice when you're in a seaside town to have your plastic fish stuck on the wall
it's big enough to modernise it isn't it it's not titchy it's a reasonable size it's bigger than the kitchen we have
i think it's big enough to cook a meal for eight or ten people in and do buffets like we do for all twenty seven of them when they all come together right
you've found the measure of them i understand them they like entertaining they love a kitchen to me the kitchen will get them
this place is all about lifestyle you could walk down to the fish market where the trawlers come in unload there into the market buy your fresh brixham sole bring it up here cook it in there with your plastic lobsters on the ceiling and voila marvellous
this looks like it's the bathroom it's actually quite old fashioned but isn't a bad size
it's a smashing size yes
now this bathroom it's huge it's huge
no but i think you've got room to put a shower in haven't you yes
if he can put up an rsj in the lounge he can put a shower up in the bathroom
but it's not a bad sized room no this is nice yeah
yeah this is a nice sized room cosy
part of the same character window that we have got downstairs
it's a strange shape this room you look at the bed it's all skew whiff isn't it
it's this wall here isn't it when you look at the border wall and the garden it goes off at an angle
but that's because it's an old house it's not a new build where it's boring and bland and square this has got charm now we know that that's what they don't want well i'm not sure about that
you can either have an uninterrupted sea view but here i like the way it's framed behind the rooftops and the chimney
the artist lowry would really be able to do something with that
i think that these rooms up here will probably only be used when we were inundated yes i know but i dare say the boys have got some ideas
from the outside i got the impression that was what i was going to find
yeah so no big surprises no but it doesn't have to be like this when you come in here they've got this william morris wallpaper here which is lovely but in this space i think it just is quite dark en masse
it's a bit fussy isn't it
and you've got some very simple decorative features strip the wallpaper off paint it white you could see them better kind of like what's happened in here yeah now this is much a simpler style and i'm thinking it might be more your taste
it is i like these plain walls they're not very big rooms downstairs so it is rather clever that they've kept all the walls nice and light and plain
and is this your taste and your style yes it would be yeah
yeah i think this works in here
you might want to make it feel bigger by painting the skirting boards to push the space out a bit the carpet a lot of people in devon have this rusty coloured carpet only because the soil down here is so red when you walk it in the house it ruins the carpets so they keep these earthy colours to hide the stains
i didn't know that we learn something new every day
bring in all the stuff
the rolling stock it's so long you could build a massive shed and work on real trains here it's a nice idea it is here is the other problem parking of your mobile home
yes i think this has got the potential here
do me a favour pace it go on one two three how many foot is your mobile home chris
seven eight there we are there twenty four foot i reckon that's twenty four foot and that's what it is
perfection so all the other houses down here they've knocked a bit out you could put your mobile home in easily a mobile extension we've got plenty of room in which to reverse
a bit of adjustment but nothing too difficult
as if christian designed it for you it comes at a price though and it's time to guess the price chris come with me ah mr. pickwick ah monsieurs right you get in here get in next to barbara
oh you're all swapping round here look at this
guess the price time this is really important
you're pitted against each other chris i'm rooting for you
barbara i'm rooting for you then
well we've just been doing man stuff out here you've seen the house you've seen the outskirts of it everything what's it worth come on chris me first do you think it's going to help you ladies first you can work with her guess and make yours better go on barbara
chris that's amazing you got it wrong that's great barbara meanwhile spot on spot on you see
did he tell you it was a fix he told you
no i think it was a fix no it's not an inside job bad loser bad loser
we're off to property number two my property remember this and let's go and see property number two now move over christian for house number two i'm confident that my choice this detached property in the desirable southwest part of brixham has all the answers barbara and chris property number two my choice she's called highlands because she's on the highlands of brixham you've got a lovely view out there over a fantastic looking church you could see that every morning
nice hill good any more pluses
you can see into the distance which is good not surrounded and totally enclosed by houses it's good
we're rocking on yeah
get in there speak your mind tell us what you think of the size i'm speaking the truth no you are yours was bigger stay friends have that one mine's flatter and has a big drive
right ed headphones on again and see what they make of this lovely house just just stop there
it's like a telephone room meets office space meets somewhere to hang your coat
i expected this was going to be a downstairs loo
that's what i thought it was going to be when i saw the window outside but yes it's very nice
you could turn that into a little mini library when you walk in a little vestibule of books
they want to make it a toilet not a library they were convinced it was a toilet and can't accept that it could be anything else
what do you think of that barbara
hey that's not bad it's a decent sized room isn't it
yes it's what we talked about lounge cum dining room
what's round there well it goes bigger all together oh it goes bigger round there
so yes it could be rearranged couldn't it so furniture further apart room for a dining room
after you then barbara just go into the kitchen and have a look
right
well it's small and compact it's small and compact
how much room do we need
it's not much different to the kitchen we've got at the moment size wise
so we've got the cooker and the hob and
any dishwashers or anything like that
i don't know whether any are a fridge or not or
no where's the fridge
ah this is where some of the white goods are
white goods he's mentioned white goods i love my white goods
so a small conservatory that is a tumble dryer isn't it
washing machine fridge freezer a lean to it's more of a utility than a conservatory it is isn't it
now if i owned that lean to or conservatory i would take down the net what is the point of having a glass conservatory and then concealing the outside view with nets
oh crikey looks good corner bath corner bath that's a good sized corner bath it is oh it's a jacuzzi thing it is it's got the jets
i think barry white i think corner bath i think add bubbles and you're there
oh it's a nice big bedroom isn't it
i like this room this is nice yeah it is lovely view look at the view over there chris
that's a watercolour starting to form in my head and i can see it ed it's the early morning scene pass me my watercolours it's happening
nice to see the change of the seasons i like to see that
they like the majority of the decor there's only the odd hiccup
can i tell you why why neutral palates christian neutral let's do it again
so
ah what's that
it isn't a steam engine no oh thank god for that
it's a little watchmaker's lathe
a little watchmaker's lathe i wouldn't recognise a watchmaker's lathe if it hit me round the head
it looks like somebody's making dolls houses aren't they
yes they might well be yeah they are he's making a dolls house other people have other hobbies you know we are not the only ones
christian do you think they have spotted it doesn't have a third bedroom
oh yes i think so
i think it's time for me to solve this dilemma with a very clever plan
it's like working with sherlock holmes for all my cheap mockery you actually quite like the house don't you we quite like this it's a good house it is a very good house
we feel some good vibes about it
for you the excitement is this way so if we just weave our way down here now garden shed yeah it kind of looks every dayish kind of dull and then we open up inside and you are going to love this come on inside
it's brilliant it's almost ready for me to move into
i can almost feel your aura in here already i feel at home you have got lathes grinders you have got power come on make yourself at home it's good pop yourself down there indeed let's just see if this works for you
goodness me i'll leave you in here and you come up with something
and we'll guess the price in ten minutes have a nice time it's good
it's something i've always wanted to do good
he loves it i'm sure he loves it
it looks very interesting
barbara you have spotted have you not the flaw in this house
it's only two bedrooms there is a solution and i was going to tell you
but you told it me as i was about to tell it you so go on
to take the end off this room and make that into a small bedroom
great now that's a really good idea also you have got the motor home outside you could power that up and store people in there as well
yeah store people course you could i could store people in there
so i am going to give you the thumb tell me when to stop and this is your thoughts on the whole house now we know about the bedrooms and storing people in the motor home
oops keep your
her thumbs have gone up yeah oh really fair enough
meanwhile sir has been making all kind of things in the shed
has he i certainly have wood carving everything oh that was quick
meanwhile the second guess the price time chris you've got to sort this out because i want barbara to win but she is doing well go on give us your best price
that's five thousand over your maximum
i know but it just feels it might be that because of the situation with the extra room around it
you're only doing that cos you saw chisels downstairs i know what's going on barbara yeah what are you going to say
that's really good
a pilot is generally a person who operates one of the smaller boats to bring the larger ships into the harbour
he's like a parking attendant for the big ships
yes i know he's a marine genius
so basically it's a one hundred years old it's got loads of charm and character but of course it's not really all about this it's about this yeah fabulous view that is waiting to be rendered in water colour isn't it
definitely one thing you need to know the house we are about to see is a blank canvas
the developer is still developing so enjoy and it could be yours to put your own imprint on
you should love a blank canvas i should tell us what you think it's probably the blankest canvas i have ever seen
it is blank but does it have a bathroom
just about they like bathrooms we know that come on meanwhile we popped next door to eavesdrop in the comfort of the fully refurbished one bedroom house
right oh
salty sea water the smell of fish will they be able to resist its sea watery charms
good cod i've haddock with this plaice
we did pre empt the fact that it might be a building site
i said blank canvas i should have said building site yeah
do you think this is going to be a kitchen
probably a kitchen yes it's got the plumbing it's got the plumbing there which could be fitted up quite nice it's only a small kitchen but it's six foot by ten foot yes
oh he's doing his measuring virtual measuring
chris told me this tip and i don't know if you know this tip you're a high as your arms
you are as long as your arms
fingertip to fingertip is your height
and he measures everything like this which is a bit weird but that is what he is doing lounge
after you
so you know that if you wanted to lie down you couldn't in this cavity
now chris knows that a wide pace is about a foot for him and he'll be walking everywhere like that measuring constantly
so one pace is a foot
i'm going a foot
you need to work these things out you just go at them too quickly you need to pace it out and think about doors he'll be all right
we could watch our seal
our little seal our very own seal
the doors must open inside then you can get some nice fresh air in
you could open that and you smell the sea that's it ah lovely lovely
yes plenty of room for your pictures yeah i know
and you could even sit here painting couldn't you in actual fact
yes so you might get fed up of painting the same view all of the time
i know we intend travelling around in different places and looking
half the things out there are flying that's a moving living breathing entity
another nice view out into the bay it's lovely would you say this is a double bedroom
it's a bit narrow that way isn't it
yes i think we could probably have two bunk beds along here two double bunk beds
and one down there
and one there we can sleep them all when they arrive there is another factor there is no garden here to keep up
true true
there is no garden here but you have got fantastic balconies you could have a little flower box demonstration given pop that in down there and if you want to go and weed the unwanted plants of the water you can go in that seaweed
you can have the ocean garden as your garden
they did say that we could put our own input into it if we were interested in taking it further
we have thrown them a curve ball and it's not what they expected but with a little compromise why not live in a house like this it's not what they asked for but it's a very interesting proposition
this is a bit wider you could put a bed that way can't you you could yes
i think they seem very enthusiastic about this seriously
i was slightly concerned cos i didn't know if it would be to their taste but it's this view i think that's wangled it
that's a bit bigger than what i expected it to be i thought it was only going to be this wide
yes i did too it cuts back into optical illusion
either one single bed or bunk beds
bunk beds for the grandchildren so yes it's interesting it's interesting
well romeo it's time we left this balcony and showed those two what life could really be like here
chris come with me so we have one two three bedrooms potential look up fourth get up there and have a look it's a very big space up there right let's go up now this could be an artist's studio up there for barbara could be simply storage tell me what you think
i'm surprised it's bigger than i expected so yes it's interesting it is
come back down so extra space up there extra space up there there is there is one other problem with this place it's always the motor home and cars
it is the parking and the shed situation
and the shed situation barbara does like her garden so there are a few issues car parking can be sorted for four hundred a year you can park your car in any of brixham's public car parks four hundred for a permit very reasonable for the motor home you've done this before put an advert out and see if anyone wants to rent you space
that's potential
i want to show you this property which is next door to the one you've just seen it has been done by the same developer now this is only a one bedroom property but it gives you an idea of the finished spec oh it's lovely when you walk round this property you can see the bathroom is in it's got the fireplace in the lounge so all the features and of course fitted kitchen so it brings it all alive for you
it was hard to tell in the other one it is when you are looking at such a blank canvas bare walls
all i'm going to say to you is if you were ready and that property was right for you get in early this is the prime moment to dive on in there cos you could talk to the developer here's our deposit we don't really like these white gloss units or we really don't like that fireplace downstairs we prefer this this this and this and if you want to go high spec and put in a really posh kitchen maybe there is a halfway house where you go here's some extra money but we want the full works and can you put it in a lot of money has been spent to bring it up to this status we need to talk about money i need an edward and a chris i can hear them coming up the stairs very well timed come on in next to barbara it is the third and final guess the price time you're losing
and i'm losing he is losing have you got one right yet i don't think you have no i have tended to go too high
this is the glory shot so it is still my shot again would it help you if you guessed first or second do you think
you've let me down massively but i don't want to talk about it here's the real punch in the gut spot on
and to help you with that we have the magical laptop here who shall i entrust this to you can leave that with me on there are images details everything you need to know about the properties go away with it not too far cos we need that back look at them and make the big decision of which one you want to test drive
we'll do that thanks very much head that way see you later
see you soon and while they are fishing for that rather important decision
here's a quick reminder for you at home
downsizing a little our next property on the south side of town only has two bedrooms however the ample parking and pleasant views are a real bonus making the price tag of two hundred twenty nine thousand nine hundred fifty very attractive
we remember the front of this one don't we
that was really pretty i liked that fireplace
you did i wasn't keen not a bad sized kitchen it was all right
bathroom was good that was not a bad size and it was good area the windows at the front were nice good bedrooms good bedrooms on it yes indeed right so this house then oh this one this is the second house that's nice
nice frontage plenty of parking there was yeah nice big sitting room and dining area kitchen was
kitchen was a bit small but adequate a bit small but adequate i would agree with that
the bathroom was nice yes it was a nice bathroom
bedroom second bedroom was a nice size and a nice view across to saint mary's church this was interesting yes it was the pilot's cottage a work in progress yes lovely views looking outside and over brixham harbour the comings and to ings and fro ings of the boats and the yachts well i think then we have now both decided which one we would like to test drive what do you think
yeah well hold that thought
don't say another word because in a minute we are going to let you do your test drive where we give you the house to treat as your own before you do that we have had our to buy or not to buy surveyor give this house a going over now basically the house got a very good clean bill of health he did say that the garden is terraced and round the patio area there is no railings you might want to think about that for when the grandkids visit you know a bit of health and safety but apart from that you're laughing great
so we have a guide here we have a choice of the model village the steam railway or i used to be a tour guide in a cave system here called kent's cavern
why don't we go at triple speed and do all three
it's a plan you know what you're doing we'll see you later
a tense moment will the motor home fit yes perfectly
and while barbara has a look around will the shed measure up to chris's demanding standards
there is nothing more relaxing than a spot of sketching don't you think
can i come in
well i'm sorry but it's a men's place only this is the shed this is my shed
that's not fair
i have to say while you have been doing your test drive we have been having a fabulous time
i feel slightly sick at the candyfloss and rock i've eaten steam trains are you jealous
i am indeed stalagmites and stalactites
which one's which i like stalagmites stalagmites they are the ones that go up stalactites we have learnt something
but enough of us it's more about you now because this house is it still feeling nice is it still feeling lovely and homely
yes we like the feel of this house we do indeed yeah
it's got a nice cosy atmosphere
it has indeed we like the idea of the upstairs bedroom and alteration potential to it
good and you look at home yeah we were walking round
planning and thinking how we could alter things and i think that's a good sign when you do that
well i think we are going to need some extra time to think about it
it's certainly grown on me and i think it ticks so many boxes that i think it's really in the running
and so it's a definitely maybe isn't it it's a definite ma ybe
it's a definite maybe oh i think we have done well
we have we should leave now whilst we are still ahead because there are still other places for us to go and visit
absolutely we'll see you later on ed i think we can actually be quite pleased with ourselves
of course we can we have done a hard day's work we have done well
now how about you and i rewarding ourselves for all our hard work
another chance well we have been to the steam museum we have been to the zoo and we have been caving and that was all great fun
left to do in torbay i can recommend oh there's the butterfly farm the otter sanctuary
christian you have hit the magic word you don't need any more
hang on water park otter sanctuary please it's all happening meanwhile little does he know we are actually going house hunting once again for somebody that might need our help and if that person is you
don't hesitate to get in touch but we're off to an otter sanctuary now come on that's right otherwise known as the estate agents christian do you think they are going to like this house
possibly i didn't get my legs over ed
shall we answer that
it's probably green and amp co
go on go on go on answer it
i've got a question for you what do some old gas pipes a ping pong bat a shopping trolley and a kitchen sink have in common they can all be made to make music what a racket i've in plymouth home to weapons of sound a really exciting teenage band but what makes them different is that all their instruments are made out of rubbish weapons of sound have been going for a couple of years now and they're doing really well playing at festivals around britain and at the royal albert hall home to some of the world's finest orchestras i bet that was the first time the albert hall saw home made instruments like these
television radio i'd miss my dishwasher
this village in peru doesn't have electricity wood fires for cooking and light from candles is not an easy life no dishwashers or fridges when you only have candle power everybody goes to bed early because it's dark just reading and writing can be difficult in gloomy classrooms but near by there is a village that has a power station this produces electricity which is delivered to the village
the most positive thing it has brought is electric light with electricity we can have activities at night sometimes all the locals get together in the park when there is a birthday or a national day
lundy island it's the just off the devon coast some houses can't be connected to the mains electricity supply so this house has gas lamps candles and heat from the fire but there is some electricity for the village there is a generator which runs on oil generating electricity for the people on the island but oil is expensive so to save this fuel it gets switched off every night at midnight
this is a modern house in rural zambia i haven't got electricity i use paraffin for my lights i use candles and i use batteries car batteries to power my record player and i have this stereo i use small batteries to operate my radio cassette
it is perfectly possible to manage without electricity but zambia is a country with plenty of sunshine out in remote countryside fitting special panels that can make electricity from sunlight is a good way of having electricity these panels are solar panels and mean you can have electricity all the time the sun is shining
the adventures of electro mouse our hero saves the day again
this is the story of a little bear that couldn't sleep
he was frightened of the dark
i don't know about that let's see shall we
it was a beautiful day where the bears lived the sun was shining snow was everywhere the two bears were playing
little bear couldn't sleep he was playing around little bear tried lying on his back then he tried upside down then with his head over the edge of the bed i'm frightened of the dark really frightened said little bear why are you frightened said big bear because it is dark said little bear where asked big bear there said little bear outside big bear thought about how he could shut out the dark
big bear thought about it for a long time then he said come on little bear where are we going asked little bear out said big bear out into the darkness said little bear yes but i'm scared of the dark no need to be said big bear and he took little bear by the paws and lead him out from the cave into the night it was dark ooh i'm scared said little bear cuddling up to big bear big bear lifted little bear and cuddled him and said look at the dark little bear and little bear looked i've brought you the moon little bear said big bear the bright yellow moon and all the twinkly stars
in the dark he saw the big yellow moon
but little bear didn't say anything for he'd gone to sleep warm and safe in big bear's arms big bear carried little bear back into the bear cave fast asleep and he settled down with little bear on one arm and the bear book on the other cosy in the chair by the fire and big bear read the bear book right to the end are you like little bear
no
so when you go to bed you go straight to sleep
good i think there is no quick fix to the current situation anyone who thinks we can certainly make one or two moves to transform our political misfortunes fortunes is misleading themselves what we thing to do is to solidly govern i think the programme that gordon set out yesterday regarding housing plus our radical commitment to allow people to request the right to training these are big steps forward we need to set ourselves up for a long haul towards the next general election l. think that as we move forward the contrast between gordon brown has a solid dependable serious politician against what i think people and i got this on the doorstep yesterday in crewe even though there are concerns about us the p. r. d. victory of david cameron
the p. r. gimmickry of david cameron but that bore no relation at all to the question i asked you let me ask you another one after the local elections which were dire for your party gordon brown toured the t. v. and radio studios in a charm offensive and within five days the opinion polls had slumped even worse even worse to the worst since records began so what makes you think that this time it will get better
i think gordon is the best leader that we can put forward
why don't the people
is what people have rumbled he would not tell us the truth about why he didn't call the election it was clearly because the polls suggested he would not win it but he would never tell us that the reason why almost three billion is being pumped into the economy now is not because the situation has deteriorated since the budget it's exactly the same it's because he had to spend three billion to repair the ten p. nonsense this morning he wouldn't admit that either he is saying this is a kind of pump priming exercise why didn't he do it in the budget he is not honest with us
a i think he is straight with people and that will become clearer as time goes on i think first off he acknowledged clearly that the ten p. decision was a mistake as quickly as possible he has brought forward changes to put a situation right what is most frustrating about this situation this labour government has done more than any previous government to boost the incomes of poor working people that's why ten p. man was a mistake we are putting that right and into the bargain we are not just supporting those people who were affected but it is a wider tax cut
why didn't he do that in the budget
he has
we'll come back to carry on our theme of monthly press conferences as the prime minister is answering questions it is time for our daily quiz the question for today is all about that monthly press conference the question is this a tricky question this to enter go to our website please send us your comments about any of today's stories
it is only tricky if you are bothered jo is like that you know she does get bothered about these things now then i think we're going to turn to crime now because let me just get my script here the home secretary jack smith has just announced this morning that for the first time crimes involving those under sixteen will be recorded a lot of you may not know that in the british crime survey until now crimes committed by under sixteens are not recorded and yet youth crime now regularly dominates the headlines you have seen them in all major cities across the land there have been terrible stories such as last week when young jimmy mizen simply by going to a baker's shop became the thirteenth teenager murdered in the capital this year so far in other high profile cases there is a worrying new trend of what the tabloids are calling ladette culture there are reports of girls joining gangs and committing crimes the new figures on youth crime are out today
last week the home secretary failed to turn the tables on young troublemakers by ordering police officers to give them a taste of their own medicine and subject them to repeated visits new figures published today from the youth justice board reveal that it is not just young men who are behaving badly the number of offences committed by girls aged between ten and seventeen is up by twenty five per cent over a three year period the crimes recorded include public order offences and violence there were often carried out by girls who are drunk overall while most youth offences are carried out by boys the statistics for ten to seventeen year old boys show a slight reduction for the same period boris johnson is promising zero tolerance on youth crime we are now joined by councillor marianne alapani who campaigns on behalf of victims of such crimes those figures are quite dramatic in terms of girls getting involved in these crimes are you surprised
i am not surprised at all because i have been doing some sensitive case work on these very issues but i think it is difficult to answer this complex question without being judgmental i have been closely involved with kodjo yenga's family since he was tragically murdered
what role did gilles have to play in that crime
in this instance the bullying was instigated by the young girls who surrounded kodjo they were screaming kill him kill him ' girls the young boy who was killed had come here as an asylum seeker from the democratic republic of congo so the very country of sanctuary was where he was killed
look at the socio economic reasons emotional issues and the conditions under which they are living the evidence coming through from the caseworker i am doing seems to point out the fact that a lot of girls are facing what a lot of stress in terms of teenage pregnancy poverty as a result of that issues of estrangement with their families and the risk of being homeless substance misuse drugs and alcohol these are all major issues and these have been increasing and also there are initiation process is with the gangs and there is evidence of
there is a sensitive piece of casework regarding a thirteen year old girl with whom i dealt where she was asked to stab another young girl as a way of moving up from being a younger two going further up in the hierarchy she refused to stab the other girl and as a result she was invited to a party and went to the party and unfortunately she was the only person at the party apart from a group of young boys who assaulted her and branded her as well
that is a very shocking example of girls being initiated into gangs is there a sense that they are still the rare example and these figures are more about low level fighting between girls that is now being reported or is it that kind of violent crime which is really on the up
i think it's just something that we're so staggered about that it is noteworthy now however i am dealing with other instances where goals are part of the gang culture and it's something that we really need to stamp on to a large extent there is a sense of hopelessness and lack of options at the moment and so i think the proposals that were launched yesterday by gordon brown are very positive from the point of view of skills and education and what has been highlighted in terms of life and learning so that the young people have options in terms of apprenticeships that can give them a positive way forward
so you are seeing ways out through education what about boris johnson the new mayor of london and his proposals to tackle my crime what message would you like to send to him
there are three key messages it is important that we involve young people in identifying the solutions of how to overcome gun and knife related crime would very much like to be involved in a wide reaching and genuine consultation with young people that leads into a consultation to ask him people across london what would make them feel safe enough to stop carrying knives and guns
thanks we used day with us we will probably come back to you the minister bill rammell is with us this government promised to be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime but there is clearly an epidemic of the crime which people fear most which is violent crime what has gone wrong
some of the examples that have been quoted are shocking l. don't dispute that but if we look at the overall context
let's look at the youth justice board figures out today they show a two per cent reduction in the number of young people engaging in crime the figures for boys the major perpetrators have gone down quite a bit but the figures for girls have gone up significantly and i think any politician who says to you that they have a glib quick fix solution to that is either misleading themselves or misleading other people clearly alcohol has a role to play here
we are not expecting quick fixes you have been in power for eleven years
absolutely and if you look at the measures we have taken in respect of anti social behaviour orders
disposal orders they are having
real impact if you look at the measure that jackie smith has m. has outlined today that we are going to record crime for the under sixteens jacqui smith to get a much better understanding that will help us
is that overall the situation is improving but any young life that is taken
have you seen the scenes from manchester last night of glasgow rangers fans on the rampaged in downtown manchester on the rampage you really think
no i'm acknowledging that people have legitimate fears people are much less likely to be the victims of crime than in the past
thank you
what did you want the from the chancellor when you saw him today
london's infrastructure is dilapidated in parts
it is and one of the paradoxes is that as you in prove it for instance when we up grade the signalling that will bring the trains quicker through the stations quicker but you will need air conditioning because of the kinetic energy
what did you get from him where you didn't get such a generous reply
it was a pretty cordial relaxed perhaps guarded conversation
le was perhaps trying to get the measure of you
he didn't refuse any of my requests one thing i was emphatic about london's lead as the world financial centre and the credit crunch what we shouldn't did is overregulate now in response to that crisis and thereby produce the next crisis so i said whatever you do don't produce new taxes or e. u. regulations
when london was booming ken livingstone took the credit for it even though it was probably nothing to do with him if london starts to decline or goes into recession which the governor of the bank of england said is a porblgts you will probably get the blame possibility you will get the blame for it
mayor of london has that when it comes to the big issues of atmosphere in which companies work the ability to try and keep london number one you have very few tools in the box as mayor of london
there's two sides to it as mayor what you have to do is make the place safe and attractive therefore for top talent to come here and work here and you have got to make sure the infrastructure is working with our transport system is delivering people to work on time that is directly in my competence but you also have the other side is to be a champion and ambassador for london to speak up for london
it is more symbolic
you don't have the power to enforce a zero tolerance policy of the kind that was so successful under
and the rest of it there is
winnowing out job
sunday evenings churning out a column i remind them
time job
of course it is
so do you just need the money
and i think it serbltd that i should be able to essential that i should be able to convey to a wired audience my views on a wide range of subjects l. see no harm at all i think the daily telegraph is a better platform than a blog
really it depends on the plog enhenry says how long before the new style routemaster also be on the streets
henry you will see an announcement shortly about our plans to phase out the articulated buses we are going to commission a competition to launch a new generation routemaster
joining us from downing street is our old friend laura kuenssberg less of the old she's been listening to the prime minister gordon brown has done a round of interview this is morning after the publication of that draft legislative programme it's all been overshadowed by na gloomy outlook from the governor of the bank of england that still the
put against gordon brown is he used to do a disappearing act when things got difficult this time not a bit of it he's been barging into everyone's living rooms up and down the country by appearing on almost every television outlet that would have him he is putting himself out and about all over the place but still no sign of him going up to crewe for that important by election he is staying well away from that so far
that crucial by election is next week we'll be having a daily politics special next friday on the crewe by election the aftermath you have been the crewe why didn't they use the prime minister's picture on the labour propaganda
i don't know about that but in terms of gordon brown going to the by election i think i'm right in saying that tony blair as prime minister didn't visit the by election
because if you visit one you have to visit them all even when you have no chance of winning
in terms of the general political situation andrew at the moment we are in the middle of a third term labour government in the midst of an international credit squeeze people are reacting against the government our task is to shift from that to look at the contrast between this government and an alternative conservative one then i think we are much better placed
we shall see
the viewer placed also decide when did these placed prime also decide when did these prime ministerial press conferences take
place think it was june two thousand two i i think we are agreed on it well done l. had no idea thanks to all our guest and a specific thanks to you bill rammell who came in at the last minutes l. will be back tonight on b. b. c. one for this week where we'll have a star studded cast to make jonathan ross jealous

how much would you pay for that in an auction i would say ninety one hundred goodness me seriously it is a bargain
but we try and get something more off absolutely we always do the conversation is over
if you can get it any less than that are you up for it we certainly are go on then
the bling was bagged for a bargain forty five
come on anita hurry up
you girls are running rings around me slow down slow down
what d'you think of this
eileen this is a bottle fit for all the perfumes of arabia
i like it i think it's gorgeous
what we've got here is a double scent bottle so we can have two types of perfume this one here is just a little clip lid and you can open it like that we are missing a stopper there it's a pity but it is not going to make a huge difference and on the other side this is a screw top it is a double bottle we would have another type of perfume or eau de cologne in there the bottle dates from about the mid eighteen hundreds
that's older than i thought
it's an older item
what you think of it june i think it's really sweet and i think it's attractive
initially i was put off because i don't like cranberry but it grows on you
the colour of the glass will help with the price i'm sure you are right eileen you just fell in love with it absolutely are you a girl who likes wearing perfume very much so
i just love splashing it all over i like to rock the room like the french perfume that rocks the room
in auction there will be people who collect scent bottles people who collect cranberry and people who collect small silver objects we've got a three pronged attack here so a price eileen
they are asking seventy two which is about the run of the mill price now we need to get it down i think so
it's up to you eileen do you think you can do it
yes i like it i want it
eileen definitely rocked the room buying a scent bottle for sixty five fancy a chat with some other bargain hunt surfers then log on to our website and look out for our message board you never know what you'll find on it right guv'nor
deborah david what do you think of this
nice pretty thing isn't it
i think it's beautiful what do you think that is
a piece of bohemian glass absolutely right let's check it out
it's got to be heavy first of all which it is brilliant cut bright colours what do you know about bohemian glass i do n't
bohemian glass is collected again because of its quality but it's got to be in mint condition remember that
i had noticed that there is a tiny tiny little chip on the top on the gilding well um
it's gonna have an effect but not a massive one it wouldn't have as big an effect for example if it was in the glass that could be gilded for thirty or forty quid and no one would ever know how old is it do you feel i really don't know i think looking at the colours and the gilding one might describe that as early twentieth century they do sell for big money they can do particularly in pairs as you've said price wise for this one the ticket price says one hundred seventy five anyone who hasn't got a one thousand budget and wants something extremely nice extremely pretty and good value for money i think it would be a winner
i think it's lovely i really do i didn't notice the nibble until you picked it out but i think the gilding on it the colour and the weight i think it's lovely what do you think it'll make at auction i think it will be over the two hundred and under the three hundred
you two are going to make a fortune the way you're speaking
the bohemian vase was bought for a whopping one hundred fifty
what have you got aw that's gorgeous you know julia i can see you with a little black dress wearing this crescent brooch on the lapel oh i'd love it every girl should have a little black dress exactly it's a quality item i knew i had a couple of classy birds here let's have a look at the back the back of it tells us a lot now it's fifteen carat gold and the pin is beautifully shaped to follow that crescent isn't that lovely if we turn it back round all the pearls are there and they look like the original pearls little motif up here zigzag i think this brooch has everything going for it
that's super
tell me why you like it
it's so elegant and so stylish i know if i was wearing it i would feel so good in it
like a million dollars absolutely eileen what about you it's growing on me but it wasn't the first thing i'd have chosen for myself
but i like the daintiness of it and the pearls the whole design is pretty good how much is the brooch
i'm afraid i always go for expensive items it is one hundred fifteen
one hundred fifteen what do you you think i think it's certainly worth one hundred fifteen because we've got everything there we've got quality condition but we really want to get it down for the purposes of selling in auction we like it and let's hope there are other classy birds at the auction
the classy birds bargained the brooch down to one hundred
what do you think of this then
what is it it's a beaver muff oh dear june i think it's absolutely dreadful
do you know how many people have had their hands in that and you've got your hands in it
i really like it
what do you think of this eileen that's quite pretty we're running out of time where is anita our third item
i can't keep up with you what have you got
what do you think blue and white is always popular
and you'll always get folk who collect that type of ware nice flower decoration good condition the glaze is very fresh we have all these positive aspects if we look at the back it's losol ware which was one of the staffordshire factories jacobean pattern made perhaps end of the nineteenth early twentieth century
what's that do you see
something's written on here eric's uncle bob's dish what does that mean
it shows that it's got a great provenance
good talking point
i hope uncle bob doesn't want it back cos we want it
so a nice plate a good make how much
it's thirty five thirty five yes yes
it's a wee bit dear at that i think you'd have to get it down to make some sort of profit on it shall we go for it oh definitely let's go and see eric's uncle bob
unfortunately eric's uncle bob wasn't available but the stallholder let them have it for thirty
deborah you picked out these two big beauties why do you like them i love them
i think they've got character charisma i could see them sitting in a big fireplace i think they're fantastic
what are they made out of they're made of brass and copper
brass and copper springs to mind benson
good name well spotted benson known for his art nouveau lamps very flamboyant very organic all those right words that you use with art no l. v. e. a l. any signs of a benson stamp not that i can find
but they are in the style you love them
but what on earth are they used for
i think there are two uses either dog irons with iron bars on or they both have a hook on which i think you could use as a fire basket
she is very good bang on let me test you date
i think they're nineteenth century
where in the nineteenth century you've got one hundred years window there
i think they're late victorian bang on you like them what about mum
i think they're horrid i think they're awful they don't seem to flow there's nothing to them i think they're grotesque i do i just don't see any i don't think we'll make a profit on these
i don't know whether you'll make a profit how much are they the ticket price is sixty nine can i give you my opinion i'd appreciate that i think they're absolutely positively wonderful yes you don't i do where where deborah's right either side of a nice fireplace they're a decorator's dream if you can get them for sixty i think they're a bargain fabulous quality they weigh a ton they're not everybody's cup of tea but i think in the right environment they could look a million quid's worth
it's got a screw that doesn't belong to it how do you know cos it's a new screw i'm really sorry deborah but i think these are horrid
it's not my decision guys is it what are you gonna do
everything i buy at auction turns out to be worth nothing everything my daughter buys turns out to be fantastic so i'm going to bow to her knowledge and say yes we will go for them but i'd like to see something off the price
we'll see who's right at the auction
time's up let's find out what the teams have bought first up for the reds their eighteen carat diamond ring how can they fail to make a profit bohemian vase one hundred fifty oh dear finally the fire dogs but are they barking up the wrong tree what's your favourite item
my favourite item the fire dogs
my favourite item is david but he's not for sale so i'm going with the glass
that's terrible forty five change please thank you there you go forty five have you managed to defend yourself today
i didn't try too hard i don't blame you
got any idea what you'll spend it on you've seen these two they're risk takers because of that
i've got my eye on something a bit chancy a bit risky it may not be everybody's cup of tea but it might be an interior designer's dream
we'll leave it in your hands now let's find out what the blues bought they started with a victorian scent bottle will it bring the sweet smell of success at the auction the edwardian crescent brooch was bought for one hundred finally let's hope that eric has some other uncles at the auction in need of a dish you seemed to have fun we had a wonderful day which is your favourite piece
i think the crescent brooch was the one we decided was the most likely to make a good profit
do you like it too it's my favourite that's absolutely peachy you spent one hundred ninety five which is good going one hundred five worth of leftover lolly going to wee anita
with this i'm going to ladle in the profits
nothing to worry about there that's a commercial lot
how do you buy that for forty five if it's diamonds and platinum
i think you were being looked after there you reckon
well it is pretty cheap i'd have thought yeah absolutely without a shadow of a doubt lovely cheap as inexpensive fried potatoes perhaps what's your estimate eighty to one hundred twenty really that's good might be doubling their money on that that'd be a great start wouldn't it just hideous copper and brass and iron things work went into them
there'd be more work going into cleaning them clearly they're part of something greater i can't fathom them they're half ornaments
so you regard it as part of something else and therefore not worth a lot thirty to fifty thirty to fifty very good they paid sixty that is going to be difficult we need some luck there next is this overlaid blue vase they paid one hundred fifty for it
yikes you look a bit shocked there i don't know what it was sold as but there's not the age to justify that price i think that's relatively modern do you it may have been described as bohemian i think it's twentieth century could be post war right it's more likely it's worse than that tim there's a chip yes i think if there was much value in it the chip took that away yes
it's all down to inexpensive fried potatoes again anyway how much for it twenty to forty would be enough they paid one hundred fifty that is a huge hole indeed they're going to need their bonus buy so you girls spent two hundred fifty five yes forty five went to david what did you spend it on
a big lump of flash for very little cash now that's a piece of interior design kit if ever i've seen it
the girls are obviously keen aren't you how much did you pay for it
forty five you were robbed no do you think so you were robbed he looks like a real piece of artwork a bronze that might be worth thousands of pounds
what is it made of i don't know probably concrete you've spent forty five on a piece of concrete
i've spent more on worse i assure you but it's the look it's got the design look but david it looks like he's died
it's awful
what's your prediction as to what it'll bring in this sale room david
well two interior designers would fight over it if we get them here personally i'd pay one hundred for it if i was doing someone's house it would be a great bit of kit
gold nicely graded pearls nice form original case good name
that is not without its faults a little rubbing to the edges of the glass the hallmarks are rubbed on the mounts but nevertheless it should command a price how much eighty to one hundred twenty well that's very good i have to say they paid sixty five
so that could be a bit of a profit super duper last this hideous transfer printed blue and white bowl who's gonna want that will it make one
it may make a few pounds five yeah
they paid thirty what are you putting on it we were generous at ten to twenty you would not put that as an individual lot in a sale ordinarily would you no i don't think it stands a snowflake's frankly but anyway let's have a look at their bonus buy now julia and eileen you spent one hundred ninety five you gave anita one hundred five what did she spend it on
oh very nice i thought it would be that big
that's life i'm afraid
no that's lovely silver
what we have here is a georgian silver sauce ladle now the date is one thousand eight hundred twenty nine so that's quite early but one of the best things about it was the price
how much
twenty
you're joking that's very good
do you like the sound of that yes have a look at it isn't that lovely silver is so cheap i think it's a wonderful thing to buy and a wonderful investment and wouldn't this grace your table
how much profit do you think it will make
it should make substantially more than the twenty that i paid for it and it might double its money
ooh double its money
great anyway for you at home let's find out what the auctioneer thinks about it
it's silver it's georgian yep very very plain and it's not in bad nick
one hundred to one hundred fifty will buy this
it's a rare thing isn't it oh indeed anyway we'll find out in the auction stand by for the second half here we go blow blow blow ah deborah and june and david what a trio
you have never been known to make a loss in the past never that's what you said and on this basis you're doing pretty well you paid forty five and he's estimating eighty to one hundred twenty so you should do very nicely yes however the art nouveau andirons and fire iron jobs thirty to fifty is his estimate and you paid sixty so this could be the first loss that you've ever made in your life
no rather a public way of going about it
but anyway there we go that's his estimate how he feels about them however june you've come up with something spectacular here you spend one hundred fifty on your bohemian vase and the estimate i'm afraid to say is twenty to forty never first up then is your diamond ring and i wish you well

well done i've kept my record haven't i you've kept your record you've made a record loss anyway there we go you were doing very nicely you were twenty three up which means you are minus one hundred seven
so what are you going to do about the old concrete head take it minus one hundred seven could be a winning score go on take a risk
it's either going to bomb and lose a fortune or it's going to make some money no i wouldn't even use it as a door stop
you're going to say no we're going to say no sorry all right we're not going with the bonus buy

forty five yeah plus twenty five more than doubled your money more than doubled your money very good well done anyway plus twenty five means overall you are minus seventy five but that might be a winning score all right you genuinely don't know the score no no no well that's brilliant cos i have to reveal that there is really very little justice in today's result actually the runners up are the reds
oh no
because frankly you got two brilliant profits on the platinum ring and the old andirons very well done on that
thank you we won't talk about the losing item at all
that was unlucky and then you made twenty on the concrete head yes redemption i can't believe that
so out of three brilliant profits let down sadly by one item you are minus one hundred seven which takes some doing i tell you but for the blues the victors who managed to lose on three of their items but made a very jammy little profit on the old sauce ladle courtesy of anita you are only minus seventy five which overall is quite disgraceful but very very good fun join us soon for some more bargain hunting yes yes
they are talking in the sense they are trying to raise the profile of this so that more people are warned about it let's quickly here from nigel evans who is the tory m. p. who has been raising this issue first on the issue of getting the message out
it sounds very attractive to have a job as a financial adviser operating from spain or some other countries people are lulled into this gap year students particularly parents really do need to to ensure that when the youngsters are taking these jobs such as a financial adviser abroad that they are legitimate l. think these newspapers themselves have a responsibility to ensure that these are legitimate activities that the youngsters are getting involved in
an interesting area that nigel evans raised is getting to the embarrassment factor of people who have lost money and are embarrassed to talk about it parents find out if your children have been caught cold by financial adviser of some sort children look to see if it has happened to your parents you have to be open about it
a duo opened ran in the other day and says he knows the name of these people and where they are operating in madrid that when he goes to the authorities nothing can be done l. spoke to a policeman who said that when they go to spain their hands
stock brokers their trade body is the association of private client investors and stockbrokers its campaigning for the government do more about the scam artists david bennett is there chief executive you have been not so much tainted but implemented and implicated in this because people now don't know when your people to contact them whether you'll are kosher how can people be absolutely sure who is calling and that you say you are who you say you are
unexpected call from one of your members surely this is where there is the grey area where people have perhaps ticked a box and a website or got some research information and said yes they will agree to get some other communications they don't remember that so it is unexpected it may not be technically a cold call but that could come from one of your members couldn't it
but you recognise this confusion exists because lot of investment professionals and brokers to call people they are not expecting the calls it's hard for consumers to separate the boiler room calls from other ones
i would only stress that do not as the m. p. said earlier do not send any cheques to any body unless you know that they are official u. k. regulated entities it's critically important because if ever the investment went wrong any chance of compensation only really arises when that a firm is regulated by the u. k. regulator
finally m. p.'s are discussing it this afternoon this must be damaging some of your business because of this suspicion what you hope will come out of it practically
we want to macro things to happen we want more pressure of where these scams are coming out of other european union countries we want the european commission and those member states to have more pressure put on them to implement e. u. legislation to close down these entities and also it's very important in terms of a programme like yours to raise the profile to people to say you have to be sensible when you make investments you should have relationships with people you know before you commit any money
good advice bold action is needed to maintain a postal service that reaches all corners of the country that is the message dave on the industry's regulator postcomm it's putting forward the idea of getting the private sector into bed with royal mail we have the chief executive of postcomm with us now l. have seen headlines saying you are calling for al salad or part brother privatisation of the royal mail is that what you're doing
with the private world a mad outsource something to company x. they may outsource something that is quite different to selling off part of royal mail which prudhoe you taking
i don't think it is for us to decide what form is going to be best what our job is to tell the government that something needs to be done if this service is to be sustained and that some form of access to private capital is required i think it's for the government to consider this and take forward and work out what might be the best mechanism to do this but i think everybody is realising that capital is required transformation is required royal mail has not yet equipped to do it they need to have new equipment they need to have new working practices they need to have new incentives for us to say whether one form of private equity capital or some other form of otsourcing is the only way to do it would be quite wrong
you talked at the beginning of the royal mail having to change because of the explosion of e. mails for instance but that hasn't actually meant that less people post postal volumes are still increasing it's not as if their business has disappeared lots of people want to post stuff they may have complaints about the way best it is treated but there is still a huge demand it's odd that
i saw that you have referred to the models in denmark and sweden what was good about their models that
leave six hundred twenty four thousand tax free this was
something a number of you asked was how do you use the allowance once you have been left one here is john again
using somebody else's nil rate band is quite a simple procedure and in principle it is really down to just your executors filling in a form to say there was a previously deceased spouse and we have got evidence that that nil rate band was not used of course what that tends to suggest is that it is going to be good practice to keep a little record when the first spouse to die how much of the nil rate band is available and keep that with the papers of the second spouse there is nothing formal to be done when the first spouse dies it all gets claimed when the second spouse dies
bank would undertake a rights issue the fact they haven't said they haven't ruled it out but the fact they are not going to do it just yet a number of people were hoping they would
yet if a company does make a rights issue it is bad news for small shareholders because there is more shares being created and they don't want to buy new shares so it dilutes their value
it certainly does if you don't take up rights issue funding from the company then the value in the shares going forward because there will be more shares in place but you will have the same amount of shares you will be diluted therefore in certain situations if it is appropriate people should be encouraged to do so but remember it is really all about increasing the tier one ratios the amount of capital that a bank has to have and a lot of these fundings are making them stronger banks going forward
d. s. g. announced results now that is what we used to know as dixons it also owns p. c. world and currys it's announced it is going to close a number of shops
i think the exact number is one hundred forty four retail outlets are going to close and the concern is that it's got p. c. world on the high street and it's got the old dixons shops they are cannibalising each
well the underlying pre tax profits were fairly flat and i think consensus in the market with b. t. is the growth story going forward is going to be fairly lacklustre but it attracts a very attractive income dividend and my view certainly is buy for the
they are a fancy way to referring to mobile as opposed to fixed line that is the telephone line into your house and the phone that you had at the end you have got the it services that are attached to it so that is what the new wave are and they see themselves moving forward in that line and waiting to see what ofcom have to say in the review of the telecom industry
well i'm a writer and i think people get into a story and you don't have to deal with a company that is going to go down a tube the next week after you have told a story so in many ways the story is about don's rise in his business and the eventual story is about my wife and i a lot of the
let's come to finance in a moment let's talk about when you are setting up that business and you point out the fact there that you can have passion but a lot of passionate people tend to be technical there's technician who is start businesses and that is not always the best place to be in a lot of those businesses fail because of that very point
if you are a good technician you need somebody to come in who is also a good manager because a lot of people are excited they are good doers but they can't manage anybody so that is why you need mentors you know and you need a team of people when you come in to start a business look at your strengths and build people around you that cover your weaknesses don't get people like yourself because you will compound each other's weaknesses
a lot of people watch this programme who are in small businesses or just about to start them up they might say mentoring is all very well but that is for the bigger corporations who can afford the time and the budget and the man and woman power to do it for smaller enterprises that is a pipe dream
a lot of successful businessmen a lot of babyboomers would love to help younger people without any cost ask their advice l. had all kinds of corporation press dents saying let us help you presidents saying let us help you three things you need to be successful in business cash cash and cash
you have a niche that will make a different you can sell some people to help you the big thing entrepreneurs don't involve their people in the finances my wife and i our dream was we wouldn't be the only people losing sleep if there were problems financially we say we have to cut our expenses here we have to do this so involve your people they want you to win too
many people would agree with you give people more financial advice on the finances here never let your expenses outstrip your revenue don't be a banker for your customers then on the other side if you focus on managing costs your business will never grow
you are not going to cost cut yourself to be a millionaire you have to think about what other areas can i go into with our brand look at sir richard branson he has the virgin brand he looks for markets that that brand can also do that is how he has increased his income
do you notice a difference in work ethics from your side of the pond to our side you never take holidays over there you get ten days a year off we like our holidays and we like to work hard and play hard
we ought to take models from you all that is why this priority is in there that is why i love to come over here there's better perspective on business here rather than grinding it out and losing your family and everybody else in the process
apart from the passion the people the profit talk to our viewers they are thinking of jumping off into the deep end of an entrepreneurial business what advice would you give them we have one minute
after seventy two hours some people are still being pulled out alive as the scale of the devastation becomes clear foreign rescue teams are brought in and survivors told of their experiences
suddenly we heard this horrendous noise which you can't describe what it is like just a huge noise and the land shaking underneath you
aware that they are among the lucky few in a disaster on a huge scale for the latest let's speak to dan griffiths who is in dujiangyan there have been some success stories though very few it is a critical time for recovery and rescue of people who may just still be alive dan
absolutely rescue workers here say they are going to work around the clock twenty four hours a day to try to get anyone who might be alive out of the wreckage after this earthquake but the reality is that they have even said to us they now think that finding many more people alive would be nothing short of the miracle
still appeals though for help from the chinese
going to be sichuan is one of the most populous provinces in china and one of the poorer ones we think we are quite fearful this will get a lot bigger
through difficult times l. believe that the tough decisions we make for example on public sector pay will help us but i am not going to predict what will happen what i will say is that we are taking all the action that is necessary to try and steer britain through these times which are producing what people think is a recession in america but we are taking action on the housing market on fuel prices with help with fuel bills and to get more funds to business these are difficult times mainly international factors causing this every other country being affected i will do my best to steer the economy as well as i can
let me ask you about you would you be prepared to stand aside if you believed the only way for labour to win the next election was under another leader
i should continue to do the job i am doing
but if you felt in your heart i cannot win
i will continue to do the job win i am doing
after the prime minister's press conference earlier just how tough is the prime minister finding it convincing people he is the solution not the problem
we are now in a holding pattern i think the prime minister began this week very much on his knees we have now seen him play all his cards earlier we had the two point seven billion tax cut to try to deal with the problem over the ten p. tax band abolition yesterday we had legislation set out in a pre queen's speech today he is bombarding us with interviews news conferences essentially getting his message out it can be summed up in one word i am doing the job getting on with the job the question now is what impact that has on the by election next week and in the longer term as voters think about whether he should carry on leading the government
was fifteen it it was my first offence l. had never been in trouble with the police before i was not brought up to be
involved in crime recently we have they are stealing things like cosmetics and make up which are very easy to steal
sure where they do commit crime we take tough action
there is evidence the police are more willing to take action against girls even for minor offences like playground fights a nineteen year old man has appeared in court charged with the murder of teenager jimmy mizen jimmy who was sixteen died following an attack in a bakery in lee in south london on saturday jake fahri was remanded in custody by sutton magistrates until august the the burmese military government has been accused of preparing to turn a deaf ear to the victims of cyclone nargis some international aid has now arrived but foreign workers have been turned away from the stricken irrawaddy delta there are concerns that hundreds of thousands of people could be facing famine the b. b. c. is banned from reporting in burma but our correspondent sent this report it is still raining in irrawaddy delta more than ten days since the cyclone hit this still cut off from the outside outside world aid workers are not allowed here these are images that burma's generals don't want you to see wreckage and bodies everywhere l. have counted one hundred seven and now i have lost count of the bodies we have passed they are everywhere along the river actually even more terrifying than seeing that is to think about what is happening with the survivors tens of thousands of people are stranded in the villages alongside this river and they are getting no help at all amid what is left of this village we found twenty people waiting all living in the only house that still stands they have no fresh water and no food apart from a little rice we are starving this woman told me for a few days government helicopters flew over us we waved and shouted but nothing happened she says across the delta hundreds of thousands of people are in the same position isolated and desperate for aid that they are simply not getting police in manchester say they were sickened and disappointed at the violence which flared after the uefa cup final between rangers and zenit saint petersburg forty two people were arrested there has been criticism that fans were allowed to drink all day before the kick off our correspondent is in manchester with more for us
the stains in this fans area explain why there is such a smell there are beer and blood marks all over the pavements the rubbish has been cleared away but the violence has tarnished this city it all started when one of the big screens transmitting the match broke down
this is the kind of party manchester didn't want to host around two hundred angry people charged police through the city centre they are throwing anything they can get their hands on out numbers and in retreat one officer falls to the ground and is attacked
they want to take their frustration out on something it was obviously going to be my officer it's the footage of them two hundred of them running after six officers tripping one up and jumping on him like a pack of wolves it's sickening l. can not say it's acceptable no matter how frustrated or upset they were with what happened with the big screen
the technicians who tried to fix it were pelted with bottles and had to withdraw we did have a contingencey plan that was to put up immediately another screen at the velodrome and to bus people with a blue light escort out to that street
well done keep the good job going
jenni francis is customer services advisor but she is also a mum needing to pick her son up from school so it's agreed she works nine hundred a m. until two thirty p. m.
if i didn't get these hours i would be on benefit and doing nothing with these hours i can come into work and have time in the evening to spend with my son
you already have the right to ask to work flexible if your children are under six as parents know supporting children through teenage years at secondary school can also be tricky to parents up to the age of sixteen will also get the same rights if there is a good business reason firms can say no to flexible hours research suggests small companies generally have a better record for saying yes than larger ones still some small firms are worried
ninety per cent of requests for flexible hours are agreed bosses say they find what is good for staff is also good for businesses imelda walsh the author of the report join us from central london she is the human resources director for sainsbury's how useful is it to ask for flexible working if your employer is under no obligation to give it to you
the power of the current legislation is it makes people have a dialogue so the employer has to listen to the employee if they come with a right to request to work differently he has to take he or she has to take that view into account and give a serious reason why it's yay or nai often they will compromise and discuss different ideas to get the objective it's powerful to get a dialogue going
as you heard from that report it's worse than dealing with children saying no to employees can it cause resentment
i myself have personal experience of both saying yes to requests to work differently and also dealing with the issue of saying no nothing in my review today stays that the eight business ground force saying no should be changed or diluted in any way they still exist there will sometimes be good reasons why an employer thinks or she can't adom date that request it's right we start thinking differently about how work is done and recognise that men and women may need greater flicksibility flexibility
give me my phone l. gave it to them and they hit me in the face
so far so good
it's my personal way of saying sorry
been one to go over the top however i will finish and i am going to finish to prove to those who doubted me that i can achieve
the money seb raises is going to the dorset air ambulance he is also going to be volunteering for the life boats
obviously seb's actions when he was fifteen were irresponsible the actions he has taken since then to repay his debt have been admirable it's gret to meet a young man like that
seb won't be home until christmas he is doing twenty miles a day but there are four thousand miles still to go his feet have suffered
my biggest blister was the size of a digestive biscuit on the ball of my foot

russian fans watching last night's uefa cup final say demand for tickets for the chelsea man united game is unbelievable
prices for tickets are hitting the roof even the biggest stop stars like rolling stones or madonna can not sell tickets than what they are asking for the tickets for this final
every year hundreds of british gardeners try desperately to get a place in the yellow book this annual guide published by the national gardens scheme lists private gardens brilliant enough to be open for charity for the few accepted into this yellow book it means the world to share their gardens with the public but out of eight hundred applicants each year only half will get through and with such high standards of entry the assessment is ruthless
at the moment there isn't any interest what has happened
this is a monstrosity i'm going to say no i ought to say no this year i'll say no
in this programme i'll be following avid gardeners striving to turn their private paradises into open gardens today i'll be meeting two couples who are hoping their garden can make the grade
i think it would be a real let down if the county organiser decided it wasn't a very interesting garden
if they say no we really will be very upset
will today's gardens have what it takes to get accepted into the prestigious yellow book our first garden belongs to lise and chris white in gloucestershire this sumptuous english cottage garden is a real labour of love it's taken lise and chris thirty years to transform what was a barren field into a gardener's paradise every corner you turn round reveals new surprises from the walled cottage garden to the sunken courtyard from two pretty little ponds to a really lavish vegetable plot the whole place is full of horticultural delights husband and wife team lise and chris work tirelessly on this delightful garden in between their professional jobs lise is a part time teacher and chris a professional potter
the garden is one of my most favourite places to be i don't feel i need to go off to tahiti because i love being in my own garden
by the cottage there's a flower garden and sunken patio we move up to the water garden with two ponds an orchard a woodland with a summer house and a vegetable plot with lise and chris leading busy lives the garden is a way for them to spend time together
there's a lot of calling out from one side of the garden to the other come and see what i've been doing this goes on a lot
we do share a lot of activities and we do share in the planning
where is it you want it we'll do this bed afterwards let's go and do this one
lise didn't realise how important the garden was to her until a few years ago when she was struck down by a mystery illness and lost her voice for a whole year
i do believe gardening helped me in recovering my voice because of the relaxing aspect of gardening and there was one example particularly when somebody came and called my name from the house and i answered with a voice it showed to me the healing properties of gardening and the relaxing properties of gardening
i think this whole business of opening for the n. g.s is really going to be important for lise because it will validate the creativity she has put into it she's got huge creativity which she never found the right outlet for until she discovered gardening it would be a real let down if the county organiser decided that it wasn't a very interesting garden
with the assessment in a week's time lise and chris have reasons to be concerned even on a rainy day this garden is full of interest there's even a working pottery but this steep slope in front of the two ponds is a bit of a hazard what will the county organiser make of it could it keep lise and chris out of the prestigious yellow book the county organiser for gloucestershire who could stand in the way of lise and chris' dreams is stella martin if her garden is anything to go by the assessment will be really tough
i really wouldn't like to accept a garden if it had an untidy pond which is covered in scum and of course health and safety is terribly important so anywhere that people are likely to fall down must be looked at and avoided
today's second garden is bowling green cottage in west cornwall here just a few miles inland from a coast that is warmed by the gulf stream is the most fabulous collection of ornamental species that you couldn't possibly grow anywhere else in the british isles in some gardens you could be anywhere but here the plants let you know exactly where you are this superlative cornish garden belongs to carol lay and mining consultant husband stephen they've battled against the elements for fourteen years to get it into shape for the yellow book
it's a very tranquil place it's a place where lots of lovely things have happened with family and friends and it's a special place
this twenty five acre site comprises a formal cottage garden near the eighteenth century mine house and a walled garden with mining memorabilia in the top field is a wild meadow and the bottom field is now a woodland with wetland habitat for carol the garden has recently become even more significant
now i spend nearly every day working in the garden having given up my full time job as a teacher to take things easy i work harder now than i used to
getting into the yellow book will be pretty important to carol i think we will be dismayed if we don't get in there we've put in a lot of work to try and impress them
steve and i have quite clear roles in the garden he does the heavy work and i do the nice planting and going off to the nurseries and researching what would look good
we're here for the long term and we're making an environment that we're happy to live in
this is such an interesting garden i had to delve a little deeper so are you both cornish
stephen's cornish and carol's cornish i've lived here since i was three so i'm cornish now
did you choose it because of the location as it feels so cornish
absolutely before we were living in a fishing village but the house was far too small we had no outside at all and this made all the difference did you plant all those trees
no when we planted the field i was working at a special school in redruth i brought my students over and with them we planted eight hundred plus trees in a week
in a week in a week a hard taskmaster i was i was just going to say so why do you want to share the garden with other people
in the middle of last year i was standing out on the terrace and just looking at everything i said stephen this is wonderful we should share it with people he said well do something about it how will you feel if you're not accepted a bit let down having done all this and got as far as somebody actually coming to look and hopefully they will be happy and won't say no
let's keep our fingers crossed for this assessment we hope so with the assessment happening tomorrow they'll need to cross more than just their fingers carol and stephen have got two and a half acres and gardening is not straightforward here at all sometimes even the most basic tasks get pushed to one side when the county organiser assesses the garden is she going to feel there's still just too much to do the person their garden needs to impress is the assistant county organiser for cornwall marion stanley but looking at her garden carol and stephen could be in trouble
when i view a garden without all the qualities the n. g.s looks for i think it's very important to be quite honest and objective it has to therefore come up to expectations
today it's time for our two gardens to face the ultimate test the question is will they be good enough in cornwall marion is on the way to bowling green cottage carol and stephen's two and a half acre country garden
hello hello i'm marion stanley from the national gardens scheme
will the amount of work to be done mean their downfall over at hookshouse the county organiser for gloucestershire has arrived at lise and chris' cottage garden
hi i'm stella martin national gardens scheme
could health and safety issues end their yellow book dreams
so the visitors would come in this way would they
yes also we would have them ending up here we'd have a garden table and chairs here and serve teas
that would be lovely yes
setting an area aside for teas has gone down well in cornwall marion is led straight to the walled garden
oh my word what is that
this is our holman rock drill as you know the house was part of the mining count house no i didn't
for visitors coming in it's a bit of a hazard but the visitors will want to know all about this
it's a mixed reception for the rock drill back in gloucestershire stella comes across the pond area
so this is the pond area yes a little bit untidy here at the moment
we have to own up to that
in cornwall they come across carol's unfinished bed
but this one is completely empty yes it is you intend to match the dry stone wall steve will build another wall
next up for lise and chris is the grass bank
bit of a worry that because it's a bit steep and maybe slippery if the grass is wet i can imagine children playing on the grass at the top then rushing down and you've got the pond here
health and safety is also a concern for carol in cornwall
so this is your enlarged pond our enlarged pond yes our lake the general public if you were to get in the book would you direct them around the ponds yes and we'd have to put signs up to say the water was deep
the assessment is finished and now it's time for the results
thank you very much for showing me round the garden it's good of you to give up your time i'm not too sure about the pond area i think that does need quite a bit of work doing on it the granite mining zone where you've got granite pavements it needs interesting planting there that is appropriate for pavements and the grassy bank at the side that's quite difficult because of health and safety people might slip on that and children might run down there you need another dry stone wall into your meadow walk and the entire bare bed obviously that needs to be planted
will it be a yes or no for lise and chris
so some mixed feelings there i think really all in all i think we would like to welcome you into the national gardens scheme
really
they're in this gorgeous garden will be opening to the public in a mere three months but can they get everything done
alongside feeling really pleased there's also now we've got to get it right and do this work
will carol and her garden in cornwall make it or is there too much work to be done
you've got a little way to go because hundreds of people will want to come and see this garden i hope so so at this moment in time i'm going to say no
carol hasn't got in but she's got four months before marion returns for another assessment
we've done so much work in the garden and it would have been nice to have been accepted first time but she did say if we did the work then maybe she would reconsider so we've just got to knuckle down now and do some planting and do some sorting out
it's been a month since the assessment at hookshouse in gloucestershire although lise and chris will open to the public in two months' time the county organiser did have health and safety concerns over the bank leading to the pond it's lovely to look down on here but i can see what she means about this slope yes i think the temptation would be that your visitors would just want to go down anywhere at all yes but if you had some steps here it would be a real focus and it's amazing how quickly people get the message that that's the way down yes so i think they should be really quite wide steps
so what kind of steps would you imagine for this place you should probably make them from sleepers i like the idea of sleepers
cos they're big simple and if you're in a hurry which we are i think they're a good solution so let's have a go i think that's more sleeper length don't you whenever you're creating some steps in a garden i recommend that you mark them out first using bamboo canes you'll get a real idea of how many steps are needed and how it will look when it's finished
try them out it's almost as if they were there already
all you've got to do now is buy the sleepers dig the holes and put them in once the steps are finished they should resolve any health and safety concerns at bowling green cottage in cornwall carol didn't make it into the yellow book for this year but she's got three months before she's reassessed are you terribly disappointed that you didn't get in
yes i feel a bit let down because i thought we worked very hard and should have been accepted but they were very positive and told us if we worked even harder they would come back and reconsider
this is one area that could have been a problem this is a lovely earth bank you've got a rock wall on the other side but there isn't one here do you want to repeat the planting no i want something different
i was thinking of cannas and grasses make it quite exotic and hot this is more traditional
let's have a look at those cannas over there
these are the plants i was thinking about putting in this bed where have they been over winter the cannas have been in the greenhouse i separated them out and put them in pots i think i've got fifteen now that should be enough
i'm going for this one you've got the biggest i'm not greedy so where do you want them it doesn't really matter
no we've got a bare canvas here
you ought to have several of these
the red ones together and then the other ones together
yeah i love that i think it's beautiful you've got so much light in your garden and one advantage of these canna leaves is when you see them backlit you can see every nuance of their leaves and the thing about cannas is they've got these tuberous roots as long as they don't get frozen and you protect them from the frost you can leave them in the ground and i think the best way to do it is putting a load of soil over the top of where they've died down to that looks about right doesn't it i think this bed is going to look pretty spectacular i'm looking forward to seeing it done
they look good already
getting away from what needs planting let's look at one plant that's already here in their cornish garden carol and steve have the luxury of growing all sorts of things that other people couldn't get away with and this is one myrtle you see it all over cornwall and devon and the tradition was that when a bride was married she'd take a sprig of myrtle from her mother's garden put it into her bouquet and afterwards at her own house she'd plant it again it's covered in white flowers later on and the scent of the foliage and the flowers is unbelievable in gloucestershire there is just one month to go and lise and chris are putting the sleepers into place using the technology used to build stonehenge
it's the critical moment is it going to go in
my reputation depends on it doesn't it right shall we
let go a bit further forward that's it it's in
it fits perfectly it's fantastic well done you measured it correctly all we need to do now is the other six
shall we try it this is our first step
on top of opening for the n. g.s for the first time lise and chris will also have an art exhibition and if that wasn't enough they're opening for a whole nine days
we open from i think it's the twenty sixth of may to the third of june a solid week plus a weekend and then one more day in july
the pressure for one day can be bad enough nine is unbelievable and with all the work still left to be done is it getting to them
i am a bit nervous about being open for n. g.s people coming round i don't know what people are expecting i'm sure lise is nervous too
we're getting on very well working towards the same aim but sometimes we get a bit frightened will we get there it was very tense on saturday we've got too much to do we'll never get there on time will we time will tell
in cornwall carol's hard at work she's trying to make sure that all the areas that led to failure won't let her down second time around
we're trying to plant out the rockery around the rock drill so that when people come they get the wow effect but we still have the rest of the wall to build over by one of the flower beds the n. g.s has become more and more important if they come back and say no we really will be very upset
well it's all very exciting when i woke up i thought this is the day i've got to get up quick at the moment i'm still feeling very tense about it all there's already a car sitting on the yard my goodness it's time to open
lise and chris' divine garden is open and just look how much it's changed once dull borders are now teeming with vivacious colour even the planting around the pond looks breathtaking the new steps have given this part of the garden a new perspective and having sculptures for the art exhibition strategically placed adds to the beauty of the garden it isn't long before people arrive to admire it
there is such a variety of little areas that you can walk into and you're in a completely different environment this is a lovely garden and with the sculptures in it it makes it that little bit more special
out there amongst the sculptures is stella the county organiser
i have no regrets about accepting them for the scheme this garden is looking fantastic i'm really really pleased with it
so have you really enjoyed yourselves
yes it's been really great it was fantastic a really really good day
how much have you made we think about five hundred at least that probably more has anybody commented about your brand new steps i think the steps are a great success
well we had the idea we sort of had the idea but you suggested the sleepers you didn't tell us how heavy they would be and would you do it again yes definitely yes
i'm sure the national gardens scheme would love it cheers
the first day was perfect and chris and lise only have eight more to get through in cornwall it's hours until carol's reassessment at bowling green cottage although she looks calm and collected husband stephen knows the truth
carol is very nervous now the reassessment is about to happen she's spending all hours out in the garden weeding brushing and making it look spick and span
i've come along to lend a little support look at this wonderful wall it's looking pretty good now it has made a massive difference and this is all planted she's due any minute isn't she yeah how are you feeling very nervous i keep seeing another weed poking up let's keep our fingers crossed carol and stephen could hardly have worked harder getting this huge garden to look as marvellous as it does the raised bed looks sensational with its new wall the cottage garden is a riot of colour and the planting in the area with the rock drill really delivers the wow factor carol was after but it isn't me they have to impress it's cornwall's assistant county organiser marion stanley
this is the new wall that we built creating the new walkway through here very effective isn't it i think so it finishes it off with the new flower bed
have they noticed your wall i hope so she's smiling good sign yeah it's looking good isn't it
my word carol you have made some progress this is wonderful a real wow factor feature isn't it it is
we're really pleased with the way it's coming along it's such a change and it's such a feature now
the reassessment is over and now it's time to see if all carol's hard graft has paid off
carol stephen it's been a real delight to walk around your garden you've made so much progress particularly in your walled walk through the drill garden is a real wow factor as far as opening for the national gardens scheme i would very much like to have you on board thank you we'd love you to open next summer
sometimes hard work pays off it certainly does despite the bank balance oh yes ssh
so let's stop him before he follows in his brother's footsteps vernon king he ran the churchill since two thousand six the estate has seen an increase in drug related crime and as you all know he died in his bedsit at the weekend suspected heroin overdose now their leader may be dead but the crew are still there working his corners
word is that king took delivery of several kilos just before he died
that's a lot of smack to sell so i'm hoping that greed and a lack of leadership will lead them to be careless right you all know your targets any questions
what keep moving this is my corner now you feel me
how you doing
i'm a bit busy to be honest
yeah about tonight
yeah we're going to talk about selling the flat
julia wants us all to go round to hers after work
so tell her that you've got other plans
i can't she needs to sort the problem out with the campus surgery
how very convenient we can talk about the flat tomorrow yeah have i got any choice i've got to go listen i really am as serious about this as you are
what's going on
she's been as fidgety as a box of frogs all morning
i reckon she's taken a fancy to the stationery guy
he's in his twenties
life in the old girl yet here we are is that it a car she's gone ga ga over a car no there must be some reason why she's bought some scrap of metal
she thought it would be reliable look i was with her at the auction i tried to push her in the direction of a nice little run around but no she wanted that
nick could i have a word please
i'll put the kettle on
what's up
it's about melody
problem well you tell me you're supposed to be supervising her i know i said i'd take over from joe but melody's a big girl now she doesn't need me looking over her shoulder all the time that isn't just your decision to make
mentoring is an essential part of her ongoing training you know that
then maybe i'm not the person to do it can't george take over
you're a partner nick act like one
in case you haven't noticed i've got important things on my plate too like learning to walk we've all got problems to sort out nick
but as my partner right now i need you to pull your weight especially now that we're trying to get this new surgery off the ground
di moore to all units it looks like they've already elected a new leader it's leon king vernon's baby brother he's seventeen it looks like he's just been a minor player till now so let's stop him before he follows in his brother's footsteps remember these kids are streetwise we need evidence of cash being exchanged for the drugs before we can move
we've got movement five maybe six people approaching the corner
oh no not her
leon leon king what are you doing here
nothing just minding my own you know like you should be
do you really want to end up like your brother
my brother went out like a man doing his thing
and what was his thing selling drugs when he should have been doing what other young people do like what going to college getting a career
that ain't for us we want something and we're going to get it our own way
that's vernon talking
yeah and he didn't like you or your happy clappy clan coming round here ruining business so move on
don't worry we're going need to prepare for vernon's memorial you're all welcome to come pay your last respects and i'll be saying a special prayer for you
save it for someone who still believes
you may have given up on god leon but that don't mean he's given up on you
right o. k. everyone let's refocus on the job in hand
i c. one in silver corsa approaching the target
remember we want them all king and the rest of the gang move on my signal what the hell's she di moore what brings you to the churchill get her in here now what do you think you're playing at
just taking our message to those who've fallen by the wayside
you're compromising a police operation
you didn't mention an operation at the last residents' meeting in fact you never seem to have any answers as to how to curb crime on the estate
we're trying to do something now aren't we but this isn't the way do you want the dealers off the street or not
i want to help these children not criminalise them
when they're locked up there'll be plenty of time to save their souls but in the meantime you and your prayer patrol stay out of my way you pull another stunt like that and i'll arrest you all for obstruction
when you realise i'm right you know where you can find me good bye
what's happening boss what's happening
filth filth
it's too late he's made us
the radio works it's got a very generous glove compartment
right
has it been in an accident i'm not sure this paint job on this wing matches the rest of the car
oh i see what you mean yeah cut and shunt i beg your pardon
it's when they take two halves of two different cars and weld them together
how much did you pay for it again
do you think i've been taken for a ride
no not at all look it's old but it looks like it's been well looked after
yeah personally i'd have gone for something a little bit more sleek and sporty of course
of course but all in all you've got yourself a nice little motor here well thank you for your approval now haven't you both got work to do
how many times you gonna turn the place over you never found nothing when you came to take vernon away what you think he got all the brains in the family hey you're gonna be paying for all the damages you know that
if you wanna be a player leon you've got to get used to this kind of attention
ain't a biggie it's you that's wasting your time see
didn't expect to see you so soon we've got unfinished business really i thought we were both very clear about where we stood
and that's meant to justify the damage you've done to our work on the estate no of course not we've been building relations with the dealers for months now offering spiritual support so that when we've won their trust we can try to persuade them away from crime
but i haven't seen any evidence of a reduced level of drug dealing
and you expect results overnight i didn't expect you to believe in miracles
look i know that getting king and the gang off the streets isn't the answer but it is a start it sends out a message to the gang and the residents that we're serious about tackling this problem
there are plenty of other dealers on the estate why go after leon
why are you so interested in protecting him
because i know he's not a bad boy at heart
he's selling drugs to anyone who'll come up with enough cash
he's taken over from the business his brother built yes but if it hadn't been for vernon's influence leon would have stayed on at school and made something of himself can't you see i'm tired of burying our young ones and what you're doing just isn't working
thanks to you we've had to change our plans king won't be dealing on the streets for a while now
so you're just going to walk away like you always do
not this time we think vernon died from sampling his own gear whether or not he took too much or it's a dodgy batch we can't leave those drugs out there
so why aren't you smashing in doors or whatever it is you do
because i need your help we've searched king's flat and there was no evidence of the drugs i thought you might know if he has access to any other property a girlfriend's place or a lock up garage i only know about his flat so much for your local knowledge
that doesn't mean i can't find out but let me get this straight i won't do anything that puts leon in jail
i'm only interested in getting the drugs off the streets
then i'll help but as long as we do this my way agreed
there she is the lewis hamilton of letherbridge
very funny doctor granger
what you doing a bit of cramming ooh no i'm just seeing what's new
they're always messing about with the traffic laws aren't they
yeah you'll find a lot of changes since you were last on the road
like the invention of traffic lights
and you don't have to stop for mail carriages any more
come on we're only teasing
yes i know it's just
what
i didn't realise there was so much to learn come on vivien you'll pass the theory test easy but what about the practical i thought i'd just jump in the car and it would all come flooding back but it's not that easy is it
you need a friend to take you out for a few refreshers give you a bit of confidence be a calming influence
who would that be exactly
i hope you're all still coming tonight yeah oh yes sure good we'll be there
we're here to remember the short life of one of our own some of you may only remember him for the tragic nature of his death but i want to remember the happy child with the ready smile what he became later wasn't all his fault he had few opportunities to turn away from a life of crime that snares so many of our young ones if only he could have seen that we would have been there for him let us pray
i'm glad everyone could come not everyone's here yet don't tell me ruth still isn't here i spoke to her yesterday she said she might not be able to come did she say why a prior engagement but wasn't this her idea well we can't wait for her has everybody got a drink
i'm not sure that business and alcohol go together
everyone's given up their time let's make it pleasant get the creative juices flowing
i'm just having orange juice
hi thank you you're welcome thank you lovely to see you thank you keep your spirits up yeah leon i'm glad you came
someone from the family had to be here
you know my door's always open if you ever you need to talk
about what loaves and the fishes
you always enjoyed your sunday school
no i think you're mixing me up with someone else why'd you do it why did you blow the police out like that
cos i wanted to give you another chance to see the light
listen i ain't a kid any more i don't believe in your fairy tales working the corner is the only option you got when you're born on the churchill
you could be the one that gets off the estate and makes something of your life show the other kids that there is another way more fairy tales no one's saying it'll be easy but it's not too late to change if you don't i don't want it to be your picture on there have you got five minutes
what for what you can't spare me a few minutes

a bottle of beer with every prescription that would be popular i know i know free condoms
can we just have serious suggestions please
i am being serious
why don't we just go with the open day idea as planned until the corpse put the kibosh on it exactly so we didn't get a chance to show off our wares so to speak
well i think that's a really great idea
yeah good now we are getting somewhere
crosses in a churchyard yeah big surprise what's your point
i put one here for every victim of the churchill not just the gang kids killed fighting over territory that's for fred norris seventy eight years old he had a heart attack after being robbed of his pension just so an addict could get high lucy wilkie six months old born addicted to crack because of her mother's habit frank day postman killed by a stray bullet during a drive by shooting
we know the churchill's a bad place so what's your point
here what take one actually take a handful that's the number of ruined lives you're going to be responsible for if you carry on down the road you're traveling
i'm just giving people want they need no you don't get away from your responsibilities that easily
you may not hold the needle or pull the trigger but there will be blood on your hands leon you're not like vernon i know you can't be happy dealing in addiction and death

get off me
i can't believe you followed me we had an agreement
you might have been able to trust him but i couldn't take that risk leon king i'm arresting you on suspicion of supplying class a drugs you do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when later questioned something which you rely on in court anything you do say may be given in evidence
you were working with them all along no that's not true we can still work this out
i'll give evidence explain that you were going to give up the drugs
yeah and we just let everyone know i've been co operating with filth no you're gonna keep your mouth shut i'll do my time and you know when you see me on the street keep your distance cos the boy leon you used to know is gone
what have you done i've taken the drugs off your streets no you've removed the one person that could be the catalyst for real change
one week in a proper job and he'd be back on his corner lining his pockets with easy money
and if you're wrong
ten years in sunday school and he still turned into a dealer now we'll do it my way
your way the graveyard or the jail those are the only options you're offering these kids
maybe prison will prove to be more of a deterrent than your prayers

it wasn't that long ago you set up the mill
i know but i had mac's support then this time i feel as though i'm on my own you must miss joe yeah it's just that nick's so preoccupied with his recovery he's not pulling his weight maybe finding that body on the first day was a sign that this is one expansion too far

thank you so much ladies and gentlemen thank you thank you hello and welcome to through the keyhole the show that gives us a peep into the homes of some of britain's most fascinating home owners to find out what's in store today let's go straight now to our special home investigator lisa snowdon
do you feel the need for speed could you be an easy rider hit the road on a harley or would you just as soon stay at home and play with your gadgets listen carefully i'll try your patience with a story you'll find difficult to cap but i'm sure if you watch carefully i'll convert you the clues are all there but who's playing the game today
well playing the game today of course is our panel and what a panel they are there's i. wan thomas gloria hunniford
i'm in london chiswick to be exact and even though i've never been to this house before i found it without any trouble thanks to this handy gadget i know i'm here the satellite navigation system
you have reached your destination
oh shh isn't this a trendy place i love what they've done with it this is a young person's pad and it's truly modern living there are interesting touches a hint of the east with the buddha figure and these pretty roses set around him almost like an offering the white walls work really well and this black and white print is the perfect choice i've never seen a fire like this it's an unusual design and bang up to date i think this is someone who likes the latest gizmos a definite trendsetter well it's easy to see what they like reading stuff about motorbikes barry sheene carl fogarty the complete racer and i like this title mick doohan thunder from down under crikey mate and then there's the travel morocco barcelona los angeles rome delhi san francisco they seem to have been everywhere and when they've reached their destination where else to stay than a hip hotel that's a nice place i've been there that one's kinda cool yeah it's quite wonderful how they've transformed this space and opened it all up this is a fabulous kitchen slash den slash dining room and it's super modern with all the latest gadgets this kettle boils in three seconds and this super duper coffee machine beans go in here coffee comes out here so no grinding whirring whizzing or wheezing uh uh indian mexican thai italian the vodka cookbook ooh this sounds good lobster steamed in vodka with vodka tarragon dipping sauce bring it on another fabulous space and what an eye for design it's quite futuristic but classy in summer so i'm told this huge door opens out into the garden bringing the outside in and they support wolverhampton wanderers it's modern and trendy upstairs with this fabulous bathroom come wet room don't you just love this bath i can't help but notice these motorcycle helmets up here and there's a riding hat now you would feel a bit of a fool walking around with this on with no horse maybe i'll find manly leathers in the bedroom let's go look and a bedroom to die for but where are the manly leathers let's take a look at the clues again the trendy design the need for speed and the love of gadgets who lives in a house like this david it's over to you
i'm right in believing we're looking for a female here in this house
there's a lot of male
there's a lot of manly things motorbikes things like that this is a girl who's very much into her gadgets and her outdoor life adventure
adventure gloria
the clues in the film i felt were quite misleading cos it's a very feminine house a beautiful house very softly put together with candles and cushions and yet there are very hard edges throughout the whole film as you say the bikes and the horse riding the bikes almost seem like too obvious to me is she anything at all to do with riding
the bikes
not riding the bikes horse riding because of the
i think i think i think
they're both to do with her life one more than the other
actually the things that strike me she's obviously somebody who's very very modern like a bit of edge got a bit of edge to her and i think because of that then it's not horse i think it's motorbikes
i think you're right
you're looking at a girl here who's i hope i can say this who's very attractive but she's one of the boys as well she'll get stuck in i think there's a lot of clues there with gadgets we're talking about well i think i know but
i think you do when you talk about her being attractive you really know don't you go on tell us who it is
it's suzi perry
it's suzi perry
well done well done
suzi perry it is but unfortunately suzi can't be here because she's away working on location and reporting and so on so we've recorded her conversation we've talked to her and we'll bring it to you right now suzi it's great to be here in your house and i can see you've got a lot of cutting edge design and gadgets here that's hardly surprising with your eighth series on gadgets
yes i'm a bit of a gadget girl so if something can be done with a gadget i've invariably got it in my house design is something that i absolutely adore i like kind of clean lines quite sort of modern feel but quite cosy and homely as well
yes how does it feel to be the face of motor cycling a rather daunting title
it's great and you know i feel very comfortable with it now this is my twelfth year in motorbikes so i feel like i'm an old shoe in the paddock i'm very comfortable and part of that they feel like they're part of my life it has been the spine of my career i just adore bike racing i find it so exciting
did you love it as a girl or did you come upon it later
later really in my mid twenties i kind of got into it and i loved watching the overtakes i find it very exhilarating i just couldn't believe what they were doing and then i was hooked and then i just became really passionate about it and obviously that was quite a while ago
what's the most exciting race that you've watched
goodness it's really hard to pick one race but i tell you the most exciting season that was in two thousand six when nicky hayden and valentino rossi were tussling for the title you couldn't have scripted some of the things that happened every single race had you on the edge of your seat you know hairs standing up on your arm it was fantastic really great motor sport real racing just what bikes are all about
and are the skills required by winning bike rider the same for a racing car driver or are they different
the rider has a lot more input to the race results than you would say in formula one just because you've got a great bike it doesn't mean that you're going to win a race for example you have to be an excellent rider you have to be super fit you have to know when to make the right moves you've got to be really brave i think you've got to be a little bit crazy as well
is it more dangerous than motor racing now
it's more dangerous than car racing because you haven't got anything around you there's no roll cages it's you all you've got between yourself and the floor are a set of leathers effectively so they have to be really good and the guys are coming off all the time but it's just such a spectacle to watch
one of the most adventurous things you've done yourself is only fools on horses for sport relief and you had what only three weeks to learn how to do it from scratch
well i learned from scratch i'd never ridden a horse at all we had to learn to become showjumpers in it was about six weeks altogether but obviously still working through those times as well so it was the biggest challenge i think i've ever taken on in my life
was it painful absolutely david it was so painful
i got thrown off my horse so many times to start with i could barely walk at night i'd be sleeping surrounded by pillows all over my body cos i couldn't bear anything touching it was hard work but wow by the end i was showjumping and it was just brilliant really good
do you still ride horses a bit or was it just for that challenge
i've carried on riding i haven't carried on showjumping that's obviously more of a specific art and sport and so on but i really enjoyed it and i've been on a hack down richmond park going on lots of hacks and things and i love it it's kind of like being on a motorbike but you've got an animal with a brain
do you like riding motorbikes as well as watching yes yes and commentating and all that
a lot of people still say to me do you actually ride and yes i do ride i've ridden for about twelve y. e. a r. s. and the feeling of freedom being on a bike riding along that feeling of independence actually the best feeling is when you're going through traffic
i was just thinking that coming here tonight my goodness me there was a lot of traffic but you would have been fine on your motorbike
exactly definitely the best way to travel
and you've done other different things like royal ascot and so on
yes what are your ambitions to do
what are the things you haven't done yet
goodness it's really difficult you know well you know when you're doing something that you love doing you're passionate about it's kind of difficult to think about doing anything else really i love what i do i love playing games on the gadget show and i love watching the bike racing so i'm really happy i'm actually not super ambitious to go and conquer the world or anything i just want to enjoy what i'm doing
and lisa referred to this in the film but you're a wolves supporter
yes how did that come about i'm from wolverhampton originally really yeah it's my hometown i think when you're from a footballing town a working class town if you like like wolverhampton it's in your blood and i do i'm a big wolves football fan
it's absolutely delightful to be here in your home
thank you for coming to my house
it's a treat and i've got something here for you it's the through the keyhole key
yay the sacred key thank you your latest gadget brilliant there you are
thanks a million for being with us too
my most blingiest gadget ever that is i love it
that's pure gold all the way through of course thanks a million thank you suzi perry there suzi perry our thanks to her for that interview and now let's join lisa at house number two and watch closely because the clues are there as we go through the keyhole
well the power boat the references to testosterone the magazines this is definitely not just a man but a bloke
very well put
judging by the washing and the untidiness here and there a bloke who lives on his own
very good there's no woman in that particular
that we know of
i recognise a few things in his lifestyle to mine are we looking at a professional sportsman the reason i say that is the magazines all the games a bit of spare time someone who may train in the morning have the rest of the day to relax and i think we'll be looking at a rugby player
and why did you say rugby player
i say rugby because there is a reference to if he was in trouble he would call upon his twelve mates that makes thirteen
thirteen rugby union
and the fixtures the fixtures
and also a reference to wasps which is a well known rugby team
rugby union is fifteen
it'll be rugby league then rugby league is thirteen ain't it i thought union union is fifteen yes
this is undoubtedly rugby union
so why did she say you'd need twelve mates
which would make thirteen she didn't know
does he play internationally he plays for wasps definitely
we think he plays for england
well we think no it's not
you tell us who you were going to say
i was going to say lawrence dallaglio
oddly enough he will play a part in the story but it's not him he plays a part in the story
he obviously is a team member because he plays for wasps as well
did he play in the england team that won the world cup the webb ellis trophy four years ago
i'm not sure about four years ago he played in the team that didn't win the world cup last year
is he a winger by any chance that's his position i've got one of a few in my mind i don't know whether
go for it boys go for it go on
is he quite new to the rugby scene in terms of he's made a breakthrough for england in the last season or two
yep yep
i don't want to say if it's wrong say it can't remember the first name is it paul sackey
good for you
come through the keyhole paul sackey and his wasps colleague and flatmate tom voyce and this is paul as you know and this is tom and how long have you been wasps colleagues and how long have you been flatmates
i've been at wasps for four years now
i've been there five yeah we've been living what eighteen months two years yeah two years
does it make good sense to do that
he's the woman of the house
pardon
he's the woman of the house you wish
basically he's quite lazy so i have to do the cooking
so you make sure everything is shipshape
i had to try and get him here his running to schedule's really bad basically
and how did you come to choose the apartment riverside apartment
just liked the look of it i think two boys at the time we were young free and single as they say saw it and thought it was an ideal place to be you're young once you've got to enjoy the london life as much as the rugby so that's the decision
how much time does rugby take up during your week monday to friday if there's not a game
if there's not a game not i don't think there'll be too much cos we wouldn't have to train that much so
you don't
if there's not a game we may not be training full on like we would if we were preparing for a game so i'd expect it wouldn't be as intense as what it would be like if we were training
and he's lazy so wouldn't want to train when he gets the day off he's on the sofa
and how many caps have you got together so far for england
i've got nine i'm on fourteen at the moment fourteen yeah
and wasps is about the most famous name in club rugby in britain
yes i think we were told a couple of days ago
in the professional era so we've won a few trophies i've been lucky enough to be there five years and won six trophies so it's quite good
there was a time that people said that the southern hemisphere would always beat the northern hemisphere at rugby wasn't there and then when we won the world cup that looked different yeah
yes
but now how's the balance today do you think between southern hemisphere and the northern hemisphere
i think it's quite equal now obviously there was one northern and southern hemisphere team in the final at the world cup so the balance is getting quite even at the moment obviously the european teams are doing really well france are doing really well we've done really well in the last four years
ahem wales
we pause there for a brief commercial
wales is doing all right at the moment because obviously the new coaching staff
they've got an englishman coaching them
and tom your family rugby goes right back in your family
fantastic paul you nearly ended up as a soccer player didn't you with crystal palace was it
yeah i wish i was now only joking no
you mean they're paid more i would have been in a bigger flat
i'm only joking i don't regret this situation i'm in at the moment i went to a school that predominantly played rugby so
so that decided it in the end
it was forced upon you wasn't it
and how do you fitness is one thing but how vital in your case how do you maintain speed do you train to increase your speed
i do and i've got a personal trainer outside of rugby as well margot wells alan wells's
alan wells the great sprinter
yes so i go to see her that's how i keep my speed up and she's done really well for me i'm really really glad i'm with her
do either of you have superstitions or things you do before a game
well the boys take the mick out of us quite a lot because obviously we're joined to the hip they think and we rock up in one car go into the changing rooms got the music blaring in our ears mucking around having a laugh the boys are bashing their heads against the wall trying to get psyched up for the game and we take it pretty easy when we cross the white line and the whistle's blowing that's when we switch on but we like to have a laugh quite relaxed really
so you don't go through incantations like the maoris do
no we have a set morning don't we he gets up he's the woman
he gets up and cooks breakfast
very nice yes very nice
nice poached eggs or scrambled eggs
but i can cook well he thinks can cook you know i can cook
i suppose that's the only little superstition is cooking the eggs for the man apparently
cooking eggs which way does he need them
right he's the fussiest guy in the world if i cook him scrambled they can't be too runny you've got to have them a little bit runny but they've got to be hard with poached eggs the yolk's got to be hard as well no no
he's got to have tomato sauce i've got to have h. p. sauce so yeah
so that's the way that's the tradition of getting yes i think people from other rival countries seeing this will
they'll be scared won't they they'll adopt this system
rochester is known as the city of great expectations because it's in that charles dickens novel and i've got great expectations for our valuation day today on flog it charles dickens loved rochester with its quaint shops and houses and the feeling is mutual because every year the locals hold two festivals in his honour i've been told there are a few people around here that like to get dressed up as dickensian characters so who knows what surprises we're going to find inside looking out for the old curiosities are our mutual friends philip serrell and elizabeth talbot we can rely on them not to miss anything out of the ordinary
elizabeth has already found something this strikes me as a flamboyant clock for a flamboyant gentleman
thank you very much what can you tell me about it it comes from my wife's side of the family right we were on the point of moving and it fell off the mantel shelf it got a minor bit of damage but it's a beautiful old clock i'm interested in clocks but i think it's time to go
before it falls off another shelf yeah strictly speaking it's a timepiece because it doesn't strike it tells the time only it's in a silver case which is as decorative on the back as it is on the front so whoever made this was very proud and good at showing off his craft the face of it is beautifully decorated with this little cherubic figure wistfully looking at the sun as we've been doing recently yeah some damage including the loss of the hands but it can be rectified and then this very sumptuous rich case it's flat silver which was stamped out with this three dimensional design of scrolls and cherubs vases of flowers all very very rich and exciting from a clock specialist's point of view there's nothing exciting it is just a timepiece but it is by the british united clock company and that guarantees the quality of its manufacture so it's a lovely item i would expect it to sell realistically somewhere between one hundred eighty and two hundred fifty it should be protected with a reserve which i would advise being about one hundred fifty if you're happy
and it's realistic for the condition it's in
lovely does that sound good yeah
and having sold this lovely item which you've known for a long time what might you then do
i think we might go to portsmouth and the home club and have a short break
sounds nice we'll see we'll see what we do for you
thank you very much
my mum and dad like it did it come down the family yes my dad acquired it somewhere it's always been in the family
do you know how old it is no i know it's quite old
maybe victorian yeah victorian
second half of the nineteenth century the victorians were prolific in producing crescent brooches star brooches and target brooches all in this design this is a little star brooch diamond set in gold and very often the brooches that they produced would have been used either as pendants so this fitted on to the end of a chain or they were used as a brooch this is diamond and gold but it's very very black yes why i don't know someone said it might have been exposed to heat has it been in a fire not to my knowledge it's just been tucked away the auctioneers will weigh the diamonds we weigh diamonds in carats it'll give you a more accurate valuation i think at auction this will sell quite well these are sought after i would think that is gonna make at auction probably between four hundred fifty and five hundred fifty lovely i'd put a reserve on it of four hundred so below that price you have it back
are you happy with that yes lovely what would you spend four hundred fifty on
i'm going to australia to visit my sister next year my mum would love to come with me so i think it'll go towards that
i don't like to see family things sold but in this instance
we've seen many pelham puppets on the show before some of them very collectable but we've never seen a pelham puppet like this one it's donald duck and it belongs to lynn thanks for bringing him in
i've read about them and i've seen them in the books but i've not met a character like this one and he's very heavy what's his history i was given him fourteen years ago when my son was born
by my brother in law who did a house clearance and i was the only one with a young child in the family so he gave him to me was it a son or a daughter my son what's his name ryan
ryan's obviously played with donald duck and gone ooh you can hang this from the ceiling and he'll bounce up and down
i'd hang it in the doorway inside the kitchen door
how come they started doing disney ones i'll tell you why
the demise of the pelham puppet was walt disney animation entertainment was very basic it started off really with muffin the mule everyone had puppets then suddenly everybody started having t. v. sets walt disney films came out and animation killed off pelham puppets rather than be beaten he joined the bandwagon if you can't beat them join them exactly that's the way forward he made a lot of characters like this why do you want to sell him now
hopefully he'll go to someone that knows how to restore him he's just been stuck in a box so i'd rather him go to someone who can do something with him
there are a lot of pelham puppet collectors they'll like this one donald duck is a great favourite any idea of the value i haven't got a clue
one hundred something like that
do you know you're bang on i'd like to see this do one hundred i was going to put a value of eighty to one hundred twenty i know it's an auctioneer's cliche but i think it's his market value shall we flog him yeah i hope he goes to a good home he will
i'm so excited to see this lot grace and bruce i understand despite the fact this service looks so pristine it's had quite a story and has travelled a fair way yes
it was originally made in england and shipped to what was rhodesia now zimbabwe and four years ago we shipped it back again with us
so you've had it over forty years
forty three years it was a wedding present really
a very generous wedding gift yes so you've used this dinner service over the years we have yes it looks as though it's been never touched but you've obviously
it doesn't come out as often as it used to we don't entertain as much now we feel that it's a collectable item and perhaps we should realise its value
obviously you know that it's midwinter but you also know about the designer and the artist
n.
it's made by the midwinter factory and they were in operation between nineteen ten when it was established by william midwinter and it operated right through to about nineteen eighty seven some famous names besides hugh casson have links with this factory such as the younger terence conran so some very high flying designers of the twentieth century have contributed designs during the mid twentieth century jessie tait was commissioned by william midwinter to create this rounded square shape which was then copied by a lot of lesser factories you and i agree that it's very much of the period but it looks very much now as well modern yes now there are lots of pieces this isn't the whole set
we have the complete dinner service and the tea set coffee set and fruit set for six people amazing
to see one or two pieces is something we might expect but to see so much in such lovely condition is really exciting you've thought about selling it do you know what it might fetch or you hope it might achieve we were hoping at least four hundred
around about that figure that figure yes yeah
i think realistically anywhere between probably three hundred fifty and five hundred fifty would be a fair bracket value yes yes but i would advise a reserve of about three hundred fifty
we would be happy with that it's a well known cannes pattern
and it's one that people will be looking for so i think it's a fair assessment thank you thank you
it's time to head to the saleroom where the bidders will take a shine to ron's flamboyant timepiece and the diamond star brooch is sure to sparkle but will the bidders go quackers for donald who's past his prime and what's in store for the huge midwinter collection for our auction we've moved to the canterbury auction galleries on a very hot sunny day let's catch up with auctioneer tony pratt his job is to get the best possible prices we have a classic here midwinter it's a service for six people it was brought into the valuation day by bruce and grace our experts have put three hundred fifty to five hundred fifty on this they've had it forty three years they're flogging it for money towards a trip to south africa will we get that price
i think so it's a good quality service in wonderful condition it's as if they've never used it it's in mint condition
that's what the collectors go for it's got to be in good condition
will we get the top end or more
we'll certainly get the top end could you see six hundred six hundred fifty it's a possibility yes has there been much interest yes
that's all you need two people that fall in love with it and you can work it up a good auctioneer
i hope so earning the commission i'll do my best thanks a lot
that's coming up later but first it's time to sell ron's clock it is a lovely timepiece a lot has gone into this i hope we get around two hundred you must be sad to see this go
it is a beautiful clock but time is time and things must move on
it's true were you happy with the valuation yes that was put on by elizabeth this should do the top end
it's super quality i've never seen one quite like this the clockmaker is very good so fingers crossed
lot one hundred seventy three the late victorian mantel or dressing table timepiece william commins london one thousand eight hundred ninety one hundred
we're in we're in
one hundred thirty one hundred forty one hundred fifty one hundred sixty who's one hundred sixty one hundred sixty where selling at one hundred fifty one hundred fifty then

this jewellery isn't as popular as it was but it's jolly good value
brooches aren't popular but it's so nice and it's so tiny that a dealer won't buy it to break up and turn it into something else brooches aren't fashionable but let's hope this one is good luck and i know the money is going towards a trip to australia

we're gonna take that brilliant that's not bad is it that's gonna get you back to south africa for a holiday have a great time thank you what a good result i'm so pleased
thank you a pleasure well done
our landscape would look entirely different if it wasn't for bees bees have been around for millions of years even stone age man would capture wild bees for their honey but bees have a much more important job to do bees are pollinators which are vital for the pollination of plants including crops we grow for food one third of the human food supply depends mainly on bees nowadays lots of farmers hire hives from beekeepers and put them in their fields beside their crops to make sure they get pollinated i've come to flynn's bee farm on the isle of sheppey beekeeper terry clare will tell me all about it and hopefully there's no sting in the tail terry thank you for inviting me down here it's a great pleasure i'm quite nervous but very excited
you don't have to be frightened the bees here should be fairly gentle
i've always been interested apparently since the age of six that's a few years now i find everything about how the bee works how its society operates and the fact it's a proper community human beings are still tribal as you can see from football matches bees aren't like that they're very communal and it's an entirely feminist society all the workers are female and do all the work and get the job done
shall we get booted and suited i think so let's go right this is gonna be fun right off to work we go actually terry it doesn't look like the classic beehive i know as a schoolboy the one you see in winnie the pooh the skep why don't you use those
what's the hierarchy what's their work ethic
it's no wonder terry's so fascinated by bee society the female worker bees collect nectar to be made into honey and pollen for food drones are the only male bees in the hive and mate with the queen she then lays one egg in each cell to be fed by the worker bees
let's see what's in this frame we're seeing in the cells which are sealed worker larvae which are turning into adult worker bees the shiny liquid is nectar which is being turned into honey and you can see in some parts a yellow hard substance that's pollen they need the pollen for feeding their young and for feeding the queen
what's the lifespan of a bee the worker in the summer six weeks
but in the winter four months because she's not doing any work as such
how long will the queen bee live for for four to five years
but most efficient beekeepers let her live for about two years and then her egg laying dies off
is the queen bee in there now yes can we have a look at her of course you can i'll take her out are they threatened that you're taking the queen out these bees are calm and easy to handle
you can see the queen down there she's got the spot on her back crawling along the bottom
she's slightly bigger
her abdomen the bottom third of her body is much much larger that's where all the egg laying is done from
that's the first time i've seen a queen bee she's lovely looking
she's a dark bee pure race which they used to call the black bee yes it's native to this country if you'd like to hold that one oh my word here goes hold it carefully look at that these bees are very calm you can run your hand over and it doesn't disturb them
that is unbelievable what a fantastic sight hundreds of bees there all having a role to do knowing exactly what they're doing that is a hive of activity thousands of bees
they do have different roles at different stages of their lives they perform specific jobs we even have morticians undertakers it's a good illustration how a particular animal has evolved to a higher level in some respects than human beings yes
sue brian husband and wife yes you have to check these days whose are these they're mine have they come down the family
i inherited them from an aunt about forty two years ago
would the world cave in on you if she knew you were selling them
i don't think she'd mind
let's turn them up and see what they tell us there we are we can see that they're crown devon hand painted by walter lamonby bizarrely this is all decorated with the same scene a hunting scene which of course is now banned
yes and it's john peel
who was a famous north country huntsman and everybody knows the first few words of this verse d'ye ken john peel so all of this is by them we've got a jug with this moulded decoration all the way round and a fox we've got a little tankard that's got the hunting crop there and again moulded decoration then we've got this hunting scene again with john peel and the fox this one's a bit different yes as if by magic this one is interesting it's a musical decanter that little sprig stops it or lets it play it plays d'ye ken john peel we've got the full complement of john peel what do you think it's worth my husband thought he saw this one
yeah on television i think it was about sixty
i think that for auction we ought to estimate the three pieces at one hundred to two hundred i think if you can get two people there competing against them they could make well over the top estimate but i think one hundred reserve possibly with a little bit of discretion hunting things don't make the money they used to perhaps fifteen years ago are you happy to sell them yes aunty wouldn't disapprove no what would you spend the money on we've been talking about that
we've got a reputation for getting lost when we travel we might put it towards satellite navigation
i nearly ended up in rochdale instead of rochester we're local so we didn't get lost coming here are you happy to put them in yes we'll see what benefit john peel actually brings sylvia what a wonderful pair of ewers you think so
i'm not really very fond of them at all are you not no they were handed down to us from my husband's mother who received them from an elderly german lady who we think brought them out of germany during the second world war
right she then emigrated to rhodesia as it then was
subsequently zimbabwe where we've come from so they've done a full round trip
quite international germany to africa and back to europe what don't you like about them i think it's the angular design
i don't know really i just found them rather ugly
you're being honest that's good they were made by the shortened title of the firm is wmf which is a german factory it was a metal foundry which opened in the one thousand eight hundred eighties and they gained such a reputation for stylish designs of the art nouveau influence which were retailed through outlets such as liberty's stylistically although they're very angular the knop on the handle the designs which ran all the way down sinewing down to the feet these splayed feet is so very art nouveau and they are unusual because you have two of them very often they become separated from their partner and they're pewter which was silver plated in terms of value it's the lower end of the type of metal they used when they were new they would have been bright and shiny on the underside you can see the wmf mark for the factory and e. p. which means electro plated now wares of the wmf factory are highly collectable if you were happy to enter them with a reserve of perhaps two hundred fifty which means the estimate would be two hundred fifty to four hundred that sort of level would you be happy with that say if you're not not at all
my husband said he would prefer a reserve of about three hundred
we don't want to twist your arm we can have three hundred with discretion
michael how are you doing not too bad where does this come from
i've done some work for an old boy
gardening and he gave me that
how long ago about twenty years ago i quite like this it's quite fashionable it's bavarian black forest carved wood you get a lot of those bears done from about one thousand eight hundred eighty through to nineteen twenty this is of that genre you know what it is yeah a boar's head you know what it's for pipe rack yes these little metal racks here if you look at it from the back can you see where it overlaps
yeah and again just there there's an overlap
but i think it probably did it's just a sweet little thing very commercial how much gardening did you do how much were you owed twenty years ago
not a lot ten quid something like that yeah maybe that
what do you think this is worth would you take thirty quid
yeah i suppose so excellent hold on just a minute
i think he'll make between one hundred and two hundred
blimey is that good excellent i didn't think that much didn't expect it to be that much
he's not quite such a boar now i reckon an estimate of one hundred to two hundred we'll put a reserve of eighty if you have a result on the day it could easily make top end estimate it's a really good fun thing do you like it yeah i like it
it was just lying about so it's got to go
what would you spend one hundred fifty quid on i'd take the family out for a meal if it makes two hundred can i come my brother's getting married in july your son yeah this is my dad let's hope it does well fingers crossed
it's off to the auction with the crown devon pots as long as sue and brian don't get lost on the way the pewter ewers are stylish if not to sylvia's taste some bidders can't wait to get their teeth into the wild boar pipe rack i absolutely love this and i could see this on my wall in my house lovely pipe rack black forest carving the bears are so popular this is a wild boar we've got one hundred to two hundred on it if that was mine i wouldn't be selling it great bit of fun
beautiful carving for the centre
what we need is two pipe smokers in the room bidding each other up but the decorators will love this too and it's a great talking point
it's a great bit of fun and that's what it will be sold as
you'd have this on your wall i'd love to take that home he's almost quite tactile he's ugly but at the same time cute
the carving is so good quality and so crisp
i'd like to see this do over two hundred two hundred fifty two hundred eighty
i think the two is the right level to aim at but we'll do our best
i always aim high i love aiming high fingers crossed on this one
keep the estimate nice and modest and hopefully off we go
i've just been joined by sue and brian they're flogging these crown devon jugs for some sat nav cos you keep getting lost let's hope we get the top end of our valuation of one hundred to two hundred put on by philip will the hunting scene put people off i don't think so there's always demand for jugs
there's a good crowd here today they'll do well good period too absolutely let's hope we can get you that sat nav with the top end of our estimate
so we don't end up in a ditch
good luck hopefully the bidders are here i like nice jugs they're going under the hammer now
three items in one lot lot thirty one who'll start me at one hundred seventy five to start
come on seventy five where seventy five i have eighty where

we had a chat about this next lot with tony sylvia's pewter ewers lovely pair great maker's name wmf that should sell them the big question is sylvia will you be sad to see them go
no because you hate them don't you i do yeah i don't like the shape of them i just don't like them where have they been in the last few months sitting on a shelf where i didn't have to look at them behind my chair where i sit
you had your back to them yes just like a horse who had the huff with another horse that's what the name of the game is we flog it good luck with that let's hope we do get that top end i hope so too it's going under the hammer now

just look at the varieties we've got here look at those they really are fantastic loads and loads of lovely eggs there all different colours how much did you spend then hel obviously the eggs were free because they came from my chickens
well i know you're not great on spicy food too much spices but we're going to do something here we're going to do some sort of ragu with this and maybe some homemade cheesy dumplings to go with it
oh yeah and then with this we're going to do a really lovely roasted rocket and tomato style salad
we'll make this up i might do some sort of sweet potato crush and use this for a sweet and a savoury definitely a salsa of some description we'll make it up as we go along sounds delicious to me
andy first job i want you to do for me is clean up these prawns so what i want you to do is take the head off whip the head off with my hands yeah with your hands whip the head off of three of them for me
yeah off with the flesh then run a knife just down the back there
you've got some knives there andy i might have to kill a few of these all right you will yeah i'll give you those i'm a vegetarian you know that get out of it what are you actually going to be doing
yeah and the prawns so i'm going to blend that with a little bit of egg white
don't take the head off that one a little bit of double cream make our own pasta all right then
and then that's part of them and the rest of them we're going to i'm going to make a tempora batter and serve that on a nice spinach and balsamic dressing nice and busy then spring onions and then third aspect to the prawns will be grill those and serve them with a little bit of red pepper pepperard which is a cooked down bit of onion no colour
do you put any sugar in there white wine sugar sometimes
red wine vinegar red wine vinegar a touch of sugar that's going to be interesting
now you're known as the stirfry king aren't you
i am known as the stirfry king yeah i've a secret recipe secret ingredient
it brings out the flavour the taste wow i sound like i know what i'm talking about
no but you enjoy it i do a lot of people don't realise that lime it's not like lemon it's a completely different taste
they begin with the same letter but the differences are endless
thank you very much two minutes gone already
i'll let you get on with this and come back and see how you're getting on
it's a mango mango and honey cakes
she's doing a pretty good job she takes her eggs everywhere with her doesn't she eh who will buy this wonderful morning
i need one of those eggs thank you absolutely fantastic
butter sugar yeah and i'm going to now put in a little bit of extra honey if i can find it and we're going to finish it off with a honey syrup and mango on the top when you've done that mango i just want you to put it in there
righto chop it up into nice chunky pieces chop it up right
yeah and i just want to get this into the oven out of the way look at the colour of those eggs
i know that's what i'm saying
look at the speed it's all frantic
i know what is it about all these eggs how many varieties of chickens have you got
it's got out of control i started like most smallholders a couple of chickens for the garden so went and got some hybrids yeah chickens just bred to lay eggs and then you start getting a few pure breeds and then you get obsessed and then i bought an incubator and i hatched my got some rhode island red chicks at home that are only a week old i had proper easter chicks i can tell which chicken laid which egg yeah that's a cream legbar that lays a blue egg
just point at them there love that's it go on
i wouldn't eat that egg transylvanian naked neck
yeah that was the first attempt from the french copper maran see how tiny it is and then later on they produce an egg of that size
yeah that is fascinating isn't it yeah i just thought i'd bring the two extremes in just to show you what you can find in your nestbox in the morning
yeah cooking for what eight to ten minutes yes probably hopefully they're not going to take long because there's not much mixture in there we're going to do a nice hot honey and we may put a herb through that i mean i think mint and lime and honey with the mango will work really well
frantic what's actually been achieved in that time we've got our pepper on so i sweated down a little bit of garlic there ainsley
uhuh in the olive oil a little bit of sliced onion yeah
then i've added the peppers trick is cook it slowly so that we create and we keep the nice colour
all right i've just done the poop shutes and by the look of it they were all slightly worried just before they were captured really they were full up i would be too if something went round my neck wouldn't you
next job for me would you be kind enough to take half that spinach
i'd love to put it in a bowl and then do one part balsamic vinegar behind us to two parts oil
you keep going one part of that two parts oil so for eight weeks
it's all protein that's all i'm eating
the weight just drops off really half a stone in two weeks is mad the idea is to strip the body fat oh wow and then build it back up how does the missus feel about it does she notice the difference in you she's pregnant so when i open the fridge it's my stuff and the other side is chocolate and crisps we don't keep crisps in the fridge but if we did that's where they'd be
all right then it's difficult all the bad foods in the house as well as the good but i'm enjoying it sure i'm really enjoying it have you ever gone on a diet rich have you ever thought about that
i watch what i eat a bit like yourself really i do a lot of running
we can see that can't we eh he's running around the kitchen frantically here that's what happens in kitchens isn't it rich people don't realise how much energy you expel
it sort of burns itself off it's when you eat late of an evening it just holds it and you store it so it's very important to eat just throughout the course of the day and in an ideal world you would eat your main meal at lunch
which bowl large bowl one brought both out wow make a tempora batter i thought you'd do that
my live turkey yeah he had to relegate it to the i've got it i've got it i've got it
god she's god you can't trust her what did you want love what did you want do you want a blender
stick blender don't give her anything she's cheating
get out of it you know what happened last time you were down there go on i've got it is she allowed to do that it's like she's nicked the world cup or something
start whisking in that water there you are mate there you go
with ice cubes we've got eight minutes to go now guys

you've got to have it and you won quite a substantial amount of money yeah half a million dollars half a million dollars ask me what i spent it on half a million dollars so what did you spend it on then i blew it on a racehorse did you did the racehorse do well though it's not it's useless

can we do the yam dance again yeah can do the yam dance
they're trying to get us sloshed aren't they
how's that all right then
very little time left now the music has started one minute it's time to yam up the food
i want you to reduce that get it on the big heap what does that look like coriander is a large leaf
it looks a bit like parsley but smells like coriander
is that it no that's basil smaller the coriander one coriander one that's what we want
coriander coriander there we go come on audience let's see those shoulders
get into the yam dance
ten nine eight seven six five four three two one
let's kick off with the ravioli so we made our own pasta again like we mentioned earlier on it really should have a bit of a resting time so we made the pasta i grilled the prawns no i pan fried the prawns a little bit of olive oil a touch of garlic in there kept them quite natural cos if you've got a good product don't mess around with it too much we made a tomato dressing and the two main herbs in there are chervil which i think will work really well and tarragon olive oil tomato in there as well
it's a bit of an aniseedy type flavour to it isn't it chef and what do you think
i think it's fantastic you can really taste the kick that you get i just spat over you but it doesn't matter you've got to really taste the kick that you get when you mix it about it's just absolutely fantastic
and moving on this one over here so we made that tempura batter
which you mentioned which was the sparkling water ice cubes flour we put a bit of good seasoning in it deep fried the prawns kept them warm and i like warm salads so i warmed up the balsamic vinaigrette so we done olive oil and balsamic warmed that through gently and then put that through the leaves
why warm chef just so it wilts it slightly
if you've got a fresh crisp lettuce you don't have to do that but it brings out the flavour in the spinach sesame seeds and then the spring onions and the prawns on top good andy fantastic
you can taste the wiltness of it
these are grilled so we done pan fried deep fried and grilled sesame seeds red pepper piperade garlic onions olive oil butter little bit of cream red peppers in there all cooked down a bit of lime juice and that creates its own sauce that goes with the jasmine rice we've done the jasmine rice pinch of sugar in there some cardamom pods cloves etc and a little bit of coriander
i love all of it mate i go to their restaurants and their houses
it's going to win it
so we took some bread from our store cupboard it goes to show you can make a pudding out of pretty much nothing eggs cream mixed spice the cashew nuts went through that as well and we also made a cashew brittle so it's nice and moist aerated cos normally bread and butter pudding you cook slowly in a bain marie
you know what yeah i know it's wrong to talk with your mouth full i don't care
let's hear it for andy and richard now what are you doing there les
that's the rest of that beautiful wine that pear wine of yours which is fantastic you make your own wine
you produce your wonderful eggs and stuff like that
i don't lay them the chickens do i know go on pick up your cutlery
it's your turn to have a little bit of a treat i can't wait for this
you'll be better with a spoon actually so you can get the sauce so i can get more in the great thing about this is that it takes on lots of flavours so we've got like a goulash here creamy goulash which is garlic what do you think of that is that lovely the paprika but it's not the hot paprika smoky paprika
straight away that gets your taste buds oh that's wonderful and then break one of these open oh yeah you bought gloucester cheese so we made dumplings
rather than poached dumplings which can be a bit flabby we roasted them in the oven so that was cheese olive oil the flour some herbs and a little bit of salt you've got to have one of these she's off and then just bake them in the oven come back here you she is getting a bit away there come on back go on there we are we like that
that's nicer isn't it isn't it yeah yeah
i've never met such a competitive chef in all my life i know
that is spectacular it really is
peppery rocket with warm broccoli balsamic and tomatoes and basil eggs and then finally the kind of delicious mango and honey cake there you go have a try of that there go on
look at the colour of those eggs as well i know look at the colour of the yolk of those eggs
my sponges have never risen so much now try that so this is the mango and honey cake and it's finished off with that sort of pear and wine you've got good eggs girl good eggs is that yummy
that would be the james baldwin trust lovely fantastic
good to have you here my man thanks very much indeed well done to you too
i'm never going to hear the last of it don't even go there helen
well i used to make flapjack with my friends when they came round and then my friend here her husband's got a bakery and we made it in the bakery and people just came in and wanted more and more
and it just started going a bit crazy didn't it it did and you've got lots of different flavours haven't you
well we've got cranberry flapjack with lemon icing we have pumpkin seed and orange date and molasses we've got cherry and coconut
look at all of these look these are award winning aren't they look at them
they are they've won the best biscuit in the north west
yeah and they've won gold national taste awards two years running and what do they go best with what do you think liz a cup of tea a good cup of tea you can't beat a cup of tea who fancies a cup of tea all of you
yeah yeah with liz's flapjacks
black forest fruits i might stew half of those down and serve those i mean obviously shortbread biscuits that and that just makes me think it's going to be a stack of some sort so then what about a cointreau flapjack and chocolate souffle
ooh
right not much you can say to that really is there i have to say i would go down the more traditional route i would definitely do some sort of walnut and fruit stack with these and then finish the stacks off with warm chocolate sauce just drizzling
ooh
and then i would do it was the way she did that possibly a chocolate mousse as well
come on guys take some of that don't be greedy go on take the plate take the plate oh look at them take the plate down there there we are
put what you don't need in there les and i'll use that
i'm going to make a very very quick crumble
oh i see what's that for lesley
with these fruits which are lovely here there you go darling
thank you do you need the juice you don't really do you no i've created my own juice
i need the juice so i'm going to nick the juice there you go honey are there any spare walnuts there richard of course yeah only need a few do you
don't ask for flapjacks cos they've gone into the audience i noticed they've had them all now what do you think are you enjoying it yes having a good time fantastic i'll keep a few bits to grate on top of that chocolate
absolutely i'm just going to stick a little bit of brown sugar in here maybe this should be a slightly boozy no i tell you what we're going to make custard yeah bit of custard les grand marnier custard so if we can hang on to some of that grand marnier richard are you using grand marnier just a very very small amount all right
and do you want a bit of cream in there too les yeah
so if we can get some cornflour there's a bowl here for you that'll be fantastic so i can separate these
arrowroot or cornflour cornflour it's going to be cloudy isn't it
yes absolutely the arrowroot goes clear doesn't it
and for this instant crumble they smell so beautiful very good
very very good really really good we can see why these are award winning i've got to say they really are very nice indeed
the easiest crumble in the world give him a round of applause fantastic
yes can you pass me some sugar i've got icing sugar here or do you want caster sugar that's fine
icing will be absolutely fine
good afternoon so what would you like to ask our chefs alan we've got some friends coming round on sunday and we've got a large leg of lamb we're just interested to know how you recommend we cook it cooking a large leg of lamb
how much red wine a glass of red wine i'd say half a bottle wow it's going to be a boozy sunday isn't it
and then basically what you want to do is leave it in the fridge overnight and then in the morning when you're ready to cook it if it's a big leg of lamb it will only take about fourteen minutes to cook because you open it out sear it on the top and then roast it in a hot oven gas mark six so take it out of the marinade take it out of the marinade sear it on the top in a roasting tin throw it into the oven with some of the marinade not all of it
two hundred degrees centigrade two hundred degrees celsius
six cook it quite high for probably about thirty five forty minutes make sure you take it out let it rest lift it out of the pan add the rest of the marinade to the juices reduce it down absolutely gorgeous
fantastic thank you very much indeed we have a very quick question from his friend she wants to know about gravy very briefly we're running out of time
i'd like to know how you make a good gravy without gravy granules
you'll have a lot of sediment a lot of good flavour which has come off that the good fats that kind of thing drain off the excess fat then put it back on the heat and get it bubbling away really really nicely so you start scraping those flavours away at that time i'd generally put in a nice sort of a little bit of onion finely chopped onion a little bit of garlic white wine or red wine i like white wine with lamb put the white wine in there about one fifty m. l. and the bottom of that pan should be nice and clean maybe a dusting of flour if you want to go down that route of a quick one if you don't put a good stock on top then reduce it down slowly then right at the last minute put a bit of herb in anything you like rosemary classic example i like thyme sprig of thyme in at the last minute will really freshen it up
hurry up rich i've got ninety seconds to go is that good excellent lovely have a great sunday lunch one and a half minutes to go there we are
i think it's too hot to go into that but i've got to whack it in
i've got a few berries here if you need them les
thank you very much indeed how's it going ains
berries where are the berries got some berries here
well done very very nice stacks
choccy sauce last minute big spoon big spoon there we are i've got one there les
this one here just on the top
ten nine eight seven six five four three two one
stop cooking well done come on come and join us liz lovely how you doing are you all right yep come on then good use of your lovely flapjacks
yes fantastic use yeah go on pick up your cutlery and have a go
this was two thirds of the fruit with a little bit of sugar heated up in a pan the fantastic flapjacks with the chocolate whisked up with a few walnuts fantastic thrown on the top into the oven and that's it and served with the grand marnier custard how's your crumble gorgeous yeah really good and then here's simple chocolate mousse

no she's really close so we need to tidy up we'll help you this time because she's going to be back any moment let's get tidying up get tidying the lounge is tidy but the kids still need to hide matt and mum is just about to arrive
they've hidden matt but mum's coming through the front door
they'll have to leave by the side of the house and quickly
hello i'm back
with matt hidden in the bedroom the kids went back to the van only to be told they had to go right back to the house to win more prizes in puppetry of the parent
so stephanie had to get mum to do an impression of a car dealer which she did
i've got a really nice one out here
becca had to get mum to name two eastenders families which she did
oh the er mitchells yes
and victoria had to get mum to sing the eastenders theme tune
der der der de der
which she did poorly very poorly but they won the prizes but it's never that easy on hider in the house why because matt still needs smuggling out
i thought you weren't going to answer do you need your windows cleaning no i'm fine are you sure i'm from hideyclean i'm very reputable
hideyclean
so who's your regular window cleaner i don't know
what is going on by the way there's a van up there yeah
they're filming what are they filming
aw the distraction isn't working j. k. just can't get her away from the door there's no way the kids and matt can slip behind her
is that the van up there i've just been asking them the same question
no there's filming going on here
right what film you look like you're part of it really
yeah why's that you just do
well if i can't clean your windows i'll try next door but thanks very much cheers see you later on bye
that was an actor i swear that was an actor was it
hang on she's shut the lounge door go go now
this is such a wind up they don't come to the door in overalls
and make up what's going on i've no idea
they did it we got matt out but jk's left mum in a suspicious mood come on in get in come on come on that was brilliant by the way was it easy or dead hard it was easy yeah
let's take a look at what we've all been up to today
today we smuggled matt had a right old run around the garden and met kate then we faced the determinator and went acting with mum we also got her to do some ridiculous things
which meant the kids won four sets of prizes go and get some sleep big day tomorrow a huge day a massive day what are you waiting for off you go to bed night
bye see you in the morning shhh remember be quiet
that's just our cover story while mum is trying her hardest to follow the big kidz recipe matt will be hiding less than one m. away
not only that but he has four scary and very messy tasks to complete
he has to get into his hiding place
it's a scary challenge but if matt can do it they win these puzzles
mummy could you possibly cut
oh no did it get on your finger now that looked easy
that'd go great with jellied eels joel
just grab the cherries and start sprinkling those sorry i spilt something nice one kate
that should keep mum off the scent that's two down two to go yeah this next one is risky
matt has to put some cream on mum
you've got to put the cream on mum
this is a disaster matt is clearly enjoying this but he's still got to put some cream on mum come on this is all going horribly wrong you guys said you were professional chefs
so it looks like you've been hided the kids have told me that you watch the show and you say how can parents be so stupid and not realise let's go in the front room and play her a d. v. d. of what's been going on you probably won't love it
open your eyes lou press play this is what's been happening
mum you thought you were appearing in big kidz when in fact your daughters have been helping me hide in your house for two days

well maybe one day rhys reels in the family's income by doing what he enjoys most
fishing is my life in work i'm a fishing marketing and training officer for the environment agency and the wales tourist board but also outside of work i love to fish and believe it or not i'm actually fishing in the centre of cardiff right now it does give me the opportunity to fish for wild brown trout and grey ling and live very close to the city but i would like to move to the country to enable me to fish in nicer surroundings really in deep valleys and in mountain lakes that would be my love
yeah we've managed to sell um so that's very good news from our point of view
a fair bit about what about eighty yes just over eighty is it eighty five yes eighty five fantastic and i take it you're pretty pleased with that very pleased yes yes definitely so first of all tell me exactly where you'd like to move to
we're looking basically mainly basing around dolgellau an area of mid wales we particularly like
of course the clock is ticking isn't it to get you there
yes because our next baby's due in four months' time
let's make a list of exactly what you need start with the basics how many bedrooms do you need gwyneth
four bedrooms minimum we've got a very small bathroom at the moment so we would ideally like a good family sized bathroom um a bonus would be a utility room or a downstairs bathroom
and rhys you work from home a little bit do you need an office space
um i can work a few days a week from home so it would be important for me to have a space um where i wouldn't be bothered by little children
exactly how much outside space would you like
we're thinking of maybe setting up some sort of self catering holiday let business
right and is there anything else
school um it's important to us to have a school not too far away a welsh speaking school as well so the school must be welsh speaking
yes definitely we want to raise griff and baby number two bilingually brilliant
well i am going to head off now so that i can show you four really good options i might just sneak a little bit out of the borders of your search area so just keep an open mind i know the clock is ticking so um i hope that i will find you the house of your dreams
get searching
my search begins in bont dolgadfan nestled in the cambrian mountains

yes they've done quite a lot of renovation here in the last three years excellent
shall we start through here first
we've got a little sitting room here
i'd like to have an entrance it would be quite nice yes somewhere to put the coats boots
i'd sort of mentally pencilled that this could possibly be an office for rhys yeah who does work from home and on a summer day he can have that open can't he
his little boy can come and bother him all the time
yes i think that's not on the plan actually so there's a shower room next door yes it's very sort of dramatic decoration has this been put in recently in the last three years
good grief play chess on the floor
so we're sort of coming back through the house and have a look upstairs in a minute but we'll continue exploring down here ah so slightly unexpected we've got another bathroom
this is the main bathroom it's nice to have a bath
as well as a shower do you think there'll be one upstairs or they all downstairs i don't know
true but you can also never have too much storage for example
no so we might have to agree to disagree we'll see what my family think
bit funny having two bathrooms next to each other isn't it yes convenient for the plumber and no one else i suppose
ooh finally we've found a living room and it's rather amazing
well this was the main school room of course so that's why they've kept the tall window
yes that's amazing
that's a nice light room it's quite big
so we'll carry on next door oh wow very colourful kitchen it's stunning actually i like the belfast sink and the work tops
room for the table yeah
obviously not a school at the moment so where would my family's children go to the nearest welsh speaking school
it's about three miles and they get picked up with a local taxi

that's just far enough away from the house it's not on the doorstep
it would save us a lot of work
and upstairs we've got four bedrooms the first of which is the master bedroom which is remarkable for two things the first is that you have to be really careful not to concuss yourself on this rather dramatic crossbeam
do you think you'd get underneath the beams that might be a problem
the bed's over there tucked under the slope of the ceiling the other slightly remarkable thing is this little area now on the details it's billed as an en suite bathroom but there's certainly nothing on or sweet about it it's sort of really open plan
you could start sleepwalking and end up in the bath
it's a bit bizarre
next door is bedroom two now that really is fairly tiny but it would be perfect for the new baby and um then in here this is bedroom three now it's actually not a bad size you could squeeze a small double bed in here if you wanted to but it would be perfect for one of the children
that would be a good room for griff wouldn't it yeah
and then finally over this side of the house this is bedroom four and this really is rather dramatic it's got two windows one of them is floor level and then this really pointy roof and it's certainly got character which is one of the things my family were adamant that they wanted
that's nice i prefer that to the other one yeah so make the other a guest bedroom and we'll have this
ysgoldre is a four bedroom rural home with a range of outbuildings its generous plot and separate driveway access offers plenty of scope for rhys and gwyneth's holiday lets idea
there's character and practicality to think of and i think that's got too much character and not enough practicality i like where it's situated yeah very nice position and nice to have the land
lovely kitchen utility room lots of the boxes have been ticked
i've travelled just two and a half miles north to the village of llanbrynmair and i've brought the rainy weather with me it has a shop a pub and a welsh speaking primary school which should please my family and if that wasn't enough it also has a quirky rabbit village i'm pleased to say that my next property has considerably larger dimensions than these glyndwr is a two hundred year old welsh stone house that has had several uses over the years it was originally a farmhouse then a gamekeeper's lodge and for a while it served as the local police station
that's nice oh it is nice
we call it our boot room waterproof floor good for the you know dirty stuff kick off your boots and stuff
plenty of boots as well it's huge isn't it oh yeah
plenty of space there we can put a cupboard in and hooks and things yeah yeah great good start
so um you have got other rooms on this floor yes we've got a room through here oh oh so it's got a very impressive fireplace and not much else is this your solitary contemplation room
when we renovated the house we were looking at possibly doing this into a flat downstairs by knocking through underneath the stairs
we could have the option of making downstairs into a letting unit
yeah right so back across the acres of boot room that's right yes
ooh so gosh we really are right down in the depths of the house here
the house used to be an old police house and this was the cells yeah fishing equipment yes
so this is the start of what you're using as your home
that's correct yeah we're coming into this living area now yeah
oh lovely sitting room
so what's through this door here it's a stable door out to the garden oh right lovely so in the summer you can open this up
absolutely yeah get a nice bit of airflow
that's nice that's very nice to have a garden there
right so we're sort of coming back across your lovely big hallway
yeah the rest of the living accommodation's on this side is it yeah we've got a dining room through this door here
ooh there we are oh i see you've sort of got two doors next to each other there
yeah we have yeah if we want a cosier space we can close that one off if need be
right i see what you mean yeah very nicely presented
this is a really pleasant room you're using it as a dining room
yes we are yeah um so it's sort of semi open plan to your kitchen really yeah on the other side of this rather lovely thing is this an original feature no that came from a barn in south herefordshire yeah so we reclaimed it from there
i thought it was from a barn it's nice i like that effect it like it
um so this would actually work really well because gwyneth really fancies having a kitchen that she can be in but the children can be with her
yeah because you've also got space for your table here absolutely nice clean light looks very tidy there do they actually live there yeah
so it's sort of an l. shape really now what's through here in this room
right through here it's our utility room and boiler room so yeah
oh right excellent
so there's a utility room very good
i think they do live there that's the only place they've had a little bit of clutter
so outside we're at the back of the property here now it's a fairly small garden admittedly although there is quite a big space at the front of the house
i'd be a bit concerned about going into the front room with wellingtons but then they could come in that way yeah great nice
now outside we've got a couple of little stables which i have kind of mentally pencilled might be potential office spaces for rhys but actually having seen them they're pretty tiny there's also a little shed across the way all used to be goat houses but now could be good kayak storage
she obviously hasn't seen the size of my kayak it wouldn't fit
so there are four bedrooms upstairs probably worth pointing out that this is now the second floor so that's two flights of stairs just bear that in mind with small children first room we come to is the family bathroom a fairly decent size room
very clean i like the taps in the middle of the bath
and then across the hallway is the first of the four bedrooms it's a good sized double it's at the back of the house and then next door is what would probably be your guest bedroom and you look out over a little field and then to a river burbling away at the bottom of it so really good fishing inspiration for rhys
do i need inspiration you've just taken the words out of my mouth
rhys doesn't need inspiration for fishing catherine
next up is the smallest of the bedrooms you could actually squeeze a double bed in there but it would be perfect for one of the children but this is the master bedroom so this is a good size room and so the piece de resistance here is that what was the fifth bedroom has been made into an absolutely splendid en suite bathroom so you've got family bathing potential here of the kind that the llywelyns at the moment can only dream of
that is a lovely bathroom it is
it's really nice plenty of room
still to come on escape to the country will rhys and gwyneth pick a ready made home or a diy challenge
a bit pricey um i think there's a lot of work to be done there as well
as they're bowled over by one of my properties
we do like this property there's no two ways about it it's lovely
oh nice big parking area
yeah plenty of outhouses
i like the setting
awesta vaughn has lived in the property since she was a child and is going to show me around we're coming through your back door is that right yes and this lovely big kitchen this is fantastic
lovely i wonder if that takes up most of the ground floor
and how much time do you spend in this room
a lot of time yes most of the time right
and of course you have got other living rooms yes we have yes so let's head off and have a look at those oh now i was going to ask you what you use this room for you've got a desk a three piece suite and a dining table and chairs in here yes
we don't use a lot of it now we used to use it a lot when the kids were small they used to be here and i've a television here
it's a table like ours we can fit ours instead of it that's great
aha so we've finally reached the front door yes we have yes and this is your entrance hall what's in here it's a pantry the old fashioned pantry really
they used to salt pigs and things in there
i'm not going to be salting pigs in there but um no a handy little room
gutting fish in there yeah maybe
and there's the stairs i'll come back to those so now we're right at the far end of the house here yes we are yes ooh in the snooker room yes in the snooker room this is where the grandchildren play
i used it as a playroom
piano
very good so our piano would fit in there because it looks the same kind of style as our piano
and what's through here well that's a lobby oh i see yes it was is this is a partition yes it is i think what you would do is go that way isn't it yes and make one big one big room it would be perfect for the children yes
there wasn't an actual door there there was just a curtain so there's a possibility of making it into one room
so upstairs prepare yourself for the fact it needs a little bit of imagination so first up is a little box room really but there is space for a single bed in there it would be perfect for one of the children
nursery i was going to say hopefully that's the smallest room so that would be the nursery
i think i can safely say that we've got carpets and wallpaper from pretty well every era here um so just think lots of emulsion
that's no problem is it no coat of paint and it'll be a different room
now back at the top of the stairs on the central landing here this little door goes up a rickety little staircase to the attic which runs the entire length of the house so carrying on on this floor the next thing we come to is another single bedroom now as you can see the door actually doesn't particularly open with the bed in there so there is limited room in there
maybe that'll be better for the baby closer to the main bedroom and griff in the other one
and then from here this is the point where you really need to use your imagination because it all becomes very higgledy piggledy now this is slightly odd at some stage this room which probably would be your master bedroom has been partitioned very easy to take that out and you'd end up with a really good size room
that's very strange
i wonder if there's plumbing there we could make it an en suite
now this is where the problems start because you come through here to the other end of the house and the only way you can access this at the moment is through the master bedroom first of all there's a little room through here i'm not entirely what purpose it serves apart from the fact that awista's recently put a shower in
next door this is the only bathroom and of course the only way you can get to it is by coming through the master bedroom
ideally you want to put that bathroom in one of the bedrooms maybe
one of the smaller bedrooms yes
but then again we're having a small bathroom which is something i really was hoping to have a big family bathroom
now one of the real selling points of this property is what lies outside so there's loads of potential first of all there's an old granary on the end which you could incorporate into the living accommodation at the far side of the building there are two stone barns which could potentially be converted and then there's the land now i know rhys and gwyneth will love this situation because the house sits in the middle of its own territory all thirty six acres of it
i just think that it might be worth even buying all the land and then you can you can determine who you want to sell it to then that would be the best way around it maybe
i like the look of this one
it looks nice doesn't it lovely stone
the owner's mother merle fisher has agreed to show me around hello merle hello catherine it's not the best day for it but you've got a lovely little porch to shelter under
very useful before we go inside can we have a look at where all the land is
because there's some woodland isn't there
at the back of house right bluebell wood
no immediate neighbours by the looks of things no
you're kind of overlooking your neighbour down there yeah
right so in we come oh what a lovely wide hallway merle
yes so you've got your staircase there obviously but what's in here first of all right that's a sitting room cum library
love the bookshelves it's a really good size but there's another sitting room isn't there yes
two sitting rooms so one could be an office or one could be a playroom a playroom
so this is the dining room amazing walls i noticed these in the hallway they're throughout the house are they yes
that's nice another fireplace there
seeing the patio doors in the summer that you could open them out yes oh yes excellent well let's carry on through what's the room here through here oh now this is a very good size room one of gwyneth's requirements is that she can have a kitchen that she can spend time with the family in
it's a good size kitchen isn't it
yeah nice and airy as well
yeah lovely very good
we're back into the centre of the house here yes so this goes towards the back
uh huh it's a lovely spacious hallway what have we got in here well just under the stairs for ironing board etcetera
definitely it's a bonus to have a toilet downstairs
yeah bathroom even better great
right ooh so now we've got beams in here
yes we're very fortunate the rooms are so high
yes because you've got the character but not the head banging potential
i really like that
nice fireplace nice wooden floor stonework
now there aren't any existing outbuildings with this property and although there's quite a big garden part of it is on a fairly steep bank here
it's got possibilities though it has yes it's got a bit of land there
so there's a lovely old wooden staircase that was preserved from the house there are five bedrooms altogether this is the first of them it's actually a really pleasant room
that's nice lovely lots of head room there isn't there
yeah again there's two windows
lots of light i like that
this is the smallest of the bedrooms definitely a single or as you can see they've got bunk beds and then this is billed as a suite of rooms so this is the upstairs bathroom although it hasn't actually got a bath in it just a shower but it's still a very good size really nicely fitted this was sort of deemed to be a dressing room although the current owners are using it as a study
it leads through into a bedroom which you would think would be the master suite but actually this isn't the biggest of the bedrooms it's actually quite small and it has a sloping ceiling so it's a bit restricted on the head height
that would be nice whether you could sort of let that as a unit i don't know whether there's access to it independent access to just those three rooms because you'd have the bathroom the bedroom and another room
so this is now the fourth bedroom and it's a really good size great head height no worries about banging your head on the ceiling here this property really does seem to go on and on it's like a sort of rambling warren of rooms so that's your fourth bedroom then you've got another little corridor and if you go down here and round the corner you finally come to the fifth bedroom which is currently being used as a treatment room for an acupuncture business it's a really good size and i think i would be inclined to use this as the master bedroom because it's certainly the most impressive of the five
that's huge that is fantastic look you've got windows in windows in the roof and in the walls roof i was thinking in welsh then i couldn't think of the word and the walls fantastic double bed in there ample
let's have a look at what we've seen already
ysgoldre in bont dolgadfan i liked the land the amount of land it had i thought that was great and but i didn't particularly like the property to be honest
i don't particularly like the look of it from the outside
initially i liked this one looks lovely from the outside
but it's in the village that's the only thing we're not really looking to live in the village really no land either
no land no the garden's small isn't it
exactly no no
y. r. allt i liked the feel of this one the location looked good
i like this one i must say i'd like to see it i think that's a definite yes and plas rhiwgwreiddyn the last one
i like this one i like this one i think the inside is fantastic it's got a lovely look to it inside and out
i'm not sure about this land though it looks a bit steep and heavily wooded
i feel it's definitely us
yes it's a yes so it will be plas rhiwgwreiddyn and y. r. allt mallwyd those are the ones definitely
today they're off to see their first property in mallwyd hi rhys hi gwyneth hi hello welcome to the first property first things first what do you think of the location
the views are fantastic all the mountains in the background it's really nice
the house is obviously the most important what do you think from the outside
i like the stonework it's traditional yeah traditional farmhouse feel it's really nice
so let's get inside and start having a look around so you've got this little scullery entrance first this is the back door that we've come in through yeah and then straight into the kitchen
big kitchen it's a good size
i do like the size of it and the fact that it's a family room isn't it yeah the children could be here playing it's nice to have a rayburn keep it nice and warm yes
yes this is a nice feature isn't it nice impact when you walk in have you cooked on one of these gwyneth my mother's got one ah right so you'll be fine and everything's sort of on a long thin layout so we come through here this is your sitting room here's your proper flooring under there
i really like the flooring definite
and the superb big beam here
yes wonderful our dresser would go there maybe
yes i think it might even cope with the height of our dresser yes it wouldn't be far off
so as we go through here now we're coming into the sort of the central hallway and this well this isn't any sort of room at the moment it's a sort of a dumping room and a piano playing room
our piano would go here anyway
yes
needs some needs some tuning this one
every room because it's all sort of laid out along this side looks out onto those fantastic views
yeah yeah stunning
this is a good size
this is the master bedroom then yeah
yes obviously
and this this will come down pretty easily i think
so that would give us more space thataway that would be a good size bedroom wouldn't it yeah i have to watch my head on the beam though this is great attic space here you going to follow me in here yeah
oh this is nice we could do a lot with this room couldn't we probably have to take these slates off again and re line it and re insulate it to get it weatherproof yeah but there's potential here definitely
oh yeah great potential but i'm just beginning to get a bit concerned now is it too much for us with the baby round the corner
hello hi hiya you're popping out of the front door so you've seen the whole thing how are you feeling about it at this stage
i really love the fact that it's got so much land it's a real bonus
great potential but a lot to think about
it's a major project isn't it
it is a major project so we're looking forward to seeing the next property now yes
it does it really looks lovely from the outside
oh that's lovely really nice
yeah very nice isn't it
wood is lovely as well really nice the staircase
yes we haven't even we're only in the hallway let's go through here while the going's good this is the dining room
doors out yes we can open them and walk out can't we
yeah
do you like it as it's been done
yes yeah i quite like the strong colours it's nice to have a dramatic colour this is nice isn't it plenty of height
yeah now you're really adamant that you wanted a proper heart of the home kitchen
is this fulfilling it gwyneth
yes i think it's a nice feel to it it's lovely
what do you think of it rhys
i actually think it's a little bit dark in here um i don't know why it's so dark it's probably just the paintwork a lick of paint might do it but it's surprising with all the windows
let's go back across the hallway
this is absolutely lovely nice spacious hallway as well isn't it yes everything about it down here is nice
very good all the little touches like the wood on there in the corner
space for a piano hey oh look here's a black cat crossing our path must be a good sign
good sign very good sign
oh this is lovely oh wow isn't it yeah very nice there's a grown up sitting room feel to this one yeah in the evening children in bed lounging it's lovely
yeah let's lock it when the kids are around i think yeah no entry for the children
so is there anything that you would change or do you pretty much like it as it is so i mean to let the two of you go and explore but what are your feelings about the house from what you've seen so far
we like it yeah we definitely like the house the location does worry me though i must admit
wow look at this
that's what you call a master bedroom this is stunning isn't it yeah mind you oh no you do clear it i clear this i clear this very easily well that yeah lovely beam we'd have the bed here
yeah definitely there's plenty of room isn't there yeah really high ceilings as well
yeah it's lovely listen to the rain though
i just don't think log cabins would work up here it's a bit too steep you know
and they'd be looking down on us on our home yeah we'd lose that aspect of privacy
yeah not far enough away from the house i don't think it's child friendly either is it you know
no we'd be in casualty more often than home i think
so you've seen two very different options option number one lots of hard work option number two ready made house are you going to be making an offer on either of them
not at this stage one don't think no number one we thought was too much work to be honest
now i would have put good money on the fact that you'd fall in love with this property
we do like this property there's no two ways about it it's lovely so why not this one the location it does rain here all the time to be honest
so obviously no offers today but is there anything that you're taking away from the experience of our search together is there anything that you've learned yeah definitely
i think what we one big thing that we've learned is that it's not just the property that we're looking for it's the property and the location those two things together would make the perfect place for us
and also there aren't that many properties available
don't be downhearted and do keep on searching i have learned that i should never get over excited about a property before i've checked the local weather conditions and i've also learned a bit of welsh which i've been practising to say to you pob lwc diolch catherine in case you didn't quite get my accent i'm just trying to say best of luck i really hope you find somewhere and that your baby gets to grow up in the countryside rather than in cardiff so do keep me keep me posted as to where you end up and i'll pass by and have a bit of an england wales line up
yeah why not wales will win
they still believe there are children somehow surviving underneath this rubble that's why the relief effort is going to continue until every parent we'll show
body parents have to identify their children this father has just found out that his son his only child has died he can barely stand parents asking why this building didn't survive the quake our son was wonderful says this mother l. would like to kill those responsible the man says the last time anyone found someone alive under the wreckage of the school was this morning they still believe there are children somehow surviving underneath this rubble that's why the relief effort is going to continue until every parent finds out what happened to his or her child this town has now lost its next generation right now it feels like it has lost its future as well amidst those harrowing scenes every now and then there are successes a life saved against all the odds the army is leading a huge rescue operation and as we have heard it is under orders not to give up today that determination has saved one young woman dan griffiths has her story another day in the disaster zone and another extraordinary rescue at first only a hand is visible then a face this young woman has spent three days underground praying for a miracle and now it has come i tried shouting for help she says but when none came i kept quiet to conserve energy she has escaped death by millimetres very slowly she is pulled out her eyes are covered as she is blinded by the sunlight she's one survivor amid the definite straition three days in and some areas are still only just being reached these are some of the first pictures from the earthquake's epicentre some say there are several thousand people missing in this area alone the living are massively outnumbered by the dead china's vast search and rescue operation is in full swing here the only way in is from the air these paratroopers have been sent in to help with communications today came news from some of the british survivors they gave their items accounts after being cared for by local villagers
suddenly we had this horrendous noise where you can't describe what it is like it is a huge huge noise and the land shaking underneath you
looks like in the week people coming here after work and enjoying the sunshine last night it turned into a battlefield even now you can smell beer and urine in this part of the city there are even blood stains even the police say they their strategic planning could not have prevented what happened last night
approach to public drinking some fans have blamed that policy for what happened here
most of the other one hundred thousand had been drinking as well and didn't cause any problems i walked down from the ground after the game surrounded by disappointed rangers fans and they were in good humour and still enjoying the atmosphere l. don't think you can put alcohol down to this these were hooligans having in an unacceptable way
turned into a public toilet everything was trashed here they
i've counted one hundred seven and now i've lost the count of the bodies that we have passed they are everyone along the banks of the river more terrifying than seeing that is to think about what is happening with the survivors tens of thousands of people stranded in villages alongside this river and getting no help at all
laboratory it goes into details of how chambers managed to cheat his way into to the top look at thg a drug a balco specialist they describe how thirty units of the liquid was placed under his tongue on a monday and wednesday it was an incredible description of how he evaded detection
is this letter and the contents going to help catch drug cheats in the future he
if i did not have these hours i would still be on benefits and doing nothing but now i can come to work and have time
any mandatory rulings from parliament are a joke when it comes to telling employers what they have to do to accommodate employees because they say you don't have to do it but have you ever tried saline no two and employed the it is worse than having children tried saline no to an employee you for ninety per cent of requests are agreed
in the past we haven't seen girls significantly involved in crime recently we have and stealing things like cosmetics and make up and it seems a terrible waste for young people to enter the criminal justice system get a record for stealing things like that
what we might once have called mr. geoff today we label crime mischief a cat fight between schoolgirls saw this girl convicted of common assault aged fifteen in another it day she might have got detention these
if you bring children into a more formalised youth justice system it is harder to get them out so if we don't want to see girls feeding through later it is best to divert them at an early age especially for offences that are not serious that could be dealt with in other ways perhaps
here i can't believe he is dead
he is the world champion
so far so good
are you exhausted
one to go over the top however i will finish i am going to finish to prove to those who doubted me that i can achieve it
actions he has taken since then to repay his debt to society have been admirable and it is great to meet a young man like that
it is an unprecedented situation and our company has been working in russia for more than fifteen years and it is the first time we have had to hire
the prices are hitting the route hitting growth even the rolling stones and madonna cannot sell tickets more expensive than people are asking for tickets for this final
together they make up the eggheads arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country the question is can they be beaten welcome to eggheads where five quiz challengers pit their wits against possibly the greatest quiz team in britain you might recognise them they've won some of the country's toughest quiz shows they are the eggheads and challenging our resident quiz champions today are sink the bismark from surrey for many years the team all worked at the same it company and still regularly quiz together let's meet them hi i'm paul i'm sixty four and i'm a retired it consultant
hi i'm john i'm fifty seven and i'm a retired computer services manager
hi i'm alan i'm sixty and i'm a retired it management consultant
hi i'm andrew i'm fifty three and i'm a business development manager
hi i'm peter i'm fifty four and i'm an it solutions manager
welcome sink the bismark i like the team name tell me how you acquired it it's a film a war film isn't it sink the bismarck yes it is we
it was devised by my fellow team mates as a permanent reminder to me not to invent silly stupid answers in pub quizzes i did that once and we lost the quiz and the silly stupid answer was sink the bismarck
can you remember the question oh no it was about sport or something
it may well have been probably was
it's one of those isn't it you just throw it out there one of these memorable film titles would have been a hero if you'd been right absolutely yes every day there's one thousand worth of cash up for grabs for our challengers however if they fail to defeat the eggheads the money rolls over to the next show so sink the bismark the eggheads have won just the last game which means two thousand says you can't beat the eggheads eggheads who was in sink the bismarck kenneth moore kenneth moore kenneth moore dana wynter he was admiral or something he was captain shepard
director of naval operations
typical isn't it they know all about it there we are and how was the bismarck sunk then torpedoed
torpedoed from h. m. s. gloucestershire set on fire and rolled over and sank
who went for politics it wasn't me it was you it'll be andy i shall i shall take that on
like the hand up andrew clearly identified which egghead would you like to take on
don't read out my statistics hold on the last time
you told me not to because it put a hex on you you won
i know but i had to really battle at it
thank you andrew would you like to go first or second
i'll go first please dermot
well i remember this period very well it seems like yesterday of course it was arthur scargill
arthur scargill yes that's correct well done certainly not ian macgregor who was on the other side wasn't he judith first question to you who was the only woman in the so called gang of four who left the labour party and launched the s. d. p. in nineteen eighty one
well it wasn't barbara castle or clare short cos they're staunch labourites but it was shirley williams
shirley williams yes that's right one of the gang of four one all andrew second question from nineteen ninety nine to two thousand three who was the first presiding officer of the scottish parliament
right this is quite a difficult question nineteen ninety nine to two thousand three presiding officer well i can't remember exactly when the scottish parliament was formed but i'm guessing that alex salmond and charles kennedy were regular m. p.'s still then whereas i think david steel had moved on so i suspect it's david steel but it's a slightly educated guess
well it definitely wasn't kensington and chelsea erm i think it's oh dear this is something i've missed i think it's more likely to be huntingdon than anything else
right well harold macmillan was the conservative prime minister so it's certainly wasn't him it's either nye bevan or hugh gaitskell i think a little sort of tic in my memory i think it was nye bevan
yes
well you're not going naked into the final round fully armed with a formidable brain andrew well done you have beaten judith i should have read your statistics out judith
no whatever you do i don't think it would've made any difference
great round by andrew means you play in the final round you won't judith would you both please come back and join your teams sink the bismark the eggheads far from holed below the waterline but a nice hit they've lost one brain from the final round you're all there let's have another head to head then this one is going to be arts and books who'd like to play can't be andrew one of the others martin john
the eggheads it can't be judith
i'll go first please dermot
trying to follow andrew to the final round arts and books in the early years of the twentieth century which painter had a blue period and a rose period in the early years of the twentieth century which painter had a blue period and a rose period
well i haven't heard of the rose period but i think i've heard of the blue period and that would be picasso
um i think those are for female writers
you remember i told you a couple of days ago i'd gone through a quiz book and selected questions i liked
yeah this was one of them
it's from la boheme
is that a scientific way of learning questions you like
it's the one i find works best i go through a quiz book select questions i think have a chance of coming up or i think are interesting and i make a note of them
and hopefully remember them
that does help yeah
yeah we frisk you before you go into the question room no writing up the arm there la boheme yes your tiny hand is frozen features in la boheme you have the lead and it means john you've got to get this towards the end of his life robert louis stevenson went to live in the south seas dying in one thousand eight hundred ninety four on one of the islands in which group towards the end of his life robert louis stevenson went to live in the south seas dying in one thousand eight hundred ninety four on one of the islands in which group
ah well i'm afraid this is also gonna have to be a bit of a guess robert louis stevenson was scottish may have gone to somewhere with a scottish association so on that basis not hawaii samoa or fiji i will plump for fiji
western samoa
western samoa he was known as tusitala by the natives what did that mean
right well it's all square now in terms of those head to heads one brain missing from each team so far our next subject now is sport who'd like to play this from paul alan or peter it's me isn't it sporting peter who do you think you've got a sporting chance of beating from the eggheads from chris daphne or kevin
daphne or i think it'll be daphne yes i think it was daphne
daphne we're all agreed on that let's have peter and daphne into the question room then please and the round then is sport peter now which way do you want to play it both andrew and john started off success for andrew not so for john what do you think you're gonna do peter i think
i'll carry on going first dermot
hook shots lay ups and rebounds are all in basketball rebounds yeah i suppose yes you can have a rebound in ice hockey but basketball so a chance for the lead for daphne with her first question the british athlete steve cram became world champion over which distance in nineteen eighty three
oh he was a fifteen hundred metres runner and he was lovely to look at as well all that blond hair
now a successful commentator it's the right answer yes fifteen hundred metres for steve cram world champion in nineteen eighty three
never olympic champion though never olympic champion he never won an olympic gold it's the way the years fall isn't it
when you're at your best in eighty three olympics what eighty four presumably he took part in the eighty four olympics
yeah it was still the heyday of coe so
i seem to remember there was a fuss about this when this happened i think it was from leeds united that he left i'll go for leeds
yes it was interesting wasn't it cos everyone expected nadal to play federer but instead it was djokovic who won it
it was yes djokovic who did he play in the final
well i have no idea on this one at all this is going to have to be a complete and utter guess and i will guess dean richards
deano it's the right answer yes dean richards presumably after winning it and perhaps some celebrations i would guess involving the cup
over enthusiastic celebration
what year was it again nineteen ninety four um i'm not sure but i've just got a feeling that it was devon malcolm
what a feeling it's the right answer yes devon malcolm is correct warned the south africans they were history so often it doesn't happen that your prophecies come true but he did it yes nineteen fifty seven so daphne you're through to the final round bad luck peter got going too late that slip up at the first hurdle has cost you a place in the final round please come back and join your teams after a storming start sink the bismark beginning to slip a bit but you can even it up in the final round with our last head to head this one is entertainment and the remaining players are paul or alan
it's you would you like entertainment then no
it's gonna be you alan and who from the eggheads would you like to play it's kevin or chris
who shall we go for
it's gonna be chris we're gonna go for chris
as my other team mates i'll go first please dermot
best of luck alan who played the role of margot leadbetter in the t. v. sitcom the good life
right well it certainly wasn't alison steadman felicity kendal was in the good life but she was actually the one leading the good life and her neighbour was margot penelope keith is my answer
and it's the correct one yes good start alan
she's also the former high sheriff of surrey
yeah that's the sound of music dermot
the sound of music is correct alan second question for you chasing pavements was a u. k. top ten hit single in two thousand eight for which singer chasing pavements was a u. k. top ten hit single in two thousand eight for which singer
well i know the song dermot i've got the melody in my mind but i can't think now who sung it so it's gonna end up being a bit of a guess and i think my guess is going to be kate nash
well twin peaks was really pretty weird wasn't it and the one that specialises in weird stuff is david lynch so that's my answer so that's your analysis it was weird he's a bit weird
and it's the right answer yes david lynch two to you so you've got to get this alan who directed three of the first four james bond films who directed three of the first four james bond films
well one of the first four must have been doctor no and i'm afraid none of those names are actually familiar to me associated with doctor no so again i'm afraid this is going to have to be a guess and i'm going to guess for lewis gilbert
lewis gilbert did he direct three out of four of the first four james bond films he didn't it's terence young terence young directed let's egghead this then what are the first four what are the three he directed
the first four we know do we doctor no from russia with love goldfinger
and thunderball
three out of the first four presumably thunderball but not goldfinger
guy hamilton directed goldfinger there we are they've all directed more than one
which bond films did lewis gilbert direct
the spy who loved me and probably moonraker amazing stuff there
yes stay with our tactic it hasn't worked so far but you never know
i've never heard of the b. one
are you sure you've been paying attention when you've been reloading the photocopier oh dear you're right
he's a little tease isn't he
just a tad a five is correct yeah
the bulwarks dermot
got to be careful how you say that haven't you i know it is the right answer yes the bulwarks correct back to you sink the bismark in which year was the radio show desert island discs first transmitted in which year was the radio show desert island discs first transmitted
it wasn't eighty two it wasn't eighty two no it was very early wasn't it it was roy plumley wasn't it yes for many many years
i think it was i think it was roy plumley that was originally that originated the programme and i think it was going for quite some time so i think nineteen forty two is the answer
it's a pomander
you went for pomander does it work daphne
i don't know you know who needs that
have you tried it have you tried it out
no no what mothballs then for you is it no no no no moths in my house we've got cats
daphne has enough success with her formaldehyde
well i really don't know the answer to this but i think i've heard of
something called a florentine ducat but by might have got that completely wrong but that's
i was trying to think if there was any connection between ducat and one of the titles of one of the the doge of venice perhaps it's not much like ducat though i've got no real feel at all we'll go with your one i think shall we go with that
we don't know the answer but we're going to go with florence
it's they're called marilyns
why
anatomical reasons i think
marilyn monroe
they return to london they might not be having a victory parade move over beano as the first comic in twenty five years comes to the capital good evening the metropolitan police commissioner has told this programme that parents need to play their part in tackling teenage gun and knife crime it comes days after b. b. c. london revealed that seventy people under the age of twenty five have been murdered in less than eighteen months making the situation far worse than first thought sir ian was speaking as the new stop and search crackdown on weapons continued today i'm here in suffolk which has one of the highest knife crime rates in the capital the met says youth murders are a top priority second only to terrorism i was talking to the commissioner on the first indepth meeting on the issue l. asked him was there a crisis he denied that l. asked him was it out of control
no i don't think it's out of control this is city with eight million people but it has got to be kept in control we can't be in a position in which murder after murder occurs wr with no apparent linkage sometimes there are occasional gang linkages but this is random
aren't you playing to the gallery
we have enormous community support here we have people from the stop and search monitoring group who are really supportive with this we have one hundred fifty of the officers we'll use them in this method to make sure people realise they can't carry a knife
the deputy mayor of london was describing london as becoming the
that young black males that they will be targeted
it is an interesting thing in the machine behind us it is arbitrary it is whoever walks through it but we have to recognise in talking to the black community in london that the victims of the stabbings and shootings are disproportionately from one community
coming down
not for young people
wait the proportion of young people in that has been rising that's why we're doing something about it there are millions of young people under twenty five in this city every single death is too many you can have random patterns of it we have had two or three in the last days we have had six weeks without any we have to find every method to stop this happening
so the commissioner there insisting that there's no crisis and crime is falling is that going to reassure people do you think
some people doubt that stop and search will work and others think what you have seen here the elephant and amp castle the metal detecting arches are a gimmick l. asked the commissioner if he felt his job was on the line if the murders did not come down he said absolutely not burglaries and crime have fall all fallen

the fight goes on fourteen of the country's top chefs are battling for the chance to prove that britain can produce fine cutting edge cooking the winners will serve up a glorious banquet in the restaurant at the summit of the iconic gherkin in central london the cooking will have to be superb because hosting that meal will be our leading culinary trailblazer heston blumenthal and his guest list will include leading chefs and gourmets from all over the world wrestling for position this week to represent london and the south east in our finals are atul kochhar and jason atherton
i'm fighting my own corner and i'm very happy with that and very comfortable
i'm sure he's gonna bring his a game today so i'm gonna have to turn it up a notch
this week michelin starred chefs jason atherton and atul kochhar are sparring for the london and south east regional title both are influenced by styles and ingredients from other countries but they're emphatic that their food is modern british their methods may differ but their aim is the same to design the ultimate twenty first century four course meal every day they're cooking a different course and their full menus will be scrutinised by the judges tomorrow their exacting standards mean that only the best modern food will make it through to heston blumenthal's glittering banquet next month the chance to cook some of the world's finest chefs and gourmets is a powerful motivation atul and jason are limbering up for the penultimate round of the fight good friends out of the kitchen today they'll cook their last course before judgement day and it's time to get tough
it's just an obstacle if you want to be successful in life you can't be friends all the time
i've definitely come here to win in that kitchen i'll be as competitive as he can be
it's a trip back in time as jason puts a modern twist on the seventies classic arctic roll he's serving it with a raspberry salad and is using sarawak peppercorns to bring a piquancy to his raspberry jelly and he's boldly taking on atul at his own game by using spices in a dessert
you're inspired by me are you
for three days i've watched you with your little pots of spices i know i've been going to sleep at night drifting off to these exotic lands and i just thought i better get my act together and get some spice in or i'm gonna totally get my ass kicked
my one's slightly simpler than yours it's green cardomom and lime panna cotta using proper english cream and top it off with strawberry jelly really really cool cream and strawberries summertime that's my thing and i'll be doing a strawberry sorbet with that yeah and baking a shortbread biscuit and a strawberry powder with dried strawberries
atul's dessert is a cardomom and lime panna cotta topped with strawberry jelly there are more strawberries in the sorbet on top of his shortbread biscuits and in the strawberry powder
very simple compared to you it sounds very posh it's not very simple atul not at all
dehydrated strawberries are not simple
so jason thinks his rival's dessert could be complicated but atul's confident about its simplicity he's worked hard on his dessert and he's definitely a chef who does his food research properly atul kochhar has been chef patron of london's benares restaurant and bar for five years his british indian eatery is highly respected for its originality and determined to stay at the top of his game atul regularly checks out any possible competition
when i walk into any restaurant my experience starts from the moment i step in how it's been decored how the tables are laid out what sort of crockery they have but the main important thing comes when the food starts coming out fantastic what sort of lamb shank is this it's from the lucknow region wow it's super i like to learn how they are using spices i might saute spices in one way but there might be a way to bring flavour out by steaming them or boiling them in the sauce and that's the only reason i come out and learn more
after years of seeing how other people do it and successfully running his own business he's recently decided to branch out and open another venue but this time it's not in mayfair he's set his heart on a place in the hampshire countryside surrounded by an award winning vineyard today he's brought his wife and children to look around the new venture battica
the hampshire restaurant will mark a shift to be honest in a lot of ways i'll be able to use the local farmer who will grow vegetables for me just across the street the beef farmer is just down the road the poultry farmer is just behind us so everything is absolutely local for me i'm really looking forward to get there this is the restaurant inside
atul will soon be entertaining a different clientele but will he adopt a new style or stay true to his roots
i was born in india and my children are born here in this country so we are a british indian family and that's the kind of food i cook i'm hoping by doing this restaurant it will be something which my children will appreciate and grow with it and understand what british indian values mean
back in our kitchen the chefs are well under way with their dessert courses competition veteran atul has won the regional title for two years in a row now but it's not getting any easier
this is the toughest in what sense competing against you is not easy mate come on i'm the only one who is standing here if anybody else were here they'd have run away before the competition you're so good
that's not true it's true you're just flattering me i'm not
jason's playing the modesty card but atul has every reason to praise his opponent jason atherton is the executive chef of the modern british tapas restaurant maze in london he has considerable international experience and is undoubtedly devoted to the job
i'm very driven as a chef no two ways about that for me it's my life it's what i do i live breathe eat sleep food and i think it shows in everything i do
his boss gordon ramsay noticed jason's potential early
the first real quality i admired of jason atherton was his drive to succeed jason's developed over the last four or five years more than any other chef i know he's in a league of his own unique very stubborn in terms of that level of focus and unaffected by his popularity
my family is obviously a big part of my life because they play second fiddle almost in a work sense to my work so it's terribly important to me for my family to be passionate about food because it's my life it's what i live for
and even at home he's still taking on new culinary influences
my wife is from the philippines so we cook and eat a lot of asian food not just from the philippines but all southeast asian food which is really vibrant fresh ingredients she's opened my eyes to that part of the world
back in the great british menu kitchen the chefs are putting all their skill and energy into their dessert courses it's their last chance to perfect the dishes before judgement day tomorrow jason's raspberry jelly infused with sarawak pepper is being reduced and now he's tackling the ice cream for his arctic roll he's combining double cream and milk with vanilla on the other side atul starts off his panna cotta with a mixture of cream and castor sugar he's already ground his green cardomom pods and his opponent's intrigued
so i toasted it lightly the cardomom pods
wow it's much stronger yeah it is all the flavour just comes out
and it works so well with vanilla almost toffee like feeling mm
that's really good and you just infuse it into the milk right
into the milk straight
yeah that's it this'll just cook together and i'll add gelatine to it
jason's impressed he knows that atul's dessert could be serious competition he returns to his own side to add egg yolks to the vanilla ice cream but his mind is still on atul's pud
which cream do you use now atul do you prefer organic or normal cream i prefer organic
i do prefer organic the kind of person i am i'm a holistic person i like nice things you're organic yourself are you i find organic cream tastes better in my opinion
atul knows that this heat could be very close and that the dessert could decide it so before the competition began he set out in search of expert advice his panna cotta is an italian inspired dessert but he didn't have to jet out to rome or milan he took a trip to kensington just three miles from his london restaurant he wanted to give his dessert a modern interpretation using exotic flavours so he went to meet a renowned italian pudding maker
i love panna cotta because of its double cream content it's lovely good for your body isn't it so i decided to make that for my great british menu judges and obviously i need to beat my dear friend
atul had brought some double cream with him but was luciano prepared to use it in an italian dessert
some of the best english cream you can get in this country from jersey cows i would say it's organic it's double cream it's fantastic have you cooked with this cream before
i usually use normal double cream from italy but i guess this one is going to be better
atul found cream that was not only british but came from the south east too from wilden in bedfordshire crowhill farm has over three hundred cows and the dairy produces an average of twenty five thousand litres of milk cream and yoghurt every day
the quality of the cream is just out of this world i could never believe i could get such a cream just a stone's throw from london so i really don't care what jason atherton is cooking for his dessert i know this cream is a winner
in luciano's kitchen the double cream was heated with milk gelatine and castor sugar
the cream looks amazing to me
luciano agreed and having put the cooled mixture into the fridge for two hours invited atul to taste some of his own confections
saffron saffron from italia this is really nice i love this one this is fantastic that's my favourite
but he wanted to create his own modern interpretation of panna cotta for great british menu
it has got my mind going i need to think about what flavours to add to it saffron i think was the catalyst i'm thinking of black cardomom maybe green cardomom maybe white cardomom i don't know i'll go back and think about it before i submit my recipes but panna cotta is on my menu
and his of course will be made with english double cream the batch they'd made earlier was ready to taste
this is perfect luciano this is perfect perfect for me perfect british cream italian recipe indian man making it where else you can get that only in london only in london
back in the great british menu kitchen both dessert courses are proceeding apace after much thought atul has decided on a flavouring of lime and green cardamom a quick sprinkle of lime zest is all it needs before it goes into the fridge that sounds easy but it's very runny
careful
one little slip and they'll be panna cotta mixture all over the floor
perfect
still to come on great british menu atul reveals a secret
it's true it's not a rumour it's a fact
but what is it the chefs give their honest opinions as they taste one another's' dishes so far everything seems to be going to plan with the two very posh puds atul's aiming to impress with a cardamom and lime panna cotta strawberry sorbet and shortbread biscuits they'll be yet more strawberries in a jelly on the panna cotta and sprinkled on the biscuits
i have picked up on summer and i thought of cream and strawberries they go well together jelly you can't leave jelly especially for british summer i've used all those elements
jason's also going for a dessert that's modern but in a retro way he's bringing arctic roll back into fashion accompanied by a raspberry and sarawak pepper jelly it's finished off with a pretty raspberry salad but can this seventies children's choice be classed as a british classic
that's exactly what is a great british dish it's had a bit of a stigma attached to it where it's only been used as something you can give to the kids to keep them quiet but i'm here to show people that it's not like that not at all it can be a serious dessert
he'll need to execute it perfectly though he already has his ice cream churning and his sponge is nearly ready but he's a bit concerned about how the judges will react to being served with two desserts that are both based on cream and summer fruits
will they make much of this both using the same ingredient
no i don't think so they have very clean palate all of them
see they know you atul so you're three steps ahead of me
yeah it's easy to fall down from there
i'm so up against it it's unbelievable
jason isn't really intimidated but atul's experience may give him a slight edge he's now adding liquid glucose to his sorbet while jason works on the jam for his arctic roll now i'd just open the cupboard but he wanted something special so he went out to find top quality ingredients and some hot tips london's markets are like a treasure trove of fresh fruit so there was plenty to choose from after scouring new covent garden jason settled on some juicy raspberries but needed help to turn them into top quality jam fraser doherty may only be eighteen but he already runs his own successful company he's one of the youngest businessmen in the u. k. to supply major supermarkets and has even received a business award from gordon brown jason was keen to see how he approaches jam making
i'm making arctic roll remember that yeah i love arctic roll i'm making that and i'm taking it to the twenty first century show these judges what a great british dessert can be i tasted your jam about a year ago now around the corner it was really really delicious and what i really liked about it was it was not over sweet
i think it's gonna be a really fruity tart taste now because of the cranberries and the raspberries so i think it'll work really well
the recipe where's it from
my gran taught me how to make jam when i was fourteen and i started doing it as a hobby i liked making jam and developed the idea of making jam completely from a fruit and fruit juice over a few years and some supermarkets have taken it on
the first stage was to heat up sweet grape juice until it bubbled furiously
what density are we looking for
quite a syrupy density so about a quarter of its original volume
right quarter of its volume
fraser suggested that they also put in one of his secret ingredients
i've never used cranberries in raspberry jam especially for arctic rolls for me it's a bit of a new invention
he had one more thing to add
i'm gonna put some of the raspberries into this pan
you cooking them down or just heating them up
so far so good but setting jam's the tricky bit that's all about temperature
i'll boil it up to the setting point about one hundred five degrees
right and then that will hopefully set right we can try
it cools and gels quickly on a cold plate
back in the great british menu kitchen jason has decided on his own secret flavouring adding lemon thyme to a concentrated raspberry jam base
the way it needs to look it needs to have a dense layer around the outside for the ice cream will it be ready in time atul i'm always on time
now that sounds like tempting fate atul needs to concentrate on the next stage of his dessert a layer of strawberry jelly on top of his now set panna cotta on the other side of the kitchen jason's spreading the sponge mixture for his arctic roll but he's worried that all his efforts today will be wasted on his rival
atul i've heard a rumour that you don't like eating desserts is that true
it's true it's not a rumour it's a fact
how are you gonna critique my dessert if you don't like desserts
that's your problem mate
huh that's your problem it's not my problem i love desserts i'll give yours a fair crack of the whip course it matters it matters to me atul
spoken like a true friend but if atul doesn't like desserts he'd find it hard to comment on one he doesn't know anything about
what's british about arctic roll then
there's nowhere else in the world they serve it it's not like
not even in the arctic
no not in the arctic no when you think about it atul it is very traditional british and it's more traditional than panna cotta no
i agree i never argued that but panna cotta is still very british especially the cardamom and lime one
with atul revamping a traditional italian dessert and jason attempting to overhaul an old british classic both chefs may have their work cut out convincing the judges that their dishes represent our very best contemporary desserts
what do you hate about modern british
to have a cuisine which has turned into modern british you've got to look at how long the association has been where it has come from there has to be some credibility you cannot have a restaurant from mars opening in london and saying this is a modern british cooking yeah
oh really the judges will definitely be looking for food that's out of this world tomorrow when atul and jason present all four of their dishes but they haven't finished this one yet and with all the elements of his arctic roll ready jason quickly assembles his classic dessert it's a revelation to atul
i had no clue how it would be maybe it's like a swiss roll or i don't know how you do it when you said arctic roll i thought there will be some ice cream as the name suggests that's all i could think of but it's fascinating
all you do is sort of roll it up and what you have there is a quintessential
arctic roll
english arctic roll super arctic
jason's nearly finished and all atul has to do is check his sorbet
look at that that's proper sorbet
all right atul
yeah yeah go on we're going mate
time to plate up and jason carefully decorates his plate with fruits and then portions out his raspberry and sarawak pepper jelly the arctic rolls now get a generous coating of vanilla sugar atul carefully places the cardamom and lime panna cotta quickly heats through some strawberries with balsamic vinegar and black pepper and puts them on his shortbread biscuits he completes the dish with a dusting of dehydrated strawberries and a smooth strawberry sorbet
beautiful well a bit of summer on the plate i guess yup
but your's is gorgeous
perfect i love it
while jason takes his plate into another room to give his honest opinion
yeah it looks pretty worth the wait but you know it's all down in the eating
so what does the man who doesn't eat puddings think of his own dessert
it's fine i'm quite happy the way it is it's simplistic it's nice and it's tasty
he's modesty personified perhaps jason will have a bit more to say
you can really taste the cardamom the idea of toasting them really works that could have been a bit softer it should have more give on it than that i'd serve the shortbread a bit on the side it makes it a bit difficult to eat like that the sorbet's melted too quickly so maybe set the sorbet a little bit quicker
something of a technical demolition job there anything else
still can be categorised as modern british but it's italian at the end of the day simple as that classic italian dessert
so it's not british enough for jason nothing can dent atul's confidence
anything i put on the plate i think it will be the winner otherwise i wouldn't put it down
jason's sure that this won't beat his dish
arctic roll at least is a classic english dessert and i'm hoping it's gonna put a smile on the judge's faces tomorrow
he's confident but it's time to change places and see what they both make of jason's dessert
it's as pretty as a painting it's very beautiful very nicely done and i'm impressed it's beautiful
so unqualified praise for his rival's presentation is jason happy with it
dessert should put a smile on your face at the end of your meal yeah after that you're gonna get the bill so you want a smile on your face yep
but atul isn't smiling i think he knows he's up against it
very nice jelly ice cream is just right i was just worried that it might be too frozen it's just right it's absolutely right it's really well done very well executed i can't take any punches on it and i'm very angry about it
so is he ready to concede defeat
looking at this i think it's a great dessert but i still prefer mine because it has got more flavours to play it may not look as pretty as this but making pretty is not difficult this dessert is good but it doesn't worry me
tomorrow it's judgment day and both chefs will cook their full four course menu for the judges to taste for the most part atul has concentrated on finessing his modern british indian dishes while jason's strategy is to take more risks and hope that it pays off but which approach is going to prevail
someone here has gone for the safety game
the one bit of modernity on this dish is the one thing i really hate
how do the chefs feel ahead of the final showdown
final day is basically your judgement day and you have to perform your best
as soon as i found out what happened i rush here
she is looking for her seventeen year old son
i have been here for four days
some geological experts all over the world california and other places say that is not really the case things are going up fast and not safely the two don't go together
there is one thing as to what is happening in the moment in terms of the building boom but if you think about where we live most of the houses we are living are much older than one the first earthquake code was introduced in china nineteen seventy four we live in victorian or edwardian houses they would all be designed to a lower level
prone to earthquakes how could you fix it
maybe it is the material time maybe the age of the building maybe it was built in the wrong place it is difficult to judge at the minute without the information i would surmise they are probably older buildings which are more
are reasonable the codes it is difficult to say anything more
zygmunt lubkowsky thank you for joining us george bush has been addressing the israeli parliament in a gesture of his nation's containing solidarity with israel as it marks the sixtieth anniversary of its foundation this was a time of joy for the jews but catastrophe for the palestinians hundreds of thousands fled their homes to other parts of the country on neighbouring arab states their descendants insist on their right to return this has been a main stumbling block in any peace sniggers station between israelis and palestinians we report from ramallah on a day of demonstrations by the palestinians as they mark a very different kind of anniversary from the israelis this is a day when palestinians remember what they feel is the blackest moment in their history these balloons were released at points where the wind would carry them over israel in memories of those who died and hundreds of thousands who left or were forced to flee their homes sixty years ago as well as being a day of mourning this is also a day on which palestinians including those in refugee camps like this one in the west bank reaffirm their belief and their commitment that they will one day return to the lands that their forefathers left there were large protest demonstrations in towns and cities across the west bank and gaza it asserts that palestinian belief that they have the moral and legal right to return many here have been angered by the visit to the region by president bush who they feel has ignored their plight in favour of joining in the festivities as israel celebrates sixty years of independence
over the past six decades the jewish people have established a state that would make that humble rabbi proud you have raised a modern society in the promised land a light unto the nations that preserves the legacy of abraham and isaac and jacob you have both a mighty democracy that will ensure forever you have built you can always count on the united states of america to be at your side god bless
heartening words for israelis but for palestinians the speech reinforced their widely held belief that america is not an honest peace broker it will bring them no closer to gaining any of their key goals among them what they feel is their right to return to their historic lands something simply unacceptable to most israelis joining us from ramallah is the former palestinian telecommunications minister sabri saidam who supports mahmoud abbas's movement there is no reason why america can't be both friends of the israelis and
pictures of george bush addressing the knesset
i have to say this is a sad day in history whether palestinians have the plight of occupation not only to see a wall being erected and apartheid wall been erected a big group of people today marched in the streets it was the fulfilment of the right of a return i'd is sad to see those people always looking and seeking a solution and a reasonable and just solution for the united nations resolutions to remain outstanding it is sad
stigma with george bush's visit how far did the palestinians believe that the u. s. camp can click its fingers and the u. s. israeli settlements would be disbanded and palestinians would be given estate does the u. s. have that power over the israelis
closest ally in the region it says we don't just have you as a strategic partner as with egypt and saudi arabia but we have shared values with you a commitment to democracy that is what the u. s. says
democracy is about the fourth omid of people's aspirations it is about the respective democracy the fulfilment even that was not respected democracy has to be not only preached but practised and respected people have to acknowledge the process and results not only the process palestinians will have to fulfil their aspirations about the establishment of a palestinian state and the americans would have to come to the fact that they need to have fulfilled the division of president bush of the establishment of a palestinian estate by accomplishing the road map that he drew in two thousand three instead of celebrating his rare's is sixty anniversary and the plight of the palestinians israel's sixtieth anniversary we will have to go a step further and see more american pressure establishing a palestinian
it is difficult for you to compete
going when the younger generation is not so interested in manufacturing we want the foreign workers not just temporaryily but trained to work with us long term
individual for the most part rather a long term angst at an economy that is not showing growth to its potential
customers tell a different story people are not spending the money
any energy you can really feel the gap between us and those up there in tokyo
back in tokyo where toshiaki funakubo from the tack tri is out with his friends here there is more optimism
the japanese have a lot of special skills and good ideas to produce cars and clothes and special materials so you know japanese economy will go i think
but also from these tycoons of tomorrow realism they can't and won't rely on politician they say to help their businesses
i for one depend on the government if you can make good money for yourself then you don't worry about it
they're soft skfz striking will that be enough with out doubt tough decisions will be needed soon to prolong the pros pefpt the japanese have grown the prosperity that the japanese have grown accustomed to more than one hundred years ago a series of grizzly murders gripped the nation the killer was never found but the name he was given strikes fear into the hearts of many even today jack the ripper now a new exhibition that opens in the docklands has brought together the police document the press reports and the other historical archive from the time why is there still so much interest in an unsolved crime this report contains graphic descriptions of the murders
not only is there a cut acorbgs but the incigss on the stomach and two wounds in the genital area
gruesome brutal terrifying a serial killer on the lose laos in the poverty ridden streets of the east end women were being butchered victorian london was grip by fear the news paper of the the news papers of the day were making the most of it
the press developed the sorry in story way that no one could have predicted traixally the stories with gruesome elements were played down it was not acceptable to report the graphic detail for some reason in the one thousand eight hundred eighties things began to free up there was more and more competition and the star launched in the year of the ripper murders it almost overnight became the world's best selling evening news paper this was largely as a result of reporting stories on the jack the ripper
the murders shone an uncomfortable light on the slums of london's east end the dos houses and drinking den the dim lit alley ways were the prostitutes plied their trade but the old reputation of the area lives on believe it or not all of these people have paid good money tor taken on a guided tour of the sites of the jack the ripper murders but why what is this morbid fascination with a century old serial killer
the source was kout right the way from the backbone the head cut off from the body
jack the ripper has become an industry movies about the murders books about the bodyis how did a

if you can't beat the celebrities why don't you join them just when you thought you had missed your opportunity to have a bestseller written about you a new publishing phenomenon means you can have modern memory they are writing them about ordinary people louise miller helps publish people's lives
i am part of a new industry of journalist setting up businesses to write people's memorys
i don't mean to be rude but there are some dull people in the world
i think it's important my parents came from abroad there were a lot of things i never asked them now it's too late tom wrote his first and when i read the draft i thought i would like to write mine because it was inaccurate from the way i thought even the way we met wasn't correct it's a question of whose memory is correct
is yours correct or hers
mine is the accurate one
to life behind the scenes
this is what cherie blair's book was supposed to do
your memorys will be an excellent read have you thought about it
of your book
most of the time it ceases to have a spellbinding
would it be hard to write you have these fantastical flights of fancy
would it be difficult to write
fact yul book
the flights of fancy are are in my head l. have been told the way to do it is make stuff up the missing year of your life when you were working on a whaler i am busy living it
you were saying one of the problems is every tom dick and harry is writing them
my book is called indian takeaway is available in bookshops
that is against broadcasting rules
fair enough it's also not ta good
i don't know l. suppose the police ask them when they catch them l. hoped i try and make them entertaining and sometimes thoughtful and the thing about the popularity of genres is that they tend to be written in an old fashioned way they have plot and character and they adhere to the old fashioned rules of storytelling
terry believe it or not has been diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's that is when the disease effects you before the age of sixty five doctors say it's a condition set to become more common over the next ten years yet the n. h. s. has cut vital treatment proven to work for middle aged sufferers lucy siegle spent the day with remarkable woman whose story will be familiar to terry meet heather roberts like terry pratchett she is one of the fifteen thousand people in the u. k. who have early onset alzheimer's earlier this
year terry donatesed half
million pounds towards research into the disease
i wanted to fight the disease it was simple it was a sheer vie carous sense of i want to hit back in some way this end of the day i am up and ready and i am sensible and fine everything is working fine
heather has always played tennis but practise sessions are a crucial part of her aim to maintain normality as the alzheimer's takes hold l. joined her and husband dave on the court so het irer you weren't intimidated by my dreful game you are a good player
i used to be a good player it's only indicationally you see glimpses of that when everything works a lot of the time it's sort of all over the place or the racket goes over the court or i miss the ball and the timing is wrong that is all part of the alzirms and the way it effect mess alzheimer's
finished work really to do something with heather she is still far better than me even though she is not as good as she used to be
is it difficult to come down here and admit you now have a weakness
spend it
all spend it is that difficult are you aware of how much you are
the frame of mind what is going to happen in ten years you are not going to have this moment again in ten years time your mum is not going to be the person you know right now that is hard to accept
it's the end of the day and heather is back at home with her family alzheimer's is something they have all had to deal with as more and more people are touched by the disease heather believes a new openness is needed
we have talk about this l. am going to fight this all the way down there are some days you can't count it so skru to give in gracefully but most of the time i am going to fight it all the way
terry you saw heather taking a determinedly cheerful approach is that something you have been able to do
the day after i was diagnosed and i was working in the garden and i realised i was whistling l. have a natural cheerfulness which bubbles to the top as i said in the film i wanted to do something l. phoned up the alzheimer's research trust and talk to them l. said i am going to give you a million dollars because you know how it is you come back from the states you have been asleep on the plane when the envelope comes around and you have a few dollars left in your pocket i have always wanted to give away one million dollars suddenly everyone was talking about it everyone was so surprised that someone was going to own up to having alzheimer's but there is nothing to be ashamed of
you were misdiagnosed it wasn't anyone's fault have
rare variant which is why i can still write the books but the typing is hard the forefront the bit that is me is working quite well long may that continue you make up work arounds but i can't drive a car because my visual acuity is askew l. might not see my mobile phone if it's on the table you can't drive a car in that case because you might not see a little girl on a zebra crossing
what does the future hold for you
travel very fast but because of the speed of light it either knew where it was going or who it was
old do they live to
most people are unaware that they might have them in the
be the gardener's best friend if you wanted to attract them to your garden we have got carpet tiles on our lawn
yes anything that is flat against the ground basically
these wooden boards and metal sheets heat up in the sun allowing the cold blooded reptiles to warm up safely out of sight of predatory gulls flat home was connected to the mainland and we think that slow worms were marooned when sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age ten thousand years ago another potential site fingers crossed
this might be quite heavy
you can see the black stripe going all the way down the sides this is a male much more uniform in colour with the lovely blue spots
yes along him as well
you managed to catch a juvenile as well that is just fantastic as an adult male who is absolutely huge with an enormous head he is massive compared to the small juvenile we have a whole family it's great it seems early to find a juvenile in may l. thought they bred in may
there has been evidence to suggest that in fact if they breed later in the year they can in fact hibernate and give birth whilst when they come out of hibernation
i came here because of the sheer abundance of slow worms and they are easy to find you might have them on your back doorstep and not know it they love to hide in compost heaps they like the slugs and snails from the gardens it is incredible to think they have survived on this tiny outpost in the middle of the bristol channel for ten thousand years and surprising to think they are providing us with a natural pest control without us really being aware of it next time you are raking through the leaves just keep an eye out for the wonderfully mysterious and very secretive slow worms miranda is here and some of the slow worms very at home they are protected
they are if any building construction work is going on in this country surveys have to be done and if there are slow worms they have to be rounded up and rehoned it is important we look after our reptiles we only have six native pep tiles slow worms are not that common
terry would you like one to hold
we have them in the garden
they are a gardener's best friend
they are
you should look after them
better than sliding along so why lose them
they like hiding underneath and if you look at the skeleton of a slow worm it does have limbs so they did have legs once upon a time they like hiding and the legs got in the way so they evolved to lose them and that's why they have ended up how they are now
lovely to see you and your worms can i ask you to do something for us see this we pay tribute to the potato all hail i am bringing you all back to ireland with me because we all love them there all week we have been going crazy the series highlighted the remarkable properties of this extraordinary vegetable last night we showed you varieties last night shini somarathne could show us how it could save the planet most of us would have learnt to make a potato battery that powers something like a small clock but it has another side a side so incredible that the future of manufacturing may depend on it the u. k. throws away nearly three million tonnes of plastic each year ninety per cent ends up in landfill where it can remain for decades or even centuries potato starch is a biopolymer which looks like this and this is a similar structure to conventional plastics so in theory wherever you use disposable plastic you could use potato starch instead established over seven years ago this is one of the companies in the u. k. making plastic from potatos potatoes we are going to make the mixtures that you put into
the plastics but eventually wants to recycle from chip factories
putting the water in now this is what turns it into a mash
it looks like pancake mix
basically it is
can we eat it
no wouldn't recommend eating it you can eat it of course
that is so lovely so what happened next
it is ready to pump into the mold
there we have
you can see it you have got to get rid of all the water in the mixture there is your finished plate wow look at that nice and
this technology that gets me excited what about supercharged spuds it can do zero to sixty in under four seconds has a top speed in excess of one forty m. p. h. and the tyres are made from potatoes in fact the components of the car sound
delicious a handful of potatoes
potato tyre
the race is on to find a solution the answer could be as cheap as chips she mentioned there about making potato clocks at school l. never did that
the south we all want to be there it's an ideal it draws us to it it's a mythical place
sea sex and sun
to britons today the south is exuberant vines guiltless hedonism excitable olives the immemorial ruins of immemorial civilisations primary coloured emotions it's a promised land and a role supermodel our wine is from the south we eat the south's food we vertically tan to look southern oranges do come from the south our architects are going to remake rundown yorkshire towns as tuscan hill villages because britain and italy share a common culture and a common climate the south causes the north to suffer a collective delusion about itself we deny our northernness we deny it to such an extent that we are unfamiliar with those countries that share our climate they might remind us of ourselves they too are engaged in a perpetual battle denying their northernness to be northern is to be forever ill at ease with oneself why ever would anyone go north out of curiosity exoticism may not depend exclusively on ouzo and olives and if the north like the south is more than a cardinal point of the compass where is it where does it start
que j. e. croyais voir le ciel bleu j'apprenais mes lecons la joue contre son bras j. e. crois qu'il etait fier de moi il etait genereux comme ceux du pays et j. e. lui dois ce que j. e. suis au nord c'etaient les corons la terre c'etait du charbon le ciel c'etait l'horizon les homme les mineurs du fond le ciel c'etait l'horizon les homme les mineurs du fond
the late pierre bachelet's sentimental anthem tells us that slagheaps are to the north what sybaritism is to the south it also tells us that this is where the north begins here in the department of france called baldly nord
hit the north by the fall hit the north aaaaaah hit the north hit the north my cat says
the north starts here in flanders in the tapestry town of arras which gave its name to the kind of screen polonius was behind when he suffered his unfortunate accident i first came here the first time i travelled to italy nothing i subsequently saw in pienza or san gimigniano or siena impressed me the way that these great squares did there was obviously something wrong with me the man who preferred the flemish to the florentine who still prefers it in fifteen hundred arras had a population of less than ten thousand yet it built these great urban squares and a splendid town hall when excavations are made in flanders for roads and railways the bones of men slaughtered in the first world war constitute the first stratum that diggers encounter further down are multitudinous herring skeletons the people of arras ate between two and three million herrings per year that's two to three hundred for every person they were faithful to the staple but then they had no choice that's what a staple means but what a staple this supposedly humble fish which actually infinitely preferable to lobster or sole has incited great ingenuity in humans our forbears have smoked it in countless ways sweet cured it sour cured it soused it in gin soused it vinegar eaten it raw buried it fermented it herring is still a staple eaten north of here for more than a thousand miles from flanders to the furthest shores of the baltic there exists a uniformity as distinctive as that of the mediterranean a uniformity which is much more than gastronomic a uniformity fractured by neighbourly murderousness down the centuries but which remains manifest in architecture in art in food and drink in schnapps and beer ah the north is as much an ideal as the south it's the unpromised land of darkness of the gothic in all its forms of thrilling grimness exhilarating harshness inky canals fog glistening cobbles of buildings that respond to flatlands and vast skies with spires fantastical rooflines wild gables pointed arches and slagheaps which man made to compensate for the lack of mountains northern art has down the centuries shunned broad brush marks in favour of minute detail it revels in the grotesque and the discomfiting it is born out of disgust at our bodies despair at our mores the northern spirit is one of baleful neurosis grinning cynicism and gleeful misanthropy it is excited by bleak deformities it is characterised by existential gloom it relishes horrible laughter fear mockery joyless perversity rather than the pursuit of happiness it is not immune to beauty but its idea of beauty is far from classical it is jagged as i say the north is seldom at ease with itself southern europeans hold their liquor and shun mass drunkenness that anyway is the myth there is a corresponding myth about northern europeans they escape from themselves by drinking for oblivion and then by suicide that is if cirrhosis hasn't got them first neither proposition is strictly accurate but we tend to believe the latter because we know so little of the north beer is to the north what woods are to bears an essential necessity wine's primacy is vanquished the flatlands are a borderland because they occupy latitudes where vines cease to be productive the weather's not up to it

it had been introduced with the monarchy's restoration in one thousand six hundred sixty charles the second had spent much of his exile in holland it wasn't just gin that britain owed to the low countries there was dutch courage there was william of orange there was also the quiet harmonious immediately post gothic architectural style that britain copied from such towns as middelburg
somebody give me my gin
gin was to that era what crack and smack are to our own the difference was that it was a coveted source of revenue it was said of the united provinces' inhabitants that they hate their states yet love their liquor and pay excise rather like britain today any shrewd exchequer knows that the appetite for liquor will always overcome prudence

fruits such as grapes ferment naturally cereals don't so malting was arrived at as the means to stimulate fermentation in cereals because intoxication is an elemental human need a need that increases as the climate becomes hostile towards cultivation whilst at the same time demanding to be countered by dreams by walls of blankness thus where the need is greatest there are the fewest means of satisfying it where the living isn't easy higher levels of resourcefulness are required to create the chemical illusion of ease which is a vital compensation ingenuity exists or should exist in direct proportion to a landscape's hostility and a climate's severity zeeland is well named sea land neither land nor sea land which was once sea land which is forever threatened by the sea and may become sea again the reclamation of land from sea and beyond that the creation of land where there was none are testimonies to dutch ingenuity this is a country whose most basic fabric is man made this is not the natural world it is the unnatural world nature has been defeated and man has for the time being at least triumphed and because he has triumphed he feels at liberty to take diabolical liberties the great painters of the northern tradition van der weyden and van eyck bosch and bouts never allow their subjects which are sometimes religious to occlude their worldliness this tradition continues today the pietism of their subject matter is undermined by high artifice the aesthetic austerities and the humility of the south are nowhere to be seen sacred art in the north does not dissemble technique flair brio the painter is omnipresent never letting you forget that all this is achieved through human skill according to bosch heaven is a dogger's paradise a celestial car park rendezvous and so too is hell the difference being that pigs are dressed as nuns the artist is more interested in inventing than in preaching but what if bosch was wrong what if all this corrupting flesh is just so much wishful thinking and both heaven and hell are car parks where no one turns up where you are alone forever
seagulls call in distance
just as the north's native drinks are beer and distilled grain so is its true architecture the gothic the gothic is indigenous it starts where vines stop which may of course be completely by chance the cathedrals of saint denis laon saint quentin soissons reims coutances and this one at amiens are not merely remarkable structures they provided the template for countless others they created the architectural idiom that in its various guises would dominate northern europe for four hundred years from the twelve hundreds to the sixteen hundreds the gothic spread north like an architectonic pandemic the north and gothic architecture would become indissolubly bound to each other in the north the gothic was the norm indeed the gothic outlived the gothic age it never went away it never will northern religious architecture is of course made to the glory of god it creates spaces where mankind can abase itself before an imported spiritual idea yet this scared architecture like contemporary painting is just as concerned with a markedly earthbound showing off of course sumptuous carving and abundant sculpture signify civic might a town's pride and wealth but they also boast about the craftsman's prowess there is a paradox here the human maker's omnipresence is apparent in gothic in a way that it is not in classical structures but it is classical structures which are notionally founded in proportions derived from the human body gothic architecture is akin to shakespeare's art sublime and vulgar monstrous and tender it steals from everywhere the gothic is not underpinned by an intellectual formula least of all by an abstraction that precedes the work a generic rulebook man does not base the gothic upon his measurable body but upon what occurs in his immeasurable mind and imagination the gothic was fluid it encouraged invention tyrants and autocrats have seldom espoused it because it does not represent order it represents rather individuality and originality gothic buildings evidently acknowledge their precursors but they don't copy them gothic was in its way progressive always seeking to improve or at least to be different this consensus over long centuries and great distances was merely architectural nothing more architecture can be a bond but not here here it was a mask which disguised schisms it papered over the northern post reformation appetite for ever dividing communions communions whose dogmatic differences seem mere hair splitting to the outsider such factionalism was mocked in the one thousand six hundred fifties by andrew marvell sure when religion did itself embark and from the east would westward steer its ark it struck and splitting on this unknown ground each one thence pillag'd the first piece he found hence amsterdam turk christian pagan jew staple of sects and mint of schism grew that bank of conscience where not one so strange opinion but finds credit and exchange edam there is a dutch saying that when three people meet they form a sect and when a fourth joins the sect splits in two over doctrinal differences this is the one and true cheese these are apostate cheeses because they are flavoured with caraway and with cloves and this is the cheese of heretics because it is flavoured with pepper may they sneeze in hell numerous mutually tolerant confessions co existed in the early sixteen hundreds this co existence was encouraged by those whose enduring god was money for they stood to gain from it a merchant guild or fellowship whose members are of different faiths and cultures is less restricted in whom it can do business with than one which is uniformly composed sectarianism diminishes religion's temporal power countless diverging sects cannot exercise the sort of control that a single church can religion then ceases to dominate the everyday it becomes what you might call a faith style choice an add on the north is where religion began to grow up began to self secularise the first graphic step in that process was iconoclasm stripping churches of idolatrous images which are no more than jujus the resultant post reformation church interiors bereft of amulets were the invariable subject of the paintings made in the first half of the sixteen hundreds by the haarlem master pieter saenredam the extent of their secularisation is made obvious churches had become public parks with a roof you might amble converse hang out lie around visit as a tourist or make paintings of them saenredam's paintings are spellbinding in their stillness lack of incident lack of all but a few isolated individuals who are engaged in anything but worship all saenredam took from van der weyden let alone bosch was an obsession with meticulous detail otherwise he is cold dispassionate objective he invented an art of self proclaiming understatement it appears worryingly bland stubbornly mute nothing happens in a most emphatic way yet the very absences provoke foreboding and discomfiture they persuade the spectator to wonder what is not being shown they imply an unspoken mystery a metaphysical mystery not a transcendental mystery he talks quietly and subtly about the sheer marvellousness of human life human sensibility human ingenuity saenredam's achievement was peculiar and it was for centuries unacknowledged it was not till the twentieth century till the advent of the machine age that his austerity and blankness rang a bell his detachedness became a northern norm so widely emulated that there is effectively a continuous school of saenredam self consciously glacial non committal and as pregnant with possibility as those churches where something may or may not be about to happen something terrible his bleakly humanistic example is discernible in the work of a school of painters who are hardly known in britain because britain looked south gave slavering forelock to the broad brushmarks of mediterranean satyrs so northern painters such as the dutchman carel willink and the weimar republic artists richard oelze christian schad franz radziwill are absurdly overlooked and so too are their current peers no matter how brilliant they may be
my name is annemarie busschers painter i live and work in groningen
who is it
my husband tonnis how many portraits have you made of him um three
this is the gough map one of the oldest surviving maps of britain drawn on sheepskin it's over six hundred years old no one knows who made it or why but it offers a unique window onto life at the height of the middle ages in this series i'll be using it to travel the length and breadth of britain today the gough map is taking me to south west england i'll find out what myths and legends can tell us about the origins of the map i'll see how our medieval forebears lived and died and up on britain's wild moors i'll go hunting with falcons and eagles the gough map was made in the early one thousand three hundred sixties when edward the third was on the throne it represents a breakthrough in cartography the oldest surviving map to depict britain accurately showing towns rivers marked in green and nearly three thousand miles of routes marked in red but creating an accurate map of britain was not the sole motivation of the map makers contained within it are clues that suggest the gough map was made to legitimise the monarchy and to sanction royal authority over the realm today i'll follow the only route into the west country my final destination is dartmouth where i'll explore one of the most enigmatic inscriptions on the map but my journey starts in hampshire one thing that strikes you immediately when you get on the road is that a lot of places that are today really quite small were once hugely important this is certainly true of winchester at the time of the gough map it was the gateway to the south west straddling the only route from london to cornwall it was a centre of power and influence attracting visitors from all over europe when they arrived here they would have heard something astonishing winchester was famous for its choir it still is but what few visitors realised then as now is that winchester was the birthplace of one of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of music something called the winchester troper a manuscript which records a revolutionary new way of performing the old chants of religious worship
and what's polyphony then is this when you're singing in more than one
it's more than one part and the parts are very equally spaced and they interweave their own melodies and this is the version as it appears in the troper itself
they sing in harmony
the difference may sound subtle to our ears but one thousand years ago the troper represented a bold innovation it's funny to think isn't it that there was a time before polyphony i mean it seems so intuitive to us so natural that you would have music in more than one part
exactly and and it's been fascinating to watch this develop starting from this very simple one line of music that was written on one line physically one line and the notes just started to go up and down that's the only way they could tell that they were to sing higher or sing lower and then gradually another line appeared and so you could get higher and lower then this whole thing of another part now going through to symphony orchestras of one hundred fifty players you know but it all comes down to things like this winchester troper
they sing in harmony
i'm taking a brief detour from the map's red route my destination is glastonbury abbey what happened there in the twelfth century provides a clue about the real purpose of the gough map glastonbury was one of the most significant abbeys in the country at the time of the gough map it owed this prominence at least in part to a longstanding and highly successful campaign designed to flatter and legitimise the english crown the abbey helped create a legend around a man who had he lived at all had died at the dawn of the middle ages his name was king arthur the arthur legend came of age in a country that had really only become a coherent centralised nation a century or so before the rulers of the young kingdom needed to legitimise their power one technique that they used was to invent or from their point of view to discover legends and traditions by stoking the arthur myth and claiming him as a blood ancestor the king suddenly had a royal heroic predecessor the monarchy looked favourably on anyone who unearthed convincing evidence of the royal blood line and all of a sudden arthurian relics started popping up all over the place someone found arthur's crown someone else found excalibur and his signet ring they even found the round table but the most highly prized find and the linchpin of the new cult was arthur's body and that was found here at glastonbury abbey and under highly suspicious circumstances this fortuitous discovery deserved a royal funeral a lavish ceremony was arranged attended by none other than king edward i and edward himself wrapped arthur's enormous bones in cloth before they were reinterred right here in what was then the very heart of glastonbury abbey so potent was the legend that nearly two hundred years after the discovery of arthur's body here at glastonbury the makers of the gough map saw fit to include four sites of particularly arthurian interest here's glastonbury itself and tintagel arthur's fortress pendragon castle the home of arthur's father is here and finally the wathelan a small magical lake mentioned in the arthurian legends including these four sites suggests that the makers of the gough map were seeking to legitimise the monarchy with references to its potent arthurian heritage from glastonbury i'm heading south and back onto the red route marked on the map alongside all of the red routes on the map are roman numerals indicating distance and these are probably in old french miles as the english mile hadn't yet been standardised the gough map is the oldest and maybe even the first map of britain to combine routes with distances as every route has these numerals it seems that the cartographer only included routes when he knew the precise distances involved at the time of the gough map this region was famous for its cider production it still is you might think of cider as the quintessential english drink but actually its mass production was first brought here by the normans who made it on an almost industrial scale the gough map's red route takes me to honiton where there's a medieval style cider mill still in operation it may be ancient but it can still produce cider by the barrow load
the shape of that granite wheel and the actual trough it runs in is set so that the apples get churned about a bit like a plough and as the wheel goes around the apples fold in behind it if you let it do its thing it's actually well designed get on get on get up get up get up
even today in england the french roots of cider are revealed in the jargon used by cider makers this pulp is called pomace which comes from pomme the french for apple
if you put a layer of straw in every two inches that'll actually hold it firm so that it'll stay solid and then also the juice'll run out through your layers of straw as well
and then what happens applying pressure and the juice'll start to run out fermented for six months this one pressing will produce five hundred eighty litres of cider it's just coming off in a torrent
oh it will do it will do
wow but it wasn't to last in the fourteen hundreds the arrival of hops from the netherlands allowed british brewers to produce beer it soon became the national drink and cider was off the menu in the later middle ages a deadly disease reached epidemic proportions in britain in this area alone many towns were affected colliford honiton tiverton and exmouth all appear in documents that chronicle the terrifying spread of leprosy these medieval skeletons bear the telltale signs of the deadly disease
the most evocative and disturbing are those that affect the face so the nose actually recedes and disappears where you see in this normal individual that the nose stands quite proud from the face whereas this one is quite receded he would have had probably very little nose left the disease basically destroys nerve tissue they lose the sensation of their hands and feet their walking is affected the way they hold things is affected the facial expressions are affected they can't smile their voices alter so they're very hoarse so it really does change their identity
leprosy allowed secondary infections to destroy bones this foot bone shows how one leper suffered
what is a normal quite sturdy shaft of the bone here is little more than a small projection
so that should look like that that's right yes yes my god so this is normal what's in my left hand
what would be left of the foot at this stage is probably difficult to recognise toes if they existed at all just a fleshy pulp yes and a foot that was swollen lacerated full of weeping sores
there was little that could be done to alleviate their suffering
the medieval hospital is much less about trying to cure an individual physically and more trying to deal with the sort of spiritual aspects than a modern hospital will be they would be given in most of these houses some kind of remedial care that might be little more than just bathing and healthy eating and of course spiritual guidance
the popular idea now is that these leper colonies were like prisons but they did seem to offer lepers a kind of better place to live
yeah i think more often they offered them a better place to die not only for death but for the long suffering that led up to death and drawing illusions between that long suffering and what it meant to be a christian a christian in the sort of shape of christ and his suffering
yeah yes and it's a very different conception of life and death and one that we would find i think probably quite shocking and unacceptable
this one is part of a horse's head
wow how marvellous oh he's beautiful
shall i give them to you do you mind if i have a look
it's amazing that they survived they're so thin the wax
yeah they are incredibly fragile the craftsmanship is lovely
so do you think this is somebody who has a sick horse
that's exactly what i think yes well possibly even a sick horse's head can i just and where they would have been put was hung on waxed strings above the tomb of bishop lacy bishop edmond lacy was bishop of exeter for thirty five or so years in the middle of the fifteenth century and came to be venerated locally and could easily have been made a saint one assumes but the reformation intervened as it were and towards the end of his life he became very ill in different ways but notably he had bad legs this could account for the apparent preponderance of legs and feet among the fragments of the votives and this is obviously a foot inside a shoe so whoever would have bought this particular mould would have had gout or something wrong with their feet
what's really marvellous to me as an as an art historian is that very often the kind of things i look at are super high status works of art cathedrals stained glass but what's almost entirely lost to us are the ephemeral things the kind of everyday objects that ordinary people would have so it's just such a fantastic thing to see something like this but the undamaged model of a woman was the prize discovery
that's her in all her glory
you can really see details of her costume buttons on her sleeve she's quite an elegant lady she is
and as all the images are is hollow so very light and very fragile
do you know how many other examples survive or is this basically what we have
i think in britain this is basically what we have yes
the exeter wax votives are a unique legacy from an age where faith was considered the route to health and longevity i'm heading up onto dartmoor in weather as inhospitable as this it's easy to see why the map makers saw fit to depict this desolate place as a large empty circle in fact many of britain's most dangerous places are sketchily represented like the scottish highlands and snowdonia in wales despite the dangers moors and highlands were used for hunting and one form in particular took off in the middle ages falconry under norman law hunting with birds was the exclusive preserve of the nobility then at the turn of the thirteenth century an act was passed allowing any freeman to keep hawks and by the late middle ages this type of hunting had pervaded almost every layer of medieval society however allowing any tom dick or harold to participate didn't change the fact that medieval society had a fearsomely rigid class structure the birds themselves each became linked with a particular social class the less fancy falcons and hawks were suitable for the lower tiers of society so a kestrel like this was for a knave a knave being a servant or a man of humble birth whereas a male peregrine a tiercel was considered suitable for a prince the largest falcon the gyr being rather more glamorous was ideal for a king however top of the charts was this the eagle a bird like this was deemed fit for an emperor birds of prey were considered so special they were used as peace offerings or as tokens of respect and friendship the king of scotland once gave edward the third a single gyr falcon as a present edward was so thrilled that he tipped the man who delivered it forty shillings the equivalent of nine hundred the hunting style varied depending on the bird being used
the falcons are aerial predators and they'd be used for hunting grouse it was the sheer dash of the falcons that attracted nobility on a good day with the wind behind him one hundred miles an hour shouldn't be a problem for this little fellow when the falconer was ready he'd send the dogs in the grouse would flush and then they'd go for the vertical stoop of the falcon straight down on the prey whereas the falcon is up hunting with eagles you'll hunt off the fist you'll flush quarry the eagle will see them and it'll go for it whereas the falcon is using speed to overwhelm its quarry eagles will use sheer physical size and strength to overwhelm it
see ya later

i might've jumped to a few conclusions i thought pole dancing was just dead eyed women dancing for fat sweaty blokes
my selling pitch would be more great body work out more fun than aerobics
sure a classy girl like you can handle it
think i can manage
it's not all businessmen and cocktails more lager goes down it can get pretty steamy

you didn't think i could handle it no
i knew what you'd say and this morning i didn't wanna hear it but you're the only one who knows how i really feel what i should do
there's only one thing you can do in a situation like this
yeah i think so too
i'm on my way to heathrow airport to catch a flight to dubai thousands of muslim women go to dubai and they all go to dubai to shop because it is unbelievable it's got loads of foreign influence loads of eastern twists so i'm going to do some serious shopping i'm gonna hook up with my friend mimi she's originally from saudi and she lives there now but she's flying in to meet me in dubai to do some shopping she does that quite a lot there's stella mccartney that's where mimi use to work when she lived in london come with me i'm gonna show you the secret world of the dubayy style monsters we muslim women now make up ten per cent of the population of the entire world sometimes it feels as if the rest of you see us as shapeless black blobs well you've seen a veil before tonight i'll show you what lies beneath we are the women in black so here i am just landed and it's time for my dubayy muslim makeover that's right dubayy not dubai abayas and shaylas black coats and scarves aren't compulsory here as they are in other parts of the middle east so sometimes i wear them sometimes i don't i doubt i'm going to impress my friend mimi though there are strict rules on women's fashions here but the style police work in a slightly different way so good to see you good to see you
how's everything good really good welcome to dubayy thank you
mimi this is amazing
thank you so much it's like a crochet style now yeah with this indian textile thing
it looks good what is this bag oh thanks marc jacobs fantastic
i love it it's my baby you look great very divine thank you thank you
i knew you'd say that plain
yeah i think we better go shopping in dubayy
yeah a little bit of bling dust
shall we let's go
dubayy sprung up out of the desert thirty five years ago it got rich on oil i've been visiting since i was a kid when it was the size of luton and just as unfashionable now it's the second largest city in the united arab emirates this is where wealthy muslim women come to be seen this city is like an attention seeking child look at me i'm the tallest the fastest the flashiest it's liberating if you've flown in from the drabber parts of the middle east but let's face it you're either rich or poor in this town there's no in between there's a competitive edge to the glamour that rubs off on anyone who comes here mimi's taking me for a super grooming session first stop a very discreet women only club its beauty clinic caters for the super rich corporate housewives of dubai this is where the city's finest women get groomed it's ladies only so we don't need our shaylas and abayas as you may know hair removal for all muslim women the world over is absolutely essential i'm gonna get waxed yeuch i've always been brought up to get waxing when i was at school and all my english friends when they started to shave their legs it was just unheard of my mum flipped she was like you're gonna do what no and she took me to the bathroom i'll never forget that day i hate getting it done but i have to although here unlike other muslim countries they're not too shy to get a hollywood done in the salons i'm having my eyebrows done too eyes are a big flirty tool in this country i'm actually fond of my eyebrows
i wouldn't go out with eyebrows like that
it's part of the culture the grooming and maintenance how much do you spend
this obsession with image fuels dubayy's beauty market worth an estimated one point one billion do you think la la was harsh about what she said about me
well you definitely need to up your game in dubai it's a different field completely than what we're used to in london
so will people not want to talk to me if i don't look if i don't have any make up on
not necessarily you hesitated there
so there's a possibility that you know
it's just that it's in the culture to look good
i'm absolutely exhausted i've been waxed plucked and tweaked within an inch of life mimi's still in there what i'm beginning to realise is my old fashioned yemeni abaya just isn't going to cut it here it's too plain boring almost old fashioned i need to get one dubai style so we're driving past all the flash malls to completely the wrong end of town to go to an unassuming shopping centre it's a muslim woman's best kept secret
this isn't the most glamorous of malls compared to the other forty nine shopping malls in dubai but if you want an excellent tailor made abaya this is the place to come
hi girls
the shop of the moment is sweeties run by chitra a hindu woman who's making a fortune out of muslim women's fashion if anyone is going to get me looking fabulous it's this woman what is wrong with my abaya chitra because i wore it in yemen and it was fine
this is my prized possession my manolos i got three pairs when they did they opening they actually flew in manolo blahnik and he was there himself signing pairs of shoes and i made him sign all three of mine
does the average kind of you know girl in dubai know this stuff
yes they know they know god
i'm not going anywhere without you what else
this is by matthew williamson
oh right i'm an accessory junkie
so i love it
all the riches baby won't mean anything
that kind of attention to detail happens a lot in somewhere like dubai
it is because we tend to wear the abayas a lot when we wear the abaya what shows the reason behind the abaya is basically to cover up
right so the abaya tends to sort of be boring when it's all black
big pimpin by jay z.
i'll only be window shopping though so what are we gonna do first we're going to manolo blahnik
a lot of us are huge fans of sex and the city it was only a matter of time before we actually started really wearing the hell out of these shoes
i've got the last one in the shop cos they've been selling like hot cakes wow that's pretty high squeeze my leg god
yeah it does wow
oh my god
so i guess that's the effect right you look hot it's quite an effort getting them on work it
at five hundred seventy five i don't think so
now we're going to hermes can we see the cuff there is one that has these studs in it it's to die for it's stunning
alanoud knows exactly what she wants and goes straight there no messing around this is gonna cause nothing but attention is it
that's what we're looking for what's wrong with attention
no nothing's wrong with attention how much does this cost
cuff cuff jewellery two
and now i'm going to look for a bag
amani come on let's go honestly this shop gets me high every time
so if you would recommend one of these bags that would make me dubai cool which one would you go for
i'd say this one
i suppose its doesn't matter that you can hardly fit anything in that's like secondary
course not look at it look at the colour please tell me this is not gorgeous it is i'm just a bit overwhelmed
so on average the most that you've spent how much would you say
yeah but i actually put it down a bit
i'm the least spender right ten thousand is nothing
by dubai standards that's pretty
that's nothing it's me not shopping at all
i mean you have to have them
have you heard of primark primark
no what's primark
we can go down and trade with the men but it is better for us to be on this room because we have our freedom we can laugh we can gossip we can exchange ideas
it is quite a risky game yeah it is a risky game
it is like gambling it looks like that
and what do you buy with your money
i invest in properties i live in burj dubai which is the hottest area in dubai now
yes it is it's kind of our equivalent would be somewhere like knightsbridge central london where property is very very expensive of all the places in the muslim world women here are having it all or most of it anyway most are in work and more than two thirds are doctors lawyers and accountants the emirates which dubayy is part of is a country with one of the highest numbers of female muslim m. p.'s in the world so i'm beginning to realise that this is a city where muslim women can achieve what they want and earn their own money doing it i'm off to meet someone who spent years saving two hundred thousand to buy the hottest car on the block wow nahla that is amazing twenty three year old graduate nahla al rastamani is unique she's the only muslim woman with a formula one licence in the middle east and the only girl on the united arab emirates race team even more radical when you realise in saudi arabia across the border women aren't even allowed to drive i've got to sit inside i'm sorry oh wow
knight rider theme tune
outspoken nayla isn't just talk her upcoming film is lifting the lid on a subject that's taboo in any society what's your latest project
the film it's we've really pushed it this time because the topic is very very sensitive it's about paedophilia it's about a kid who gets molested on a daily basis in her own house so it's a very creepy black and white film about this kid who walks outside meets a stranger and things happen behind closed doors and you know you get all
has being a muslim woman held you back in any way doing these kind of films no not really
because you know when it comes to me if i have something on my mind nothing will stop me nothing can stop me the only thing that will stop me is me myself if i decide that i don't want to do it then i won't do it
does it hold you back wearing the abaya and shayla
no actually it's an advantage because what happens is you strike out you're different because you wear your abaya cos they don't expect that coming from someone who is in this attire i'm dressed in all this black stuff the batman and i have to walk around and people don't understand they're like you're a film producer if i wanted to i could go ahead and wear jeans and t. shirt it's not a problem at all but it's my identity and i'm proud of it
so although nayla is pushing barriers she's still very proud to wear the abaya and she's not the only one all the women i've met are big fans and the fashion industry has caught on too as always in this city everything comes back to style this is dubayy's formula one racetrack i'm not here to watch cars racing round but to gatecrash a fashion shoot french magazine l'officiel is shooting a fashion spread for its arab edition can you tell me a bit about the concept of this shoot
quite powerful
it's very powerful it's a powerful way for a woman to dress i think that if a woman's covered it leaves more to the imagination it becomes quite mysterious it could be the way the abaya or the muslim woman goes in the future
it's really good to hear that being covered up doesn't stop people from being fashionable and it's powerful and women here have got money to spend and they are gonna spend money on high end fashion and combine it with their kind of culture and tradition it's brilliant actually what you wear under your abaya is a big deal too women here spend so much on brands that the fashion houses of paris and milan are customising their garments for muslim women who want to be modest and fashionable so you'll see designer skirts with a couple of inches added to the hem and tops with higher necklines
we have this kind of floral items from valentino and as you can see you have the short and the long version that has been done especially for us the longer version which is quite popular actually
amongst emiratis yes so basically you asked the designers to specially make long skirts because emiratis prefer the longer length
long skirts longer dresses specially all made for us for our market that's fantastic
these are christian dior scarves and you can get them in all kinds of sizes smaller but this is the perfect size for a shayla i think i'll demonstrate but i don't think an emirati lady would have hair as curly as me but if you can see it's just the right length for the shayla and it would just be wrapped round like that and maybe just tucked subtly gotta be careful cos it's christian dior but you kind of get the idea
it's very elegant on you
thank you it doesn't surprise me that international fashion houses are chasing the muslim pound but this does since this shop opened the tills have not stopped ringing it's muslim women buying this stuff they may be veiled they may be covered but they're not embarrassed incredibly this branch of agent provocateur is the highest selling in the world natalie you've been working in agent provocateur for three years so you know the local women really well what kind of things do they go for they don't wear this i mean they wear clothes under their abaya and then underwear let's get that straight cos i think lots of people in the west think that underneath the abaya arab women just wear underwear
no no
so what kind of things would they go for what kind of colours
well let's say this one
wow look at you
tonight's premiere is a big deal and like a lot of muslim women in dubayy nayla is causing a stir so this is it time for my red carpet moment have i picked the right dress am i going to be able to walk in these heels i can't believe
that was amazing
they don't have a clue who we were
no it's just it's amazing what a bit of bling can do isn't it seriously they went wild that was so much fun
december nineteen sixty six and london is swinging the new beat groups are rocking the charts hendrix has just arrived in town and a mini skirt is all the rage but tonight belongs to the old school arriving in style for the star studded premiere of their brand new film gerry and sylvia anderson their studios on the slough trading estate have become a mini hollywood and a multi million pound empire their t. v. show is an international hit their movie will be the christmas film but the real stars of the night are not people they're puppets this is all about thunderbirds how britain's favourite puppet show went from slough to the stars
five four three two one thunderbirds are go when we played at thunderbirds at school i was always scott tracy in thunderbird one and my friend was in thunderbird two at the time i didn't think it was any big deal i just said well make the trees fold back she's going
parker yes milady
our strings touched and it was like one thousand volts of electricity went through me
all the shows that we did before thunderbirds were like a dress rehearsal for the big one which was thunderbirds
just five years earlier yuri gagarin became the first man in space
i wish i was a spaceman the fastest guy alive
it couldn't come quickly enough for me there was a real sense that technology was gonna change the world and that the pace of change was unstoppable fifty years from now home for some thirty thousand people could very well be a city like this built out of concrete and glass fifteen miles out into the north sea
we're living at a time of such rapid scientific change that our children are accepting as part of their everyday life things which would have been dismissed as science fiction a few years ago
there'd be manned missions to mars everybody would be in flying cars
cars would fly and that all seemed incredibly exciting dad got a new car great does it fly
we'd have silver boiler suits you'd be able to take a pan am flight to the moon if you wanted
i wanted to be a spaceman i think every kid did gerry's shows enabled you to be those spacemen
all my thinking drew me to think of the future
when they weren't watching rocket launches kids were expected to make do with some pretty ropey puppet shows but technology was about to take over here as well
supercar
i did this with a certain amount of tongue in cheek as the years rolled by people in the business would say are you gonna make this one in supermarionation i used to think if you only knew but everybody took it very seriously like this was another form of film making supercar
it was a guy called mike mercury and he had this car that could go as the song said at the beginning through space the air along the road under the water whatever
supermarionation and supercar everything was super despite the fact gerry had never really intended to work with puppets
i had ideas of becoming what steven spielberg is today
smoke generator on
and here i was making puppet films
doctor beaker we don't seem to have any smoke
no smoke
but at least gerry's process was hi tech he'd come up with a nifty way of making the puppets' lips move
there was the solenoid which had to be put inside the puppet head which would operate the mechanism inside the mouth the current for that had to come down wires which held the puppets up
i have a suggestion let's have it quick i think what's the plan mike
well doctor beaker is gonna take the film back to satellite films incorporated
the bottom lip was hinged the chin was fibreglass but left a gap there and we had to fill that gap with something that would stretch and look as if it was part of the face the only material that worked were condoms and the boys used to have a great deal of fun going into a chemist and ordering twenty or thirty
despite supercar's advances there were still some limitations
we were able to make the puppets appear to do most of the things we wanted the things that we couldn't do was we couldn't get the puppets to walk
walking was a thing you couldn't make look natural with a puppet you have to lift their foot up and put it down and it just didn't look like a human walk
so supercar's futuristic design also served a purpose it saved the puppets having to walk around the series was bought by t. v. mogul lew grade with his investment gerry's company brought in some young special effects assistants who couldn't wait to start their own space race
i think what we were aiming for was excitement and thrills and that was our goal so everything we did was fast it was noisy it was explosions fire one roger fire one
to start off it was just a bang and a flash everyone got a lighter and supercar had two stuck up its exhaust pipes you lit it and ran and that was it if it burnt a string it fell off the fire brigade used to come out because the ceiling was alight things like that everything was a little bit trial and errorish but we learned
though supercar was good it was starting to get exciting it was still very puppety and fireball i think was the first one that took it away from that and made it sort of almost grown up
dan dare is kind of an interesting figure because he's not this incredibly futuristic sci fi hero he's actually a really old fashioned stiff upper lip lantern jawed bulldog drummond style fighter pilot a sort of biggles for the future he's very british and very old fashioned i think you see a lot of that kind of appeal in the lantern jawed gerry anderson heroes who are in some sense dan dare clones
like all young men of his generation gerry had done his national service the r. a. f. was a place of scratchy uniforms stiff upper lips and great big planes
as an r. a. f. pilot you kind of follow in the footsteps of biggles i was at manston at the time it had the longest runway in the country so it was used for emergencies if an aircraft had a fault it would be diverted to manston because it had this very long runway there were aircraft there like lancaster bombers that was a great thrill listen to what i say carefully take over at the controls
but now he was in civvy street the reluctant puppet producer was still trying to find ways of making his pilots look like the real thing
i never wanted to do what i was doing and so i was very critical of the puppets and constantly thinking why can't they do this how can we get them to do that i was desperately trying to improve them trying to make the puppets look as real as possible i was really saying to the industry look obviously i can make live action films can't i but it was all counter productive because each show was more successful than the last and so they came back and said can we have another puppet show i was trapped typecast
by now gerry was married to one of the production team sylvia tan as the programmes became more successful lew grade pumped more and more money into the studio
the main thing he did was he virtually gave me a blank cheque to do whatever i wanted to do
stand by for action
with grade's money anderson's ambition to make bigger and better shows was paying off
if they were selling a show to america then it was important that it was the latest and it was in colour
we are about to launch stingray
when we heard it was going to the states it had to get better and better
stingray stingray
although britain was still watching in black and white the next series was shot in glorious colour and instead of outer space it headed into the uncharted depths of the oceans
anything can happen in the next half hour
stingray was a vehicle and that was the main character so me and my friend played at being stingray all the time
marina
and probably like a lot of boys i did fancy marina
what are these strange enchantments that start whenever you're near
i think my brother did too
explosions under water you've seen the way that works you get the explosion the rocks are dropping down we put air lines in into the tank and it's bubbling it gives it that bubbles going up and stuff coming down you've got fish and we had to get scaled fish in the foreground and you had to tap the tank to get them to swim through shot to give it some form of realism and then all the fish flipped off out
a triumph for stingray and a further success for technicians at a british film studio for we are behind the scenes of the world famous television series stingray where skilful science deceives the eye and nothing is what it seems
stingray went into dry dock after thirty nine episodes by early sixty five lew grade was asking the andersons to create some new heroes
a brand new television series is about to be filmed the completed puppets perfect down to the smallest detail are handed to the expert puppeteers who will bring them to life on the screen
we made the pilot film as a half an hour show and i took it to show lew grade in a very loud voice he said gerry this is not a television series of course my little world collapsed i thought this is the end you know and then he walked all the way up to me and he wagged his finger right in front of my face and said this is a feature film which was wonderful he then said you'll have to make them as one hours i said fine lew but we've already shot nine episodes and we've got another three already written he said i don't care they've got to be made as an hour
each one had to be undone they had to be enlarged from about what was it twenty five minutes to fifty minutes sorry scott
and now all is ready the director has a final check and the cameras roll
go ahead john we have our first emergency call father
the fireflash mach six atomic airliner is in distress at london airport
thunderbird two will be right behind him
thunderbirds burst onto our screens on thirtieth september nineteen sixty five
when all the vehicles get launched that was the coolest bit
this whole idea that technology can make life easier that it's easier to be transported on some hydraulic lift into a rocket than just to walk there or climb a ladder
i have to hark back to the limitations of the puppets how do we get the crew to get into thunderbird two thunderbird two is a very high vehicle they can't walk let alone climb a ladder or a staircase thunderbird two rolls along the runway somebody said it's gonna be difficult because the wings will touch these trees and i just said make the trees fold back they said oh that's an idea they fitted the trees to two broomsticks and a man at the end would have a broomstick in each hand and he would just rotate the broomstick and the other one and the trees would both roll outwards
the brand new vehicles immediately took on an iconic status of their own well boys love that stuff don't they
it was when we first get a television and it was one of the first ever moving pictures i think i ever saw thunderbirds really kind of tuned in to what boys liked at the time when we played at thunderbirds at school i was always scott tracy in thunderbird one my friend was in thunderbird two you know virgil in a way as a kid i wasn't that interested in the plot i just wanted to get to the vehicles and explosions as quick as possible
the end sequence of the pilot when the plane is landing on the wheels i mean even now i go cold when i think about it
cut engines fireflash overshoot overshoot
fireflash lift port wing lift port wing cut power
apply maximum brakes they made it they made it
it was so exciting cos you realised that nobody had done this before
thanks virgil
thunderbirds was made to first feature standard when you look at the lighting the sets nothing was left to chance it was just made like a first feature film
i mean this isn't andy pandy any longer this is something very very different
the lavish models and special effects made thunderbirds the most expensive t. v. show ever made in britain and the hour long format meant it could offer much more than explosions and rescues
international rescue if only i knew their secrets
it gave it a bit more depth a half hour isn't very long if you've got a story that has a beginning a middle and an end a half hour twenty five minutes is not a long time to get all that established
and of course everything stopped for tea
international rescue lady penelope speaking
that padding gave it the extra dimension it needed these stories weren't over in a flash
you called milady
yes parker get the rolls royce we are going for a little drive
complication piled on complication it made the whole thing more suspenseful and dramatic and allowed for more interaction with the actual characters to exhibit their own personalities
the thunderbirds are not manned by just a group of rescuers they're manned by a family and you have that very important core of the stories is this is about the family they're brothers it's their father who's sending them off on these missions
sure thing dad yeah father
and so there's a very strong emotional core at the centre of the stories
well alan tintin you understand that i have to be here don't you
sure dad now if you'll excuse us tintin and i are gonna play tennis
with story with characteristics they became characters they became people you didn't think about them as puppets
i contact john in thunderbird five
scott was like the leader he had his feet firmly planted on the ground
what's up scott nothing john
just wondered how things were with you
scott is supposed to be the sort of leader of the pack aside from the old man
now hold on boys i'm still giving the orders round here
virgil was slightly artistic played the piano and painted
how do you expect me to get a good likeness if you don't keep still
and then there was lovely alan here who was the baby and spoilt
right laugh this one off
hey
alan would be a bit difficult to keep in line sometimes
gordon now listen you've got to locate them within the next two minutes
gordon spent most of his time under water john was up in the satellite
come in john international rescue from thunderbird five hi scott
it was a family and with all the ups and downs and slight aggravations at times that a family would have to deal with
say where's tintin got to gordon
don't tell me you haven't heard virgil this prince charming flew in and is really sweeping her off her feet
alan oh alan had a terrible time
knock it off eh fellas
he was actually in love with tintin
they're just friends that's all
there was a lovely naturalness to it i thought with that relationship
was he as handsome as i am gordon nearly virgil
they're overgrown kids we never forget that they're children because their dad is telling them what to do
a moment's delay could be the difference between life and death
these kids are being told to go off and pilot fantastically fast machines and go out and do exciting things it's absolute child wish fulfilment
kids empathised a lot with thunderbirds because the characters' heads are out of proportion to the body just like children i was about seven years old and we had a family holiday to morecambe and then i realised they had this thirty f. t. model of thunderbird three i resolved then to actually build my own rocket i was gonna build one of these things that charged the imagination a lot of kids grow up and they believe in magic they believe in all this harry potter stuff i wanted something more substantial i thought through science you can make it happen and very much so with thunderbirds it could be possible and it could you know give me a few billion pounds and i could build you a tracy island and we could do thunderbirds for real
i had a little thunderbird two a dinky thunderbird two where the pod came out
yeah i had one of those
thunderbird four that you always lose
absolutely right and i had a fab one the rolls royce and you always used to lose the gun cos it used to fire a gun out the front
i didn't realise when i was a kid that most of the thunderbirds machinery doesn't make sense cos what you've got is you've got these three engines here and if you've got a slight imbalance from one of these engines it's just gonna tip the rocket it would be much better if you had four engines you'd have to have a lot of guidance on there maybe a reaction control system out the front to mitigate any variations in the thrust
you know a rocket launching never fails to give me a kick
it's the hardware the gadgets the machines its wish fulfilment really for boys
where are we now these are some of the vehicles that we use
when we're out on rescue operations of course these are just some of our minor craft
this was my favourite thunderbird it had so much going on but it would be very very difficult to get this to fly one of the problems is these wings they just point the wrong way
easy does it he's down
now that's a good choice
merchandise and magazines were big business among boys the next job was to find a way of reaching girls by exploiting a minor character
international rescue come in please
come in penny
they decided they'd devote a whole magazine to lady penelope so we had a call a desperate call saying look we've invested money where is the heroine we only see her at the beginning and the end
but this was a boys' world where girls had to use all their feminine wiles
oh constable the light's in my eyes the only problem was that when the team of writers came in they never knew how to write for this new heroine so it was all boy's own stuff and the women sort of bringing the tea now i seem to be quite lost
where are you making for
well if you could direct me to the tower of london i always had a battle on my hands really to get something into the show that was more than explosions it took quite a lot of persuasion
bowing to commercial pressure penelope and parker were brought forward in the storylines adding a dash of light relief as well as glamour
just a touch of chloroform splendid at the beginning of the series parker was actually a minor character because in the credits at the end his face doesn't appear like scott's and all the others you've got the lady of the manor and you've got you know an ex convict trying to go straight
parker
yes milady and sassing her all the time i just think the juxtaposition of the two was made for comedy
get the rolls royce out parker we're taking lord silton to london
you know i've often felt i'd like to do something exciting like being a secret agent
oh at last those killers are hiding out in their sub they must be stopped
there's a sense that they're trying to get into that whole james bond scene not always that subtly there's a character in an episode called the man from m. i five called james bondson
dear me you are impatient mr. bondson
she's a sort of rogue deb a modern posh girl a very rich modern posh girl she's a sort of composite of all the early slash mid sixties girls actresses and pop people she's a bit julie christie a bit dusty springfield she's that composite sixties girl with big blonde hair and fantastically smart clothes couture but new couture
this is number seventeen called autumn crocus
they were looking very closely at real couture and copying those clothes
penelope's glamourous lifestyle and stiff upper lip perfectly suited the mood of swinging london or people's perception of it anyway
we're nearly there
theye absolutely subscribed to an american view of britishness why bother with subtleties in something like that it would be stupid so you've got posh upright brits
i say open this door at once we're british
and the dick van dykes you know working classes
jolly good show
and posh ladies
parker will have us out of here in no time
london may have been swinging but back in slough the thunderbirds team were hard at work
and so another scene in the adventures of international rescue is shot at the a. p. film studios in slough the safety town
on the slough trading estate we probably launched more rockets than anybody else in the world
derek how do you evolve the futuristic designs of your models
well usually i just start doodling on a pad as far as we're concerned nothing is impossible in special effects
it's made by people called reg and derek and yet it's deliberately projecting a completely un english un slough kind of world all sorts of glamourous things are made in unglamorous places and therefore exactly the right place to make magic a dream factory should be in slough
they were on the beloved slough trading estate a very romantic setting not far from the mars chocolate factory and in the shadow of two cooling towers not quite hollywood but the nearest thing we'd got
next stage there's a vast empire of scenic design and model making everything is custom designed and built to scale houses space ports thunderbird craft vehicles down to guns and watches'
we had everything that any other film would have there was a carpenter's workshop a puppet workshop there was a wardrobe department an editing department it was a miniature film studio a miniature industry if you like we had everything that anyone else would use when making a film
yeah i'm very destructive by nature i think that's why i'm in special effects
it was filmed in the afternoon and blown up if it didn't work the next morning when you watched the rushes you made it all again that was the routine it wasn't until you watched the rushes could you breathe a sigh of relief and say right i haven't got to rebuild that lorry that was burnt to pieces or the petrol station that was completely destroyed we hadn't had the technology that you have today we had nothing but bits of string to pull things along bits of wires to hang things on so we weren't missing the magic that today's technology has but it was more fun then
she's going
ooh those effects boys must have felt like they had the biggest train set in the world to play with nothing was impossible apart from making the puppets walk of course
it did lead to such things as the jet bikes that the thunderbird crews had which obviously was a solution it looked very futuristic and we may well have had them in the script anyway but certainly faced with the problem of getting a puppet to cross a set from point a to point b. and get them at speed as well which was the other thing then the jet bike was the obvious answer
right mcgill
he gave them a hover bike or a vehicle to go around in but that's what made it better so economy becomes a kind of a plus
you could never get a puppet to pick something up so we'd use real hands a lot of the time mine
it's not here
we'd build a little piece of set for a real hand you need hands to hold someone you care for you need hands to show that you're sincere when you feel nobody wants to know you
the rendezvous remains as arranged
didn't you hear the first time stop playing around with that pen
listen dempsey i'm hanged if i'm gonna take orders from you
we did have live alligators we had a massive tank built into our stage and we built the house that was gonna get blown up and we got these alligators they'd swim round disappear and go under the water that's when you got out of the tank
come on come and get me
alan good shooting fellas
it was wonderful we learnt the business i went there not having a clue how a film was put together and i learnt as we all did we were all very young nineteen twenty year olds and we were all brought together to play really and we were playing it was amazing
special effects were in their infancy and we were years ahead of anybody else this little studio in slough was producing some of the finest special effects in the world
as england lifted the world cup thunderbirds was the number one children's show lew grade's next plan was to move to the big screen
adventure is go danger is go thunderbirds are go now on the big screen
to make a movie of thunderbirds then in sixty six was no coincidence because it's about sixty five sixty six that interest in british films and britishness in the cinema really reaches its peak it's in sixty five sixty six that bondmania reaches its absolute highest extent with the release of thunderball
thunderbirds are go was set to be the christmas film of nineteen sixty six with a spectacular premiere in london's west end
if anyone says to me an outstanding memory of those times it would be the premiere of thunderbirds are go very very exciting we had a huge band we had everybody visiting and the fans it was just wonderful
it was nice to be having that kind of slightly lavish thing to celebrate the film itself it did us a power of good i think
there was floodlights in piccadilly circus it was wonderful
then they had the band of the royal marines on stage you know playing the thunderbirds theme i think i wore a dinner jacket
we felt that we'd arrived we did it properly it was right in the west end of london it couldn't have been better and it was a proper film premiere but they were puppets
in the foyer i stood beside lew and then he turned to me and said gerry i can't make up my mind is thunderbirds gonna be bigger than james bond well you know it was like a dream come true
a brand new adventure that takes you where you've never been before thunderbirds are go
unfortunately the picture failed
people look back at that film and say well that was the turning point for anderson's career
it's new zoom from lyons maid new zoom with three flavour stages and new picture cards start collecting famous cars there's one free with every zoom on sale now
by christmas nineteen sixty six thunderbirds had conquered the world but unexpectedly the big screen version flopped it was midway through the second season after thirty two fantastic adventures that gerry got the news that the plug was being pulled
i went to lew i didn't even think about it i was sure he was gonna say there's little to say gerry just keep on making them instead of which he said it would be easier for me to sell if i had a new series he felt he couldn't sell more episodes i think he was wrong but i allow him that
he said there was gonna be another series and it was gonna be better we thought well hang on a minute thunderbirds went to the top how can you do better than that
the finger is on the trigger about to unleash a force with terrible powers beyond the comprehension of man
i think by sixty seven things were definitely starting to change the newsweek article on london came out in nineteen sixty six we were dubbed swinging london the moment they did it that was sort of the end the following year things turned from that mood which was pop to psychedelic and swirly whirly horrible hippiedom
the new series also reflected a change of mood
the tone is set by the opening credits when you see captain black standing in the graveyard at night a friend of mine who's now forty something used to quake behind the settee whenever captain black said anything it was just that sort of frightening voice
one of you will be under our control
that really didn't come out in thunderbirds
our retaliation will mean the ultimate destruction of life on earth
thunderbirds is about saving people from themselves almost because it's people who've gotten into trouble largely through no fault of their own captain scarlet is very much about a threat
it was a darker show mainly because of the story
the planet is being threatened by these invisible aliens who can be anywhere who can do anything
there was something really quite chilling about the way that they did it you knew that person's gonna be resurrected but with his mind perverted and turned against the human cause these are quite heavy things to lay on young minds when you've been used to the jolly rousing march of thunderbirds
and the idea that anybody could be taken over by a mysteron it's the body snatchers idea which is probably the scariest of all sci fi concepts really
all the humour all the light relief all the quirky charm of the characters has gone and we've got this incredibly serious very grave and very dark world
the advance of technology continued the new show took gerry one step nearer to his dream of creating live action
physically the puppets changed they could now put the mechanism into the body so that the mouths worked and the eyes rolled so the puppets looked like much more human they needed to look that much more real for the story to work
the puppets on thunderbirds were marionettes we started to move towards live action with the captain scarlet puppets the heads were much smaller
i was very pleased probably naively because they looked like real people for the first time but they created very real problems
because the head had to be much smaller the modelling was more difficult you couldn't put so much character into the face because it was so small
although they look more real in a way they feel less real because they're not fleshed out with a private life
lieutenant green i'm outside the nash institute of technology i was just asked to do this sig captain blue it's captain scarlet speaking i'm on my way that kind of thing
proceed captain scarlet
i just did my voice i didn't really think about his character
there's not an awful lot to differentiate them apart from their colours
take it easy sig
but people liked it ah oh
the next series was in nineteen sixty eight joe ninety was aimed more squarely at children with a nine year old boy at the heart of the action
yes dad i can't wait to get to the beach
the puppets were certainly looking more lifelike than they had just six years earlier
have a nice day sir
but gerry was still longing to work with live actors so his next offering was a bizarre mix of puppets and people
good morning ah good morning
lew called me into his office and said apologetically gerry um i don't really think we can go any further with puppets i think you'd better switch to live action i managed to keep a very serious face and said well if that's what you want me to do that's what i'll do as i closed the door i went wow that's how i switched to live action
we all wanted to work with real people we all wanted to do live action we all wanted to do life size sets
they were full size sets and it was filled with people who could walk and people who could look at the right direction and when they spoke their mouths opened and closed in sync with their dialogue
interceptors immediate launch
everything was wonderful and so easy by comparison so i was absolutely delighted with it
it was a grown up world and gerry and his crew were over the moon meanwhile another dream had been realised
it's one small step for man one giant leap for mankind
before the moon landing we didn't really know what it was like this was the first time we'd ever seen like everyone else space it was actually rather dull
so in the search for adventure the only option was to send the moon itself into the outer reaches of the universe
it was wonderful to work with real actors particularly on space nineteen ninety nine we had guest stars that you would die for i remember having to design an outfit for joan collins
in the radioactive wilderness
unbelievable when i look at the design it's naff to say the least but at the time it wasn't she was incredible i've never seen a woman so beautiful her legs were extraordinary i mean this was really exciting this was film making
a million years of civilisation gone what future do we have now
space nineteen ninety nine ended in nineteen seventy seven by which time gerry and sylvia had split up and their crew had flown the nest out making their mark on the big wide world
members of that team went on to become some of the world's leading special effects men head of b. b. c. special effects for years special effects on alien special effects on indiana jones they're all kids from thunderbirds basically
the boy who loved blowing things up derek meddings created life size sets for five bond films
final rehearsal stand by
and in nineteen seventy nine was awarded a special achievement oscar for his work on superman
we had quite a good reputation when it first started it was always oh those little puppets and it got better and better and better yeah i was quite proud of them
why do them so they had to move and how great the rockets were
we thought maybe other people would share that excitement
hi penny jeff here the president's in grave danger can you look into it virgil let's go fab
after that we thought maybe if we think that's funny and there's a kind of nostalgia for it maybe other people will
what we've taken is taken that style of the puppet movement we actually do that puppet movement on stage i suppose it's a send up almost because we do it seriously that's it i did it a brand n. new formula we have three foot models of thunderbird one and thunderbird two which we wear on our heads it was almost a cult hit instantly i don't think we knew that there was that nostalgia until we'd made the show it very quickly became apparent that other people shared it
after five years the fab show moved to london's west end
thunderbirds are go
we loved it we didn't think it was rubbish it would be easy to do the terrible spoof version of thunderbirds oh the strings but actually it was great and we had a great affection for it
tonight at six o'clock thunderbirds are go once again as b. b. c. two begins a re run of the classic puppet series
now then launch pad three first make a surround which is exactly the same as the one for your pool
after it came back we noticed more children
they just got younger and younger i guess that's natural
it was always a series for children dads now brought their sons
so of course the show took on a different life
on our way madam
and another family favourite also took a leaf out of the thunderbirds handbook
i was sending up that thing especially in a close shave where wallace goes up in a chair and down the shoots and everything he gets clothed automatically and gromit just walks in through the door it's an affectionate nod really towards all that kind of stuff
these days the children of the mid sixties really are living in the twenty first century and some of them are out there designing space stations big cars and cities of the future and look what father christmas brought one thunderbirds fan
i wanted to be scott tracy i wanted to fly into space you know that was i think that's what's driving me to do this i'm actually doing this project because i love it because it's like a calling to me
twenty first century technology has also allowed thunderbirds to take on a life of its own through an invention that even gerry couldn't have foreseen
the whole appreciation of gerry's work is generational the children that appreciated it in the sixties and seventies grew up and had children and then the children saw the repeats and became fans in their turn
good king wenceslas looked out
you go to these conventions with all sorts of things going on and fathers will bring their kids fathers brought up on thunderbirds now bringing their kids along
there's a good message there in thunderbirds about saving people helping people and that is probably why that is the one show that has survived all of the others so much better because of that message
tintin look oh it's snowing
i think it's inspirational and there's not a naivety exactly but an innocence about them that again reflects the time i suppose i find that very charming i think children still relate to that certainly my son who's eleven can still watch it and there's no side issue to it it's beautiful
forty years later it's still as popular as it was when it first came out it's amazing acting is generally very ephemeral i was in olivier's company and i thought that was the pinnacle but i get much more feedback from thunderbirds
the books that we had and thunderbirds it kind of promised it to you as a boy that's what you were gonna do when you grew up and you were probably gonna look as handsome as one of those puppets as well and erm so life has been a bit of a disappointment since
only you can make this world seem bright
we got company
only

a little present to yourself i wouldn't get one from no one else
kwame insists he didn't tip us off but ford obviously thinks so his prints were all over the weapon
what is kwame's association with ford do we know
according to the mother they were good mates at school
so kwame's taking a stand or they're business partners and had a falling out nothing to prove the latter if ford's still local maybe he's got the brass to go back to his old routine he needs to earn a living
we're working on that possibility
where do junkies score on the richmond luke

fancy a game
top trumps how old are you

you're joking domestic sparrow's been harassing the neighbours again
hazelwood's a nice road hardly fridges in the front lawn
sparrow's got nothing better to do with his retirement
tell him he's never too old for an asbo that should shut him up sarge
my baby look what he's done to my baby
ah mr. duggan do you know anything about the damage to mr. sparrow's car
you lot do nothing an eye for an eye
i'm arresting you for criminal damage you do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court anything you do say may be given in evidence
i hope they don't just throw the book at you i hope they throw the whole bleedin' library
now you know what it feels like to have your most cherished possession violated jack please
she kissed me remember stop it
stop it you two had an affair merely a peck a drunken peck
she knows what she's been missing all these years you're an insecure social climber
no class no sophistication least i know how to treat a lady you could only afford the house thanks to your wife's life insurance at least she was good for something eh right that's enough
thanks for coming in how did the interview go
they said they'd let me know
is it me or is it a bit chilly in here
do you always use your friends like this
look if you don't want to do this you don't have to
i want to be a drugs referral worker not a stooge
a bit of background on the estate a bit of colour that's it it's not about pointing the finger promise absolutely to think i ever proposed you as a member of my golf club you two were friends judas drives a jag these days which you vandalised you vandalised my marriage your wife made the moves she was drunk it was a barbecue we bickered all i did was pay her some attention
a flower blossoming in front of my very eyes
i forgave her you don't reach thirty five years of marriage without hitting the odd pot hole
didn't think i'd see these four walls again so soon you still live on the richmond estate i'm looking for somewhere else but yeah
do you buy your smack there did
past tense sorry force of habit you'll find what you're looking for on coldview lane do you recognise this guy
john we said no mug shots she's not a registered chis
i left it lying on the desk by mistake
aaron ford he's the man you go to him or k. man depends who's working
thank you who's k. man
kwame kwelo they work in shifts
like a job share
they buy the stash together and split it ford works half the week k. man the other if anyone tries to take over their ground they see them off together
coldview lane is that where the money changes hands
they never carry the gear in case they get busted
and and you hand over the money they make a phone call a kid shows up on a bike and you get a bag
that's all you're getting
i'm really sorry forget it it won't happen again yeah you got that right
hey visitor to see you she is so beautiful so lovely
she's gorgeous just like her mum
thanks mac
how did the search team get on
they found some electric scales and plenty of little plastic bags in kwame's wardrobe
close but no cigar at least we know it's probably drugs related sure set up an obbo in coldview lane see if ford is back dealing but don't spend too long on this
did you not get my messages
sorry it's just been so manic
i wanted to ask you a big favour
mandy what are you doing here i popped in on the way to the health centre could i borrow the digital camera the one with the zoom lens sure
thanks don't forget the nappy bag thank you
so this favour sounds ominous
how would you feel about being ruby's godmother
you call that a favour i'd love to thank you
have you got a minute
yeah course
oh come on you know i'm only joking twinkle
will you stop calling me that
you're a star i think you might have got a code brown
i'm trying to eat here
i knew something was up when we went for dinner why didn't you say anything you've got enough on your plate without having to worry about my problems so when did this happen a few weeks ago
it was more than just a row john literally erupted i've never seen him like that before why what happened it was my fault i sent some photos of the kids to john's dad
what's so wrong with that
it's complicated don't worry about it
look at you i'm supposed to be your friend
john's dad's in prison what john went to see him first i knew about it was when he blew up about the photos said i had no right
what's he in for
john won't tell me i only found out he existed after we were married
could i have a word with you please what gives you the right to broadcast my business
i wasn't gossiping i'm worried about you
you're supposed to be on my side
i don't mean to pry but then don't
sorry
this might not be the best moment but timing was never my thing what will you be ruby's godfather
you don't want me as your daughter's moral compass i'm not sure which way north is myself any more
come in
there's not enough evidence on the inglis abh case to prosecute
word in the canteen is you've been making donations to suspects
there's no law against being nice unless you know something i don't
grand gestures tend to backfire especially when the suspects allege that the money is in fact payment in lieu of something else
hang on i gave away a fiver for a birthday cake
and what would an objective observer make of such a transaction in custody i wonder
so what file a complaint bind and gag me in red tape
no need you're so sloppy it's only a matter of time before you hang yourself with it
i've come to pick my husband up from custody jack duggan
has he been released
i don't know what the form is in situations like these i don't know anything about anything any more i'll get you an update
let's go in here
no sign of ford
check the kid on the bike yeah cut him off at the other end
jack used to be area manager for a distributions company two hundred employees to boss around now he makes do with me
my dad found retirement difficult too
he gets so angry terrified he's been thrown on the scrap heap i've just make it worse it was a drunken kiss jack's convinced himself my indiscretion was all keith's doing he wouldn't ever stop to consider whether he might be responsible for pushing me away
maybe you could try counselling
my marriage is a rotting corpse my dear it wasn't until we retired i noticed the flies just the two of us with hours to spare
why don't you just leave him
and do what go where
what about keith out of the frying pan into the fire no
i've missed the boat the only way out of my marriage is in a box
you'll both be required to attend a magistrate's hearing
did you two really want criminal record next to your names drop the charges go to mediation or something
over my dead body don't tempt me
i appreciate it's your policy to prosecute but the xbox has been returned to you i can assure you wayne will not set foot in your shop again thank you if you could pop in at some point we'll take your withdrawal statement thanks
for the benefit of the tape i'm showing mr. westwood exhibit g. b. seven a suspected controlled substance
we both know it's heroin question is who supplied it
sorry i can't help you there you were about to pass it on says who
do you know this guy
no know what i think
i think you're just the leg man we both know who runs that spot ford
how's kwame
do you know him
he's a mate of mine good mate he needs your help right now
give us ford
no comment
at least let us search westwood's bedsit he only had a gram on him what's the point the point is he might be hiding ford there
you really think ford's that stupid win some lose some give it up john
fine let's all just sit around scratching our backsides instead
other cases are piling up on your desk
maybe we should just concentrate on the easy ones beef up our targets earn you a pat on the head from the command team
does do not feed the lions mean anything to you
you saw westwood he's teetering on the edge of giving us ford
where are you going give him a push
all right drugs that's a new one
i applied for the prime minister's job but they said i was over qualified
i'm serious
you don't know what aaron ford's like he don't give you a choice
so why hang around with him
do you know what it's like to be on your own you against the rest of the world some of us prefer it that way aaron looked out for me when i left the home i owe him
it's a slippery slope they'll suck you in o. k. then
be honest bad and happy or good and alone
doesn't matter what i think
didn't think so
look the shoplifting and assault charges have been dropped
you're a top bloke you know that knock knock
who do you want me or him
we're going to see how kwame's doing fancy tagging along
i don't know
you said he was a good mate come and see how he's doing may i have a word inspector
wayne's in custody he can't go anywhere
i had to rugby tackle him during his arrest i think he might be showing signs of delayed concussion come off it stick it in the custody record we'll take him down the hospital no one's any the wiser wayne's not going to tell us where ford is if he sees the state kwame's in he's hardly singing like a canary now seeing what ford's done to his mate might prick his conscience
i'll pretend we never had this conversation
i'm not the bad guy ford's the one peddling drugs tearing lives apart like miranda's
what's going on what does it look like what about us
top speed
hundred and sixty one one hundred and sixty nine
read it and weep sucker
you should take it easy pal here sit up a bit looks well nasty
you think you know someone your whole life
who's this your mate aaron

he's still insisting he didn't tip us off claims he lost his mobile
the d. c. i.'s going to go up the wall don't worry i'll make sure he knows it was my idea
what have they got you in for
the usual the police are saying it was aaron attacked you
it was but don't tell them that
you going to sort him out yourself
i'm retiring from the drugs game not worth it blood don't blame you
aaron's off his nut these days like you'd grass up your best mate
someone's set me up
don't worry i got my ears open
not a pretty sight is it we can't keep a copper by kwame's side forever if you don't help us we can't help him
if i tell you where ford is you forget the drugs you found on me
best we can do is a caution
he's under the bridge by the supermarket
did ford supply you with the drugs this afternoon yeah you prepared to put that in a statement ford can't get you if he's in custody

in two thousand two living the dream followed the darar family when they left their home in scotland to start their dream business in spain
you think it's nice uh huh
opening an indian restaurant on a limited budget certainly had its challenges
why didn't you explain that on monday when you said you'd have the money for us here on thursday
i only realised this last night
you've not been honest pritpal that's why you can't look me in the face i've had four weeks and nothing but aggravation from you
six years on and pritpal and his wife neelam have just opened a more up market restaurant la diva the fact that it's their second restaurant isn't making it any easier
pritpal has already sold his pizza and pasta bar in ayr town centre where he worked seven days a week his wife neelam is bored of her job in a local bookshop along with their children sashkia and rohan they hope to escape the cold and damp of ayr and start a new life on the spanish costa blanca pritpal and neelam darar are looking forward to the challenge
we've always talked about emigrating at some point in our lives i think most people do you know and it's um it's just the right time to do it it's just the right time to do it
we missed our connecting flight from london it was just a long day it's been a long day but finally we're here
i just want to go home now we just want to go home now
home is now just half an hour's drive away in the tourist resort of flamenca beach
this is where the fun starts this is the fun bit
until the restaurant opens any money that pritpal and neelam spend will be eating into their capital as well as living expenses they are already paying out seven hundred euros a month on the restaurant four hundred euros a month for their hire car and six hundred sixty a month on a local purpose built villa
yay yay
it's nice come on then
it's warm how's that that's nice do you like it sash uh huh you like it dad look it's the beach i know that's the mediterranean sea over there wicked
it's identical wherever you look i won't be able to find it it all looks the same
pritpal's restaurant will be situated in flamenca beach commercial centre it's still under construction but pritpal believes it has huge potential now he can finally show it to his family
it's lovely see there's loads of kids it looks lovely come on this is number eight and voila this is it here
it's got no toilet it's not done yet darling
it's not done yet
with only limited funds available pritpal needs to have the restaurant opened in just five weeks despite his lack of experience he'll be overseeing the building work himself he'll be relying heavily on his ex pat builders david and eric they moved to spain four and a half years ago and are well qualified for this particular job
what you think of the restaurants that are here
the indian restaurants i'd go down to ganesh near popeye's
oh aye i go in there but it's the onion bhajis are flat
all the english here as soon as they have a beer let's get a curry now and now they can especially here lots of brits live here don't they
to our surprise we found out that
there is no school
first of all there is no school places left so we're now in a situation where we don't have no confirmed places for rohan or sashkia to start school or dates
pritpal and neelam had been told that finding schools wouldn't be a problem it's a distraction pritpal doesn't need he already has his hands full trying to manage a project and keep it on schedule
i've got a ceiling coming in
yeah the thing is
when
i dunno probably two weeks
the laid back spanish approach to life and deadlines is threatening to become a problem with the end of the summer holidays looming pritpal and neelam need to resolve the school situation quickly
how long will it take how long will it take
they decide to investigate the fee paying option
you'll either be in this one or that one
they're already paying out a total of one thousand eight hundred euros a month for the restaurant the house and the hire car the school fees for rohan and sashkia would come to an additional one thousand four hundred euros a month an expense which they haven't budgeted for
it's the cost element of it that's all it is it's the cost element
i don't want to send them there and then three months down the line we're having problems with paying the fees and having to pull them out and put them into school here
but there's been a mix up the building society hasn't even received his application
i spoke to the building society's manager and he's informed me that just two faxes would resolve the situation so he says he has to speak to his secretary and find out all the facts and when he's able he'll get back to me that was it i mean i told him that i'm not happy
for neelam the hold up comes as no surprise
he always has ideas and i'm always like oh but what if this happens i'm always thinking of the negative side where he's always more positive it was the same with the schools when we were talking about it last night he was like they'll just go to that school it'll be fine we'll manage but i'm like how are we going to manage but he just thinks oh go for it and somehow it'll happen
how are you doing all right
no nothing major nothing major um what's happened there's been a delay in payments eh
so it's no money today you promised us some money this morning i did so we could buy more materials
i can give you something but it's not what you guys were expecting
so the money is guaranteed it's guaranteed yeah yeah yeah
how many free meals will we get out of this
all it is is just an extra so three or four days' delay yeah yeah just a delay
pritpal's loan application has finally made it to the building society if he's to keep the project going and the builders happy he needs the money now
without the money from the loan pritpal and neelam's dream of a restaurant in the sun will be over if they can't secure the loan quickly building work will have to stop
hi good evening i'm phoning up just an inquiry regarding a loan please
pritpal phones around desperately to find another lender
yes hello is that black horse finance yes hi there i'm just making an inquiry
with no success as a last resort he's forced to approach one of his relatives for the money
how are you doing it's pritpal listen i've come to a tricky situation here
hiya how are you doing
later that evening with the promise of money on its way pritpal searches out the builders to reassure them
so what are you doing here then come in to see you guys why
ah i've come in to see you
do you mean you want to see how the other half live
just to see what you get up to when you're not working oh aye
oh we go out with the family that's good
we used to drink pints but we're only drinking halves now because
wahey i love you pritpal i love you baby
gi'us a kiss i love you pritpal have you got any baby oil
a week later and pritpal is still waiting for the money to be transferred into his spanish account the builders haven't been paid for two weeks and are beginning to lose confidence in pritpal
what's happening nothing got some good news for us today
things are being sorted out are they aye i told you they would be
well you said you was gonna get another loan they refused one loan you was gonna get another loan
the second one is the one that's on its way now as we speak
so you've got the money now i've got the money it's in england and it's getting transferred on monday
i've got money for you today it's not a problem
right give us the rest of the balance of the money and we will have that job done within nine days
you just said next friday what you've done now is now we have to work another week wondering whether we're gonna get paid
within nine days tops
with pritpal spending every available moment down at the restaurant neelam and the kids are left to amuse themselves back at the house
what are you looking at rohan
pardon what are you looking at
we've been here nearly a month i think it was a month yesterday or something and i'm getting really bored i miss school and just everybody there my teachers and everyone i didn't think i would miss them because when i went all my friends were crying but i was just like oh bye goodbye i just couldn't wait to get here but now i'm really missing them mum was upset she was crying the other day yeah i got really upset once i miss them all so much
so far the dream is not living up to expectations it's monday morning and pritpal is still waiting for the money to make it into his account the builders have not been paid for nearly three weeks they're owed a total of four thousand six hundred euros
where we left off last week right the money was the money is here
yeah brilliant so
what we agreed on four thousand euros yeah
and when are you gonna give us the six
well once the job's done
yeah i mean that's fair enough david eh yeah
work carries on but pritpal has lost the goodwill of the builders they were hoping he'd reward their patience by giving them the six hundred euros they're still owed much to sashkia's relief it's the start of term despite the cost pritpal and neelam have decided to send her to private school
sashkia darar
that's it bye have a nice day bye you're not crying are you no other parents are crying apart from you
with their money fast running out rohan will have to wait for a place at the local state school the restaurant is over budget and behind schedule but at least sashkia's mood has improved she's had a good first day at school
let's hear your spanish
they'd go como esta blah blah blah como estas and then you'd go em fatal which means terrible and then you go fatal
fatal fatal clap your hand here
fatal fatal
and the teacher's like no no no onto your forehead rohan see this fatal
back at the unit the atmosphere is increasingly tense pritpal has asked the builders to do extra work not covered by their original quote but they are unsure whether pritpal will pay them the original two thousand euros
you can't expect us to be here for another two weeks without getting any money no way
no but you told me last monday it would take you nine days
yeah to finish what we priced for yeah i'll tell you what we'll do what we've said so when we've done that in there three cases to be fitted that's it then we'll renegotiate then yeah for all the extras give us the six hundred euros take the money out for the paint all right give us whatever's left of that and that's us up to date no yes yes yes and then we'll renegotiate for all the tiling and everything and all the extras then we'll come back we'll give you a price then we'll start our other job then we'll come back when we can to do the extras we've got to start another job pritpal we're not having all this messing about there's no messing all this arguing over money holding money back we want the money it's as easy as that nobody works for nothing you know
pritpal agrees to give the builders their two thousand euros but he knows neelam will not be pleased ever since the bankruptcy she's been terrified of getting into debt
i honestly thought it was going to end up being a lot cheaper than it's been er so we've gone quite a bit over budget
no i mean going back before we came out we did some figures etc and we budgeted around about twenty to twenty five k. sterling
i just don't like the thought of being in debt
hopefully of course
later that night pritpal and neelam sit down to work out exactly how much they have spent the news is not good
me and neelam were up last night working out the costs and how much we've got left to open up etc and we've just gone way over budget again i told the builders i'd pay them about two thousand five hundred euros this weekend this week so here they come so i'm just gonna have to tell them that it's just the spiralling budget costs etc morning guys morning right listen before we start you better come over here eric right i was up all night last night working out my costs i can't pay you guys the two thousand five hundred euros until after i open up it's all these extra costs the ceiling doors and just bits and pieces
so you've got nothing at all for us why did you say you had the other day then
well i sat last night i was working out my budget especially with this quote i've had for the ceiling now
that's a terrible thing to do i've got no money for you lads
what did you want me to say why didn't you explain that on monday
when you said you'd have the money on thursday or friday morning
i only realised this last night that's why i'm telling you now rather than finishing
why didn't you tell us last night why didn't you phone david last night what at two in the morning
why did the penny drop at two in the morning
the cost of the ceiling i worked out all my figures
what so the ceiling has took the lot
it's the stock and all that i'll have to buy as well
you've not been honest with us pritpal that's why you can't look me in the face
i am looking at you in the face no you haven't been honest
that's the worst thing you can do not be honest i've had four weeks and nothing but aggravation from you
the builders decide that unless pritpal gives them one thousand six hundred euros they'll walk off the job
pritpal and neelam are up to the limit on all their credit cards they have no more money and need to be open and earning within a week
yeah the builders are sorted out and i've just gone off them completely i don't feel like talking to them either
it's the builders' last day on the job the restaurant is ten days behind schedule but at least work can now start on the ceiling
it's finished that's it we're off
good riddance cheers lads spot on to all our hard work
hot medium medium
yeah it's good to be back in business again
it's great to get a decent meal a scottish one from an indian superb
is that all is that all he says is that it is that just the drinks huh where's the food told you i'd do it i know i know told you i would do it eh
by the end of diva's first season pritpal has cleared his debts taken on eight staff and expanded on to the terrace with fifty new seats
so i can't complain it has been good
but his success has been hard earned after seven months in business pritpal's still waiting for his first day off
yeah since i've been open i've been working seven days a week and i haven't really had time to take off but i'm hopeful in the future the next couple of months that i'll be able to take time off i'm training the staff up so hopefully i'll be in a position in a couple of months
until pritpal can trust his staff neelam sashkia and rohan continue to spend their evenings alone
pritpal would love to be here he'd be right in there he's just a kid at heart he'd love it he feels he's missing out as well actually cos he would like to do all this with the kids as well but at the moment it's just not possible
the hardest thing i've had to deal with is not working seven days it's the fact that i've got to think ahead and train the staff and make sure they know what they're doing so i can get peace of mind when i take a day off
the family can finally call spain home as they move into their new house in dehesa de campoamor just ten minutes from diva for the last year pritpal has worked every single day but tomorrow it's sashkia's birthday pritpal's going to take his first day off
i won't be on standby at all i don't plan to go into work at all tomorrow or anything no phone calls or nothing tomorrow it'll be a day off totally from work
it'll be great to have pritpal home for the whole day spend some time with the family
so what if something happens usually you say emma has to deal with it and then sometimes you have to deal with it so what happens with that
hopefully nothing like that will happen if there's a complaint outside emma will deal with it like she always does
yeah but sometimes she has to call you but she won't usually when you're there sometimes she has to say pritpal can you come out
that won't happen she's going to have to deal with it herself she's going to have to deal with it herself
for your first night off first night off
meanwhile for the first time without pritpal the night at the restaurant begins
i don't want people to sit down for their meal and an hour later they're still waiting for their meal to go out it's happened before in the past but that's because we've had big tables in hasn't it and there's been no starters that's the worst scenario that might happen
thank you
should come more often
stop it what do you mean stop it behave yourself stop embarrassing me
happy birthday dear sashkia happy birthday to you
we all want some
one hundred sixteen covers later the staff have pulled out the stops for pritpal it's been another successful night
best not be good evening diva restaurant emma speaking how many i help you
can i make a reservation please
you want to make a reservation when for sir i knew you couldn't last i bet you've been sat there thinking oh my god are they all right your restaurant is still standing still there the kitchen boys are absolutely over the moon made up cos they coped
when's your next day off
next day off next year
no no hopefully it'll be more regularly now yeah
pritpal now takes two days off every week to spend with neelam sashkia and rohan but he's already dreaming about his next venture it's five years on and pritpal and his family are still living in the affluent spanish suburb of dehesa de campoamor the darars are very much settled into the local spanish way of life
sometimes if i meet someone for the first time they don't realise i'm not spanish and then after about ten minutes they'll be like you're not spanish are you no where are you from you speak such good spanish
all the spanish that i speak is just through my contacts through my suppliers day in day out that's the only spanish all the staff you've got
they picked it up within a year didn't they because
it's amazing how much you can pick up so quick
if you move to spain you have to make an effort to speak spanish
i think it's important to make an effort and for me personally i think in order for me to establish and expand our business i have to be able to speak spanish better in order for me to advance
both sashkia and rohan are still studying at their private school in the nearby town of murcia sashkia is taking the spanish baccalaureat and hopes to study medicine at a spanish university
i like everything about spain' i like the people i like the climate i like the beach i love the weather everything but i love the people the most because they're just so friendly when i think of britain it's a different world i don't feel that i belong there anymore it feels as if it was so long ago that i was there and how much i've changed since i've been here
the family's indian restaurant diva is still doing well pritpal has replaced his old manager emma with former waitress elaine
elaine's doing a fantastic job she knows what i expect from her and she does she delivers time and time again
he has trustworthy staff that have been with him from the start working in the kitchen and now pritpal only needs to visit diva every two weeks to discuss the accounts and general running of the restaurant with elaine
pritpal's mellowed over the last four five years really he listens more he's always there if you need him at the end of a telephone
is that better than last year yeah
all his hard work has paid off and the place is virtually running itself
having achieved his dream of opening an indian restaurant in spain pritpal has recently opened a new international restaurant in the affluent resort of los alcazares twenty kilometres down the coast he was quick to spot the potential of the area
thirty three
thirty three's this one spanish table we've got italian food we've got mediterranean food we've got a bit of spanish food as well we've got indian food we've got malaysian food we've got thai food we've got mexican food you know it's like a fusion of different parts of the world
pritpal embarked on la diva hoping to avoid his previous pitfalls
basically i approached the main contractor i said this is what i want and you do it and that's it that's what i did i thought it'll be easier for me
what he hadn't bargained for was the contractor finishing the restaurant five months late and without all the paperwork in place
we had problems with the town hall and the paperwork and in the summer everyone takes their holidays and you can't get things done as much as you want i don't have my own water supply yet i've had to resort to speaking to one of my neighbours so basically i'm paying him for the use of his water as well which is not an ideal situation it's not we were five months late in opening as you can imagine that had quite a dramatic effect on us as a family
what i've found is we've opened one restaurant it just settles down and then he's keen to do something else i just want when we've got time to ourselves and we can relax we don't have to worry about business i'm more keen on investing in property because basically you buy the property and it's less of a headache
although we went through a lot opening the second one it was different to the first one we went through a totally different as the dust settles again for the second one neelam's saying never again we'll never do it again but i would like to open up something else i would but it's convincing neelam i wouldn't do it if neelam said no i wouldn't do it if neelam categorically said no she doesn't want it she's saying no now but as the dust settles she could change her mind i'll persuade her to change her mind
if you wanted to open another restaurant i'd like that i wouldn't stop them i don't mind if they want to it's fine
something deep down in me is wanting me to open up a chain of restaurants
but for now not having a water licence at la diva means pritpal and neelam live in fear of being closed down by local council investigators
this is what our neelam and i.'s biggest concern is the fact that a representative from the town hall can come in at any time and ask for all my paperwork they can come and say show me this and we won't have it every time i hear something i just automatically glance out the window do we have staff coming in no
to make matters worse the temporary water supply is only available at night when the restaurant is open even though pritpal applied for his licence two years ago well before opening he's still no nearer to getting it
spain's great to do business in but everybody will say the same it's just manana manana and it doesn't get any better i think where we are just now the mar menor area it's a small town mentality here it's frustrating at times it is frustrating what i have learned is that there's no point shouting at them or doing anything or showing your anger towards them because they'll just blank you out and that's it
pritpal has been advised to use a lawyer to deal with his water problems
hopefully we'll get it resolved fairly soon i've got a meeting with my lawyer he's on holiday just now so he comes back next month and i'll be urging him to get it done very very quickly
while the small town mentality continues to frustrate pritpal the bright city lights and business opportunities of barcelona are a welcome distraction pritpal manages to persuade neelam to accompany him on one of his restaurant scouting trips
i've been to barcelona three times in the last fourteen months and every time i go i just get even more excited about it
ah look at it
wow look at the size of that and they've boiled it in water wow
it's horrible i've never seen this before pritpal look
wow it's so nice have you ever tried one of these
never
mini avocados never seen them before never seen them wow so much choice you never see it here it's like a green
even the green chillies are difficult to get where we are
indian foods some of the dishes are quite spicy and you use green chillies i can never get a good strong green chilli there because you've got all this variety again you can do so much and it's really amazing it really is it gets me excited they're coconuts
dos cafe con leche dos cafe con leche
gracias
there's just the tension again of starting up somewhere else again more than anything else pritpal would say i'm pessimistic i always say i'm not i'm realistic more than pessimistic he's always optimistic about everything he never thinks that anything can go wrong
i think i can apply my experience and neelam's as well you know here put it to good use get a nice location get it set up similar to la diva if not better i don't have a problem with any ingredients got everything here staff i don't think i'll have a problem with and that's half of the battle and then that's it so it's appealing it's very appealing
every time you open a business in spain there's a lot of paperwork there's a lot of headache and it takes a lot of your time then he has to start working in the restaurant training up staff again it causes a lot of tension and he doesn't have much free time
neelam's had she doesn't want to do it again but she said that after the first time as well yeah i would like to open up a chain i would because i think we've got a formula that works
i've always seen the potential that's the thing and i know if we did have a restaurant here it would do really well but it's just the hassle of it that i'm worried about
pritpal returns to some bad news his neighbour who's been supplying la diva with its temporary water supply has decided it's too risky to continue at the end of their shift he has to tell neelam what's going on
he says he's going to stop the water
what did you say to him
i said i'm trying to get it resolved as soon as possible with the town hall but he said it's too risky he doesn't know the situation right regarding the town hall so to him although he's helped us out he feels that he doesn't want to any more he doesn't want to help us out with the water any more
there's nowhere else we can get it i know that's why i need it done this week
i can maybe stretch him out for another week that's why i need to get it done as soon as possible it's not going to happen this week i know neelam it's not going to happen this week i know that but like i say i can maybe get another week out of him or something
this is definite that's it
yeah that's what he said
why is it all of a sudden going to be risky i don't know i don't know
just now we're operating with a temporary supply of water it's not an ideal situation it's not the way i would like to run a business but at the end of the day you know i've got mouths to feed i've got school fees to pay a mortgage to pay this is causing me too much stress neelam as well it's causing us both stress i need my water certificate sorted out as soon as possible
the day after hearing the bad news from his neighbour pritpal goes to see jose carlos his lawyer
i will be kicking ass i'll tell him that i want to see something and get something done i want to see some results
jose carlos has been working on pritpal's case for six months now but is a difficult man to pin down
answerphone message in spanish hello jose carlos it's pritpal here from la diva in los alcazares i spoke to your secretary regarding the meeting with the town hall i need this meeting with the town hall done as soon as possible with the mayor please because we have to get things moving very quickly
i think we should change lawyers because i think this lawyer's far too laid back and it's got to the stage where we need to get things moving quickly and he just doesn't seem to be doing anything about it
with the threat of closure looming pritpal and neelam try and find another lawyer
we don't know your number if you want an appointment
was it not mr. alvarez's practice is this his office i don't know
there is no mr. alvarez
hello hi sorry to bother you again
i know you're probably busy that's o. k. you know mr. alvarez yes when was the last time you spoke to him
i just phoned the office and she said he doesn't work there any more
oh yeah that's what we thought
pritpal phones carlos his long term engineer to see if he can help with the permissions
the following day the elusive jose carlos is back in his los alcazares office and with just days to go before the neighbour's deadline pritpal and neelam finally get their meeting
because there's been no decision we're assuming they want other information but what we don't know what they want
the engineer has spoken to them and he said he provided them everything they wanted everything
i'll pay you whatever it costs i want you to go to the town hall every day if you have to and get this thing sorted out i don't care how much it costs i need it sorted out carlos please what do you think the problem is in your opinion what do you think why are they not giving us the decision why
it's been nearly two years
yes i know you can't have holidays for two years
that can't be your excuse you know the town hall must answer you
this is what the law says in three months not much more time but the law gives you the opportunity to go to the court
pointless it's pointless taking the town hall to the court you know
there is a problem because they're foreign people because all the courts are collapsing there are a lot of cases and this takes a lot of time
but that's not going to help our situation it's not going to help that's not going to do anything
pritpal and neelam never heard from jose carlos again
pritpal decides to visit the town hall yet again it's his twentieth visit
i'm sick and tired of coming here and trying to explain to them that it's been so long you know basically all i want is a straightforward answer i've just provided you with all the information you've ever wanted but they just take so long coming round to it and giving you a decision but you know that's spain for you
pritpal has brought along one of his waiters janel who speaks good spanish
one thing that became apparent in the first season was that we were going to have a global reach
and season two is no different with the show spreading its wings even further around the globe introducing new characters from far and wide
save the world
we decided at the beginning of the season to expand on the idea that this was a global phenomenon it wasn't like it just came out of left field hiro came from japan and suresh from india but we really wanted to more embrace that sort of thing at the start of season two we introduced two latino characters who were on the run and had a mysterious and terrifying power who are they why are they in the story what is happening these are the questions we wanted the audience to ask
a couple together then over your shoulder just the sense that you're being chased
so who are these twin heroes dania ramirez had already appeared in another hit t. v. show let's just say she was very well connected
woke up this morning went and got yourself a gun she had been on the sopranos she was also in x. men and we knew our writers loved the work that she had done on the sopranos we knew of many roles that were similar that were out in pilots and we knew we needed to move fast on this so we got her in quickly for the producers and tested her and she won them over immediately
i was really really lucky cos they thought of me and all i had to do was not mess it up
casting shalim ortiz as maya's brother alejandro was less straightforward
dania's from the dominican republic we saw hispanic actors from mexico it's a very different culture and it's a very different accent we tried to base a lot of it on acting ability first but for dania the dialogue needed to be correct
that was a big issue you're somebody's brother but you have a competely different accent
not only did shalim have to sound right he had to look the part too
dania is so spectacular looking that you know we had to step up to make sure her brother was equally good looking
got a black magic woman i wanted to create a character who had very dark power but was not themselves dark i liked the tension of that she's a black magic woman she's trying to make a devil out of me
the idea was to try to embrace something that we hadn't done before which was twins who had a very sympatico kind of power notice i used spanish for that
huh
and a little known fact is that tim is a twin so that he very much understood that counterbalance between two characters it's kind of lethal
i see a red door and i want it painted black
maya emits like the plague pretty much
i want it to turn black
i don't think it's got a name black eyes
we wanted the transition to be fast and they're into it and so we ultimately ended up with just something simple which is that their eyes fade to black and become very similar to isaac's eyes in the first season when he was seeing the future only black
which would then stain her face and not be consistent from take to take the actress we just she had to cry that poor actress had to cry for the whole season
i cry i mean i'm an actress that's all we do you have to cry you cry
i'm all cried out you took a whole lot of loving the c. g. i. guys would capture her real tears and turn them black and that looked very realistic it ended up being the best and most consistent effect
and it looks friggin' cool
we wanted to make it look hot and we took these two extremely beautiful actors and covered them in dirt and sweat and then added more dirt so dania who is just ridiculously beautiful in real life was just constantly covered with sweat and dirt and grime but you know we wanted it to be very textural
maya and alejandro are running around like crazy people most of the time so you know we had to make sure that their wardrobe was appropriate with the temperature which was really warm and what they were gonna have to go through
i don't take a lot to get ready cos if you see maya most of the time she's just dirty
uh it was really hot really hot there were days there was a day that it was definitely like one hundred five one hundred seven degrees we were all dragging
one of the most challenging locations for season two was the journey maya and alejandro make from the dominican republic up to the border and on into new york trying to find doctor suresh because it covers so many different topographies whether they're coming out of the jungle and then they're in these dusty kind of central american towns and we stumbled across a couple of areas over in east los angeles that were really quite astonishing i'm a native of l. a. and i was thrilled to find these places i'd never seem 'em they were quite convincing the whole foot chase with the police chasing them it really came off well
that was one of the things that was a disappointment to me cos i thought i was gonna get to mexico
but you would never guess that the location for the tropical beach scenes was actually the trusty heroes studio car park
where am i
we're in maui nice huh feel those trade winds
when we were on the beach the first time you see my character this season was in the parking lot here at the studio with a big blue screen and some sand it was cool to see how they brought it to life so none of this is real show me what's really going on here
honey you really don't wanna know
show me
what we ended up doing for this particular sequence which we really broke down into two pieces the part on the beach and the part in the shack
get down get down
jungle boogy
ah yeah
jungle boogy
my first day back
so why did it take so long for sylar to scuttle back onto our screens
i think the reason why we didn't reintroduce sylar into the story until episode three is so that the fans'd think he really died
he looks dead
i'm almost hit by a car in the middle of nowhere that just happens to be going back to new york to see suresh it's perfect
but things are far from perfect for the now powerless sylar
help me
peter and sylar were both so powerful at the end of season one that on a purely practical level it sort of led you to a land of big giant cataclysmic special effects every week which were unfeasible for us practically and also ultimately not that interesting because as always we're about character
he's freaked out that he doesn't have his powers i can't make it move that cup i used to be able to make things move with my mind
when you strip a villain of their power some of the base nature of who they are starts to show up
everything that i've been working for everything that i had it's gone
we were always really fascinated by the gabriel gray aspect of who sylar was and we're gonna get to kind of explore that clearly he's on a quest to regain his former glory and so that's what volume two is watching that slow march back to being sylar
i don't even know your name
it's gabriel
ominous echo
when he calls himself gabriel in that episode it's with um he realises that he's not who he was who he became who he wants to be gabriel gray yeah it's a sad moment for him
like the angel
yeah just like the angel
i love zac he's so subtle in the way that he does it it's not necessarily so physical as much as it is a look it's an aura it's so weird because not every actor can actually do that can go from smiling with their eyes to you know i'm going to kill you you know all in like half a second
i try to be aware of that when i'm in scenes i mean that's sort of another level another layer of this character's psychology
what a wicked game to play to make me feel this way
i think she's intrigued by him where are you going
i'm going home to america new york
new york this is where we're going there's so much honesty in the way that he just stares at her
i know doctor suresh we're old friends you and doctor suresh you've helped me now i can return the favour i can take you to him i can help you find him she looks to him for protection guidance um and he takes advantage of that fully
we didn't mean to hurt anyone
well you can tell the police that because derek is calling them right now
no no no please no he cannot
maya
what are you doing to me he becomes sort of absorbed into that relationship it becomes a triangle you both have power
this is not our fault we don't know what's happening to us
that's why you need to find doctor suresh
yes
he clearly found in both of them a chance to um it's a meal ticket basically it's a ride to where he wants to go
believe me i understand what you're going through to be held responsible for things that you didn't mean to do being hunted i've helped suresh with many people like you he'll know what to do they need him now because he knows and he has the power to ruin them so he just turns it around for his own gain
help the police
they have to catch us first
does maya see through sylar's wicked game
this programme asks current experts and diplomats richard dowden lord hurd and sir bernard lovell were their predictions right panorama started with one of the biggest changes to world governance the end of colonial rule in africa
robin day reports
well i think obviously one africa is committed to the achievement of complete independence from colonial rule and i think this next decade should be the decade in which we should really get the whole of africa free
well by the end of the decade most of africa was free the portuguese stayed on in angola mozambique and guinea bissau but france britain and spain all pulled out of their their african possessions and er it was it was just the portuguese colonies and of course south africa and rhodesia which where white rule still prevailed and the rest of africa was independent by nineteen seventy
i think most people in the foreign office recognised that nyerere was right when he said that independence was coming it was inevitable i think the colonial empires no longer had either the will or the means to hang on to colonies in africa against the will of the people there
the main external power driving the british was america they had lent britain a great deal they suddenly called in the debt now and a part of the price of actually then lending britain more money was that it should give up its empire the war in algeria had already started against the french the british had had a taste against of it against mau mau in kenya this uprising in kenya and their choice was very simple you either shoot or you get out
harold macmillan britain's prime minister famously summed up the prevailing mood just a few weeks later at south africa's parliament in cape town
the most striking of all the impressions i have formed since i left london a month ago is of the strength of this african national consciousness it is happening everywhere the wind of change is blowing through the continent
i don't know why he chose cape town i mean it was it seemed quite bizarre if he'd made it in any other african capital he'd have been cheered and and it was the one place where he got a really really bad reaction and of course it took another thirty four years before south africa actually became free anyway
several months later the south african government showed the world the lengths it was prepared to go to in order to hold onto power richard dimbleby introduced the story for panorama that march
from time to time in history the name of an insignificant place burns itself into the memory of mankind simply because of something that happened there places like guernica and lidice and belsen hola and little rock and today there may well be another sharpeville near johannesburg in south africa more than sixty africans including women and children were killed and more than one hundred seventy were injured a week ago today when the police opened fire on a crowd estimated at twenty thousand which had surrounded sharpeville police station the shootings happened during a demonstration against the so called pass laws the hospitals of sharpeville are still dealing with the injured already the united states government has officially regretted what it called a tragic loss of life and this week the security council will discuss the shootings
robin day also interviewed white south african's who were living in london
some people seem to think the police shot down innocent demonstrators peaceful demonstrators well anyone who's seen a crowd of natives or africans in south africa peacefully demonstrate will never forget it it's an unforgettable sight i can assure you how did you feel about the british and world reaction to the sharpeville shootings last week
i don't think the police could have acted any other way and for that reason i think the reaction was very very strong
without having been there it's difficult for anyone to say do you think the use of sub machine guns was necessary
what else could he have done in these circumstances to get himself out of the police station admittedly he could have fired a warning volley beforehand which he didn't do as far as i can see there was no alternative to open fire as quickly as he could i feel there's going to be a lot more bloodshed in the union
a backlash against whites was something many expected from independence
and how can you combine african self government with real lasting safeguards for white minorities and asian minorities
i don't see why in independent africa a european an asian an arab or a member of any other minority community should not as an individual be accepted as a citizen of the country and that to me is really the greatest safeguard
but some of the white settlers particularly in kenya seem nervous about this
i know they're nervous i know they're nervous for two things one i think is one i have said where they think the demand for independence is equivalent to a desire to get rid of the white man from kenya which is not true the other one i may be forgiven to say this the other one i think is a guilty conscience that the african might retaliate
yes there was great fear among among white people working in africa colonial administrators and so on that there would be some terrible uprising afterwards and in most of africa it never happened on the contrary they were they were left alone and there were very few reports of of people being attacked or or robbed or anything like that but in congo that's where it went wrong
at first black and white were equal victims of indiscriminate looting rape and killing soon all hatreds turned on the belgian settlers in the cities their houses and possessions were destroyed in isolated posts in the villages and the missions spread throughout the congo there was murder
there was then a civil war and a large group of whites were taken hostage many of them were killed and i think that was the big shock but in fact it didn't happen i can't think of anywhere else in africa where it happened on any scale at all and what is the biggest problem for the new african states
i think there are going to be two main problems one is the usual one of establishing stable states and the other one of course is one of economic development
i'd like to ask you about that in territories which have so long been dependent on white skill and administration and capital are you sure that you can run your own affairs
most of the french colonies kept on a huge white french staff and that continued way well it continued in some ways to this day nyerere himself as he says i'm not about driving white people out of africa it's just that we have to rule africa not the while people and he was quite keen on having quite a lot of white british staff around him as well his secretary was a british woman
could western democracy work for these newly independent nations in africa
how can african independence such as you are going to achieve probably within the next ten years be prevented from becoming a dictatorship by the majority how could you make democracy really work in other words
democracy can only work when a people want to work it i can't say myself quite frankly that there is a formula there is some magic which once applied democracy is going to work democracy works is made to work by the people and let me say i have noticed nothing in africa which has reduced my faith that democracy will work in africa
there nyerere i think was wrong he says that the people will make it work but the people were excluded from democracy in africa from government i think what happened in africa essentially was two things one was the armies took over in a series of coup twenty one coups in that first decade the other is that i think best described by chinua achebe quite early on i think about nineteen sixty three he wrote it in his novel a man of the people and he says the colonialists have built this house and we were all out in the rain us africans were all out in the rain and suddenly the white man said he was leaving this house and we all ran towards it and he says the smart the lucky but not always the best rushed into it and slammed the doors and barricaded themselves in and then announced that all agitation should cease because otherwise the house would fall down and they've stayed in there and we've been out in the rain ever since
it's one thing for countries to become independent it's another thing to prove to use nyerere's phrase that democracy works in africa um i don't think that's proven yet so we can't yet say hand on heart that we know that democracy works in africa what i think we can what has been proved is that nothing else works and so therefore they have to move on they are moving on slowly towards er democracy that works it's the only it's the only way
nyerere became prime minister of the first government of independent tanganyika in nineteen sixty one and the following year he was voted president in the newly declared republic by nineteen sixty four tanganika was united with zanzibar and became known as tanzania
nyerere never let power go to his head he was always a very modest man he lived a very modest life he dressed very simply he spoke very simply and he is i think one of the heroes that emerge from that period although his grass roots socialist idea failed i think tanzania is one country where there is more equality or has been more equality than in other african countries and that there is a great sense of pride in tanzania which other some other african countries don't have i do attribute that to nyerere's vision and his own rather modest personality
from africa panorama turned its attention to india
i should think not it would be a very bad thing if it lasted already there are some signs of it getting less when it will entirely cease is difficult to say but i think progressively it'll get less and less
well the truth is that the cold war went on for another thirty years and that in the immediate aftermath of january nineteen sixty for the next three years or so it got worse and worse
he was a bit optimistic nehru because two years later we had the biggest single crisis of the cold war which was the cuba missile crisis
there was a move to create a non aligned movement which would stand between east and west not involved on either side in the cold war and india was one of the most important members of that group and nehru was a revered leader of india and of the developing and the non aligned world
what major concessions do you think that either say america or russia could make in the next ten years
major concessions have to be considered in the light of a particular problem for instance now they are dealing with european problems germany et cetera i don't know and i really can't say what concessions the real thing is if they could get rid of the fear that the other will attack them once they get rid of that fear the rest becomes relatively easy
but it wasn't going to be easy just months later in may the world was shown pictures of the wreckage of an american u. two spy plane shot down while flying over soviet airspace initially the u. s. claimed it had accidentally encroached on the territory but finally president eisenhower admitted it had been on a spying mission
no one wants another pearl harbour this means that we must have knowledge of military forces and preparations around the world especially of those capable of massive surprise attacks
then there was a series of ultimatums by khrushchev trying to get the west out of berlin it was only when we had stood up to that successfully that they looked for other means of preventing the haemorrhage of skilled people out of east berlin into the west across the unclosed border between the eastern and the western sectors
the berlin wall was a symbol of a kind of government which had to keep its own citizens in and could only do that by force
but at other parts of the border the west berliners can get right up close to the wall they stand and wave to distant figures on the other side to relatives or friends if they can pick them out or merely as one of them said to me to cheer the east berliners up and show that they are not forgotten
it was a brutal wall and people being shot trying to cross it it couldn't the truth there about the system was symbolised in a way which no one could really gainsay
and then er there was the cuba crisis
in october nineteen sixty two american spy planes photographed a build up of soviet missile bases on cuba just ninety miles off the u. s. coast over the next two weeks there was an increase of tension which many thought would trigger the world's first nuclear war
as the alert is stepped up missiles and rockets are slung under the wings of bombers and fighters to ready them if the go signal is given
the situation reached fever pitch
good evening my fellow citizens this government as promised has maintained the closest surveillance of the soviet military build up on the island of cuba within the past week unmistakeable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island the purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the western hemisphere
i was a student i watched the speech i think like all people all over the world i was nervous probably a little bit frightened i think that we all knew how important the stakes were it was clear that the u. s. government was not going to allow the continuation of those missiles in cuba
strategic air command b. fifty two bombers already on a massive worldwide airborne alert are now flying a twenty four hour mission the world awaits the outcome
i was actually in the american embassy the evening of the critical night and stayed on through the night helping with the translation of khrushchev messages to kennedy but it was quite clear to all of us in moscow that this crisis was the worst the most dangerous that there had been and that the possibility of a nuclear exchange really did exist in other words putting it personally that american nuclear weapons could have landed on the heads of westerners living in moscow
it was really considered an affront to us to have these missiles armed with nuclear warheads so close to our only ninety miles from the florida mainland so but it was a real threat and i think people were worried
at the end of er a long night following all that somewhere before dawn i went out with my wife into moscow to have a look round because we wanted to see whether the ordinary people on their way to work were behaving normally and in fact there were no bread queues none of the queues you would particularly have expected if people were worried and going to hoard things because they thought a great big crisis was coming
the most immediate challenge to us in the west must come from soviet russia now we have no direct broadcasts from russia tonight but not for want of trying but in the studio edward crankshaw who is the observer's expert on the soviet union is discussing with robert keye what the future holds for russia
oh i think if you're going to talk in terms of decades absolutely right not so much mao as such but the great problem of the sixties are going to be the chinese relations with the russians and with ourselves
well china and russia um sort of lived uneasily side by side they er were both communist countries er the russians wanted to help er er china but the chinese in a way broke away so it was an uneasy time there is an ideological rivalry khrushchev beginning to amend er marxism leninism after the death of stalin trying to put his own stamp on it reforming away from stalin's ways and china sticking more to the old rigid orthodoxy so there was that rivalry and then there was a rather unstable border the ussuri river was where shortly afterwards there was a burst of military incidents across the river and the sino soviet dispute which had been rumbling along more on an ideological level suddenly turned into an interstate crisis and um that was the coming out if you like of the sino soviet dispute which continued throughout the sixties and beyond they were rivals and from that moment overtly rivals
what about the economic battle people are saying that of course in ten years' time the russians will be pushing us out of world markets and that sort of thing are the chinese going to compete with the russians in that too or what
oh not in this decade i mean enough for ten years is enough and i don't think the chinese from what one hears are going to reach that stage
yes the russians are our challenge and they can be quite a stimulating challenge
the russian economy highly sort of regimented was actually in a poor way was not making the kind of progress which we in the west were making crankshaw doesn't seem quite to have grasped that but i do remember we were very much impressed by the sputnik by the and they were very good at putting this across in their propaganda so we got a rather and i think this shows in what crankshaw was saying we got rather exaggerated idea of how strong they were economically by the end of that decade i think they were slowing down a lot and the west was going ahead faster so the gap was growing not diminishing from about nineteen seventy onwards
economic rivalry between east and west wasn't the only concern at that time there was also the question of the newly independent countries in africa and asia the so called non committed or non aligned nations the question was which of the big powers east or west could attract their allegiance
they're not merely addressing themselves to us in competition they're trying to win some kind of moral leadership through economic aid over the
these sort of people those sort of people uncommitted nations
and the chinese i should say are going to be interested in them too and it'll be khrushchev's job to keep his end up as the senior communist when he really wants to relax a little and forget a little about communism and get on with economic stuff at home yeah
so it'll be here with the uncommitted nations that the real battle between china and russia takes place i think very largely
but now of course we're talking as if khrushchev's only and mao's only interests are going to be abroad with the africans and other asians the uncommitted nations but surely i mean even dictators have to think mainly of life at home don't they
but his real interests are at home in supplying this sort of stuff oh that kind of stuff i think he's got beyond now after all said and done the russians are getting as bored with that kind of photograph as we are and there's every sign that mr. khrushchev realises it
let's move on if we're feeling like this about him but you mean really that there's something more than just supplying trucks and television sets to the russians for khrushchev
it's a worry it's a complicated thing he's got to do at home
so that smile may wear off his face as the sixties go on
no it won't he's a professional politician of a highly gifted kind no politician's ever allowed the smile to wear off his face
khrushchev was ousted in nineteen sixty four so if he'd ever had a smile on his face it would have gone at that moment and he was a man who was impetuous and inconsistent rather brilliant but rather risky too and it's not surprising that he was ousted by a series of dull people around him and so the soviet union settled down in the mid sixties to being a steadier performer in the world um smile was khrushchev steadiness and perhaps even dignity was brezhnev and for the world's peace the latter was safer
for a view of the problems that europe will be facing in the next ten years we go now to france to the economist and philosopher bertrand de jouvenal
jouvenal said something rather ironical because there was somebody who tried to say that he was going to be responsible for his country's defence and that was none other than general de gaulle who left the nato defence arrangements shortly after those remarks by de jouvenal de gaulle knew extremely well that america could not allow western europe to fall under soviet influence and that nato would continue to exist and continue to deter soviet aggression for that reason and therefore that french security would be looked after anyway without france being in the in the military arrangements of nato it was a cynical if you like ploy but totally successful he was completely right in his analysis
in december nineteen sixty two president kennedy met prime minister macmillan in the bahamas britain was buying america's newest weapons system
i feel sure that the agreement into which we have entered is a good one for both of us for in obtaining an agreement for the united kingdom to acquire what is called the polaris missile
the acquisition of polaris was soon overshadowed de gaulle felt britain was too close to the u. s. and blocked britain's entry into the common market
so de gaulle vetoed it that of course postponed the whole process by ten years which didn't suit anybody very well but that was the stage we were at we were on the move but hadn't yet arrived as a full member of what's now the european union
i think de gaulle's motives in dealing with the question of britain's membership in the european community were very french national motives i think he felt that britain could become a leader in the european community to rival france and so he found the arguments he could find in order to say no to us the american relationship was indeed the one he cited most so what he said was true on the american point but i think his real reasons were not that at all
and so to the youngest continent to north america it's one of the greatest continents and yet one that's least sure of its destiny patrick o'donovan reports from washington
yankee doodle
the american eagle the symbol of a revolutionary democracy whose first success against the british nearly two hundred years ago changed the course of history and today dominates a very large part of the world yet under its wings all is not well here in america people are well aware that the next ten years contain an unprecedented challenge to their power to their comfort and perhaps even to their lives and no other nation has ever been warned so precisely and so often yet life is very good here and most people seem to feel that the next ten years will be simply a continuation of today but some americans especially the articulate ones do not take the prospect quite so calmly one of these is adlai stevenson he's concerned with the lack of initiative abroad and the conformity at home he rejects many of the things that america takes for granted mr. stevenson was twice defeated for the presidency and is still standing in the wings as a democratic possible for a third try panorama found him in new york on the eighteenth floor of his fifth avenue hotel
i'm very anxious about what happens to the individual in mass society the growth of technology has contributed to our physical ease to our mobility and so on but i wonder if it's contributed to the discrimination of our minds certainly we have been obsessed in this country with with security physical security economic security social security and so on the price of security is often group thinking conformity and all the dangers to individuality to the diversity to the eccentricity of individuals which make a country exciting interesting and lively and dynamic
this propaganda film shows the depth of paranoia felt by some sections of american society fearful of a communist takeover
the mccarthy ethos was hostile to the emancipation of women and hostile to homosexuality so this wider conformity spread pervasively through american society
now i think given freedom given responsibility that we'll discover that we're hungry for it but the important thing is freedom even more important perhaps than the individual's national freedom and the survival of the ideas that are precious to us
i think that the rebellion came from people like himself who were critical of the mccarthy ethos and then it spread outwards blowing in the wind by bob dylan
by the nineteen sixties the civil rights movement was gaining momentum doctor martin luther king a baptist minister was leading the campaign with marches and non violent protest
by around about sixty four sixty five people were beginning to say there is another america that actually there are a lot of poor people in america and that came partly out of the civil rights movement because a lot of um black people who got involved were pointing out that it wasn't only voting rights but their economic position um at the bottom of the pile
the civil rights movement was becoming increasingly radicalised king found that many younger people were becoming impatient with his strategy of non violent action and by nineteen sixty three he too felt that progress was stagnating
we can't win the struggle here in america without in some way bringing white america around to the point of being just and seeing the negro as a human being and treating him that way the riot is the language of the unheard and america has failed to hear that the plight of the negro poor has worsened america has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquillity and the status quo than about humanity justice and equality
it took a while but it was the beginning of the end of segregation the sit ins at the lunch counters i think people were just astounded people who really weren't aware of how difficult a situation it was in the south i think that was brought home to all americans
by nineteen sixty eight it was brought home to the world pro civil rights and anti vietnam war demonstrations were held nationwide but both martin luther king and robert kennedy were assassinated
sympathy for the devil by the rolling stones
only a few years ago the man who was head of the manhattan project the anglo american programme which during the war produced the atom bomb was pilloried before congress for his doubts but doctor robert oppenheimer no longer makes bombs and he is now their opponent he's found his academic haven he's head of a marvellous and richly endowed institution called the institute for advance studies in princeton new jersey he's left alone at his institute to work and think and write and to help other people do the same and no more is asked of him
i hope that these ten years will see a growing effort to transform the world and the relations between states and their functions to exorcise the unprecedented dangers of modern warfare
the question and issue is shall the human race survive or shall it not
first you duck and then you cover and very tightly you cover the back of your neck and your face duck and cover underneath a table or desk or anything else close by
duck and cover
and of course we all remember president kennedy when he came in to office about building a bunker in your back yard
i went on the aldermaston march in nineteen sixty two we were brought up with this fear of annihilation it was very genuine people thought we were going to you know be annihilated and so there was a feeling that we were you know at the edge of disaster there was a pop song called eve of destruction ban the bomb eve of destruction
riders of the storm by the doors
over three million vietnamese were killed the war would continue for another five years
of course the nineteen sixties are going to be a decade of science but the question which interests me is what kind of science you see the fallacy of the fifties has been to think that the only kind of science which matters and which is forging ahead is physical science atomic physics fusion launching projectiles into space control mechanisms electronics now i think this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the important way in which the real basis of science is shifting i believe that the great work of the nineteen sixties will be not in physics at all but in biology i think it's in exploring the fundamental nature of life and of living processes that the great progress of the next ten years will come we are on the threshold of a biological revolution and to tell you the truth the biological evolution has already begun
in some senses bronowski was right there was a biological revolution and the irony is if you ask biology students today what they're studying they're not cutting up dogfish they're not looking at birds they're basically doing chemistry biochemistry looking at cells the entire science had completely changed so in that sense he was right it's very hard to deny that i think like most sciences biology changed for technical reasons that the technology of looking at things got much much better
we shall learn much more about the way that the cell works perhaps we shall learn what really makes a cell go wrong and then we shall at last have the basic secret of cancer we shall certainly learn a great deal more about the action of drugs on cells particularly the cells of the nerves and of the brain
i think bronowski's statement about cancer is crucial to understanding the optimism of the sixties and the mitigated pessimism of the modern day certainly he was dead right in saying that we now understand the basics of cancer maybe soon and i'm sure bronowski would speak with equal enthusiasm today in the beginning of the new millennium maybe soon this enormous mass of theoretical understanding we have with the cell will turn itself into a practical result of curing cancer i'm sure bronowski would have predicted forty years ago that it would have done it by now but it hasn't but it might tomorrow the day after nobody knows
ten nine ignition sequence starts
the final part of the panorama programme looked at the challenges of space exploration at the beginning of the decade the russians were dominating the space race here is how the programme and their expert saw the situation in january nineteen sixty
for most of us the symbol of progress in the sixties must remain the race to the moon and who will win perhaps by nineteen seventy the first spaceship will have landed on the moon we shall know whether these men are russian or american they can hardly be british but even if there's no british moon rocket by nineteen seventy we shall have a grandstand view through the aerials of our huge radio telescope at jodrell bank here's the director professor lovell
last year the telescope at jodrell bank was involved in some exciting research programmes these covered the exploration of the remote parts of the universe and the tracking of the american and russian space probes personally i think that russia now has the capability both of sending a man into space at least for a few orbits and also of making a soft landing of instruments on the moon i think that within a few years also we shall see instrumented probes getting close to the nearer planets such as mars and venus
when the space programme started the russians had the lead they were more single minded about it they had the first satellite first man in space first space probe to the planets they had all that and it worked america had to catch up
the americans were still suffering from the directives of eisenhower that um no use should be made of military technology whereas the russians used their ballistic missile to launch the sputnik and these other satellites the americans had been completely surprised by the capability of the soviets um you know one one member of congress said anyone could throw a hunk of old iron into space that was the sort of attitude they refused to believe for a long time that the soviets had this capability alas this was not the case
and just one year later it was russian cosmonaut yuri gagarin who successfully completed the first manned orbit around the globe it was headline news around the world these soviet successes made americans realise they were in second place in the space race
what do you think about america not being able to do the same well if i was in military service and fell down on the job like that i could stand for court martial somebody's falling down on the job badly
just one month later america followed it was to be the first of many missions
then of course the great question which arises is whether within this decade we shall see the actual landing of a man on the moon it's very difficult to judge whether this will in fact take place but it's useful to remember that the president of the russian academy nesmeyanov has stated that the project of landing a man on the moon is in the next seven year plan for soviet science all that i can say about that is that a short time ago i wrote an article for a literary gazette in moscow and made reference to nesmeyanov's statement well the article was published as i wrote it apart from the fact that the timescale of the man on the moon project was crossed out so i think at the present time it must be regarded as somewhat doubtful whether the man will be landed on the moon within this decade
well even bernard lovell can't be right every time and we've every reason to think that that might not be so
we were still uncertain about who would get the man on the moon at that time it soon occurred to me that the russians seemed more anxious than the americans to make certain that they would get their man back to earth safely
in response to the russian success in space president kennedy addressed america
i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
in nineteen sixty there was only one telescope in the world that could track space rockets and missiles jodrell bank in cheshire sir bernard lovell soon found he was being asked to use it for more than just astronomy
we hadn't built the telescope to help the russians and the americans we were in the middle of that sandwich sounds interesting in retrospect but i can tell you it was pretty anxious times then this lasted until the cold war was over i mean this led us to a truly remarkable situation where as the cuban crisis developed between the soviets and the west we still had the only instrument in the world that could detect the launching of the soviet missiles i had agreed in the event of a military emergency we would use the telescope to detect the launch of soviet ballistic missiles which were targeted on london
at the start of the decade russia may have led the space race but on july twenty first nineteen sixty nine the world was asking would the americans finish it by getting the first man on the moon by the end of the decade
contact the eagle has landed it's one small step for man one giant leap for mankind
during the actual apollo landings i was wearing two hats i was over at nasa came back to do the commentaries i always remember at the time when i saw neil and buzz going down onto the moon surface frankly i was worried remember this hadn't been done before had they made a faulty landing come down at an angle something gone wrong they couldn't have gone back
columbia columbia this is houston over
the americans did take a considerable risk nearly every piece of equipment was duplicated in the american moon programs except one and that was the rocket which would lift off armstrong and aldrin to the mother ships circling around the moon if that had failed i'm afraid that armstrong and aldrin would not have survived
prepare for take off that was beautiful twenty six thirty six feet a second up very smooth
what i think is not known at that time when armstrong and aldrin were on the moon the russians had a satellite in orbit around the moon now unfortunately from the point of the view of the russians something went wrong at the moment of landing if they had succeeded they would have got moon rocks back to earth before the americans you can say that the decade was spanned by two events in space the first one is gagarin the first man in space achieved by the soviet union to world acclaim and the second is the moon landing achieved by the united states at the end of the decade to world acclaim what's the difference the difference is that when gagarin and the sputnik story came out of the soviet union the united states saw a possible technological advance ahead of them by the soviet union and got its act together in a very big way and they got to the moon and the soviet union never got to the moon the nineteen sixties were a bit of a turning point in that regard
but it's too late for most as the scale of the tragedy hits home there is talk of fifty thousand dead across the region
they still believe there are children underneath this rubble that is where the relief effort will continue until every parent finds out what has happened to their child we will have two powerful reports from the heart of the devastated area
massive relief operation and they keep on adding more and more soldiers to those already on the ground but still there are some areas in this mountainous remote province that have not been reached they have been cut off for days by landslides the chinese government is faced with a number of key priorities it has got to get through to those areas it has to help the survivors that need that hold the most and it has to get much more aid in this is now turning into the biggest challenge the chinese government has faced for many years
any problems l. walked down from the ground after the game surrounded by disappointed rangers fans and they were still in good humour and still really enjoying the atmosphere so i don't think you can put alcohol down to this these were hooligans behaving in an unacceptable way
today was a time of recovery and reflection these bars and cafes opened their doors once again
it was hard to get the people out of here obviously our restaurant turned into a public toilet and everything was trashed in here there was not much we could do
we have very good door staff a pleasant atmosphere everyone is helpful and friendly last night you were walking into a war zone last night
everything is going
continue to take place and we have to get ahead of the game with the responsibility of two thousand twelve coming to us we we need to make sure we have
there must have been others who were complicit in this exercise if they are still in the system i would argue that he has an obligation to help us get them out of the system
and beat it now he is in
position to help stop others from doing the same channel four has won significant sum in damages from the crown prosecution service and from west midlands police they had claimed that documentary exposing islamic extremism was misleading and distorted the dispatches programme undercover mosque was also cleared by ofcom of any wrong doing gordon brown has been trying to reassure voters that he has the right man to guide britain through the economic difficulties ahead he blamed international factors along with rising oil and food prices for the problems he has had in recent weeks
i have taken the british economy through difficult times in the past the background to everything that is happening at the moment is people's frustration about rising food bills rising costs at the supermarket rising petrol prices that is happening around the world we have to steer the economy through this l. have done it before and can do it again
in the past we haven't seen girls significantly being involved in crime however recently we have stealing things like cosmetics make up it seems a terrible waste for young people to enter the criminal justice system get a criminal record for stealing things like that
what we might once have called miss chief today we label as crime a catfight between school girls saw leanne convicted of common assault two years ago aged fifteen in another era she might have got detention these
if you bring children into a form formalised youth justice system it is harder to get them out of the system if we don't want to see girls feeding through later on it is best to divert them an at early stage especially for offence which aren't serious in nature which could be dealt in other ways
was surprised i had a message from barack obama on my answering machine this is what he said there
this is barack obama calling to apologise on two fronts one was you didn't get your question answered second apology for using the word sweetie it is a bad habit of mine
nantwich by election where david cameron and the conservatives are hoping to record the first conservative gain in al by election for more than twenty five years
i will put this in my pocket
but it has become clear if we could see his notes we are witnessing a three day fight backstrategy on day one he spoke about the ten pence tax rate getting rid of one of the biggest problems day two he unveiled a draft queen's speech a programme of legislation for next year and today summiting himself to a media grilling
report what is your message to the labour
what is the message to the labour m. p.'s plotting to bring you down
we are going through a difficult economic situation but the first concern is the cost of household goods what is in the shopping basket what they have to pay in the petrol station these are the events duce to world circumstances you need a government able to deal with the problems and address them
fighting back in the face of the bad headlines is difficult but not impossible others have managed it
from a very difficult position and win the nineteen ninety two election david hill replaced alastair campbell at number ten but in ninety two was head of press for the defeated labour party he say there is are lessons for gordon brown
gordon brown has attempted to reduce the number of damaging headlines the press team are now apparently trying to make sure he is not photographed in any embarrassing situation but even the most diligent media handler cannot prevent the odd bum photo but the prime minister is beginning to smile more than as he did as the chancellor some believe it is nowhere near enough to eliminate the negatives
you must be heard talking big things to give the government new momentum you are asking to be re elected for a fourth term the press conference i could not think of anything of substance coming out to give a sense of direction momentum i was taking notes therefore out there there will be no sense of what this is about what he is about
i think that he knows where he wants to go and why but is not yet fulling yorked out how to express it l. don't think he is properly alighted on the key policies that he must pursue in order to ensure that people recognise that he has a sense of direction and got conviction
one of gordon brown's problems is that some of his m. p.'s think that others in the party could do a much better job as the leader that is something that john major had to face in nineteen ninety five when john major was facing difficulties outside of his government and divisions inside he told the critics it was time to put up or shout up and resubmitted himself to a leadership contest was he wrong to do that
prime ministerships ends some after a long time some after only a brief stay there are problems on the horizon for gordon brown the by election and proposals to extend pre charge detention for terror suspects for a start if that goes badly if the fight back does not seem to work gordon brown may be heading for the exit quicker the focus on the intense burst of activity to get back on the front foot is the crewe and nantwich by election not long ago labour would have been able to hold the seat we sent michael there to make a nuisance of himself springtime in nantwich by elections are rare these days this is the most important since labour came to power a contest which may show whether labour's days are now numbered and the tories are back in business it is so keenly fought that what the labour candidates spoke to the press today one party official tried to block even the name of their tory challenger
gwyneth dunwoody although when the slimmer version sat in the welsh she preferred the double barreled name for some reason labour hopes that the shorter name will do the trick
are you gwyneth's daughter yes
nice to meet you used to chat with her
that is not how it happened elisabeth was the choice for the party and the local party too wishes to have her stand
but you and your henchmen would not even decide to choose mr. god win even though he had been chosen as a party candidate
elizabeth has been chosen as the candidate
i have a lot of independent minded m. p.'s in my party
are you happy for him to rebel
obviously i lead my party i like my members to support me but they have to put their conscious third the constituency second and the party third that is the way that i behave that is the way that others behave you can see my team coming together but in the end the member of the parliament u. must do what is right for his or her constituents
where are you going to rebel
grammar school
back in nantwich the former health secretary himself a soft confessed class warrior frank dobson defended labour's jibes against timpson this is the way to campaign mocking the conservative candidate as a tory boy with picture of what is described as his mansion house
well it is a mansion
upping ham actually
he is a to have he has lots of money we are drawing it to the attention of the people of crewe and quite rightly
talking to the voters it is clear that the ten pence tax row is still hurting despite the concessions many are still leaving labour
everything that they touch goes wrong the labour government
what about the conseing sessions made by the chancellor concessions made by the chancellor
it is not enough it is not helping the poorest people
i am voting conservative for the first time in
always been a socialist
always voted labour i am changing my mind now
i think what he did he is a perfectly good communicator
take us into the big question which is whether there is something pro found something that could happen in the dying days of the last conservative government
it was a long slow process
it was slow but irtel avivable there comes a point whatever you do you cannot get it back
there is a big difference this is why i think it is important we by this stage of tony blair's leadership had don a lot of had don a lot more than david cameron has done it is as if labour has been the only show in town for so long there is little pressure put upon the conservatives to spell out real policies programmes it is up to the labour party to start putting the pressure on get it back to being a real sense of a debate between competing leaders parties philosophies and policies that is what i feel is missing
i few
there was not that much of a comparison we like our prime ministers respect them and trust them with gordon brown you cannot say any of those things to lose all three qualities is amazing in
being the prime minister and not being liked very much like margaret thatcher but there is something about gordon brown that just seems to almost scare people
big strategic decisions you take and about forcing the debate so it becomes a contest when they say they are comparing to cameron they don't know that much about david cameron he flits around like a butter fly he looks pretty
and the general election is to get the debate focused better than it is now so that people start to see it is not a referendum on gordon brown but a choice between gordon brown and david cameron as the prime minister you look at the figures that is where they are they can be changed
he's got two years before he has to have general ection look at the way he has gone from last summer until now what he has to find a way of doing is replicating the reasons people liked him in his early period when they thought he was competent decisive and appeared to be in charge when he responded to the terror attacks l. think it would be fatal if what was supposed to be the core of the gordon brown offer that i am this reliable competent i may not be flashy but you can rely on me if he loses that the brand is bust
it is not helping that cherie blair is producing unflattering memoirs
well there you go do not think
they will be more like our books
of less than a year he has gone from hero to sub zero and maybe he can reverse that
i would not be
can reverse that surprised if gordon brown has some
weeks that better than others and it might look like things are looking better for gordon brown
certainly over the last few have been attending our international conferences a lot more getting a lot more knowledge they are exnert their own right they face the same problems we do in the u. k. with a stock of dams that pose a wide range of ages and types of dams it will be necessary to look at all of them in the area affected by this earthquake they will have to go around and have a look at them and make sure that they have haven't been damned in
inspecting does it tell you much about the damage inside to the rock filling of the dam
it will give a lot of indication but of course the rock interior has some flexibility associated with it that perhaps the concrete itself doesn't just because there is cracking and spauling along here on the joint between the plates doesn't necessarily mean there is damage inside the dam because there is movement between the bits of fill
they have very leased the water from behind the dam and say it's safe that doesn't mean it's safe to let the water build up again there are questions about the safety of nuclear facilities in the region few hard facts officials say there is are no civilian reacts within one thousand kilometers of the earthquake zone that is not quite the whole story china's nuclear power institute is located in chengdu the capital city of sichuan it include as newspaper of research reactors there are two cities within the earthquake zone gang yang and manage yang home to key parts of china's nuclear weapons design programme people are beginning to ask if politics and construction companies have cut corners as images of the day that shook this once secretive country stream out tell of the combined effect of nature's forces and man's folly a trail of human suffering there is stark contrast between how the authorities in china and burma have responded to the internal disasters that have struck both countries is it possible they are using the shock and chaos of these recipures to exploit further their own people that is the argument put forward by naomi klein journalist and author of the shock doctrine she joins frus toronto what do you think may be going on as consequence of these natural disasters naomi klein
well what we see in after these huge natural disasters is the status quo but much more so in both china and burma you have regimes that are fairly characterised as crony capitalist regimes regimes where the government tends to give lucrative contracts to politically connected firms this is happening in burma in the wake of the disaster in fact the disaster is ongoing we news actually that politically connected firm called the tour trading company that built the new capital in burma has gotten contracts to rebuild schools which is shocking they haven't come up with emergency shelters or water or food fort people but they are handing out these contracts this is kind of what you would like this is burma's hallaburton they are getting the contracts the burmese regime is using the chaos to push through their referendum which is a. r. unpopular referendum that locks in their power even after elections in burma
that was going to happen any way the referendum was going
the people who say that sometimes natural disasters may per sip tate political change the example that is cited is east and west pakistan they are just being undo youly optimistic in ourjudgement
i know i don't think so disasters are politically volatile moments they can go either way the burmese regime one of the reasons why they have been so staunch in their refusal to allow foreigners into the country is because they are afraid of resistance spreading in the country they are also afraid of a mutiny within their own ranks within the military that is part of the reason the theory is that they are actually not distributing the aid to the people but distributing it to their own people to hair their soldiers so they won't face a mutiny anything can happen in a disaster another famous case mex kos nineteen eighty five this is a case worth remembering when there was a terrible earthquake in mexico city but it didn't affect the whole city equally the public housing collapsed in mexico city right next to buildings that were privately owned or government buildings that stood what the earthquake showed was that in the construction of the public housing frbl the housing for poor people corners were cut something people suspected any way it brought out these issues around corruption bribe taking and lack of respect for people's lives that gave birth to pewerful pro democracy movement in mexico these are volatile moments disasters can be used by the existing powers they can be used by counter powers stkphrfplt thank you very much for joining us
coming up on the programme what should we make of the mining company our government is teeming up with in the congo should they really receive u. k. government backing other news police in manchester have released c. c. t. v. images showing up to two hundred football fans chasing officers and attacking one of them after the ueyaef cup final last night footage shows rangers supporters tipping up the greater manchester tripping up the greater manchester police officers and jumping on him after the match eleven porers support verse been charged barack obama has apologised to reporter for calling her sweetie
seen all the change that has happened in the village water to drink farming activities this beautiful school that is what we are singing about all this change has been brought about with the help of packt congo and anvil mining
you should not be connected you should not have allegations of very serious human rights violations attached to your name until your name is cleared then are you not in the front running to be a member of this scheme
for enthusist ast it is a a ground breaking allowance it encourages firm to spend money on clinics and schools that serve their workforce but on wider development goals this gravel making venture provides extra employment outside the mines in a
government everything which they touch will is always a good answer
i have a lot of respect for anvil mining l. was working for that company those type of investor we want to come to add value to our land
no vehicles because they have got no vehicles anvil mining sent theirs to pweto to collect the soldiers when the soldiers got to where the fighting was then it was anvil mining who fed the soldiers put them up all the food lodging transport they needed for the time
cruisers the officers were driving where from anvil mining as well
another survivor the local police chief says he and others were locked in a make shift prison by the troops and beaten repeatedly by them the soldiers then counted them and took some away under the eyes of two anvil staff
trance they saw the prisoners with me being taken away in the vehicles every time they came the prisonsoners would be counted one two three four five then they were made to get into the anvil mining vehicles they were then driven off to unknown destinations it was only afterwards that i learnt that all those prisoners were killed
provided that transportation to get their soldiers down to kilwa we helped the military get to with a then we were gone whatever they did there that's an internal issue it's got nothing to do with anvil it's an internal government issue how they handle that is up to them no involvement of us absolutely
but he did admit planes chartered by anvil were later used to transport prisoners back now the company says the trucks were common deerped it produced letter from the governor confirming that it's dated june two thousand five eight months after the events adele knows she wants the case forgotten she can't forget she is forced to share a house with her surviving children too traumatised and intimidated to return to their old gnome kilwa is britain putting its new alliance with anvil and the local governor ahead of justice in the congo
we were approached last october by a diplomat from the british embassy here he discussed the issue of the victims with us we proofered our solutions the diplomat said he would arrange another meeting with us we are still waiting the call hasn't come we were hoping the british government would use its position to make the company's pay damages to the victims of the atrocities
british campaigners believe the u. k. government is letting the people of congo down in a wider sense by failing to encourage greater transparency in the mining industry
that on the other hand it is one of our core values that we should
i think it's good if an industrialself wants to improve its relationships with local communities and to run projects but why should it have the backing particularly of the british government it's not even a british company we think it's sending out a signal it doesn't matter what you do and we will help you improve your image abroad afterwards
britain's growing keener and keener on business led development impressed undoubtedly by the example of china chiep chinese firms are building billions of dollars of infrastructure in congo in return for minerals newsnight discovered that britain's ambassador has been negotiating for months for the u. k. to come in on that deal it will spend several million to ensure the chinese roads meet environmental standards does the u. k. also worry that western firms might lose out in the new scrabble for africa

why do you want this done donna
because gaz is prettier than me i just think bigger lips would help with that
are you sure surgery is the answer
well is prozac the answer
to be honest yes usually
because after my mum died our g. p. was really keen for us to go on that when i wouldn't have prozac he offered diazepam when i wouldn't have diazepam he offered lithium and when i wouldn't he offered a new puppy i just think he ran out of ideas
you need to work through this before you even consider altering your face have you tried exercising and looking at your diet my diet
i'm the same weight i've always been i can eat what i want and drink what i want i am one of those hateful bitches apparently that was what dear old mum used to say you could be depressed

i suppose and when he gets in his first fight
someone needs to square up to the other one's dad and to be honest i'm a damn sight squarer
just because i'm scared doesn't mean he needs someone to comfort him when he has his scary first wank

hiya oh what's up with you i was already feeling insecure about this pregnancy thing and gaz has made me think he'll be a better dad i can't believe him
he's so out of order thinking he can just run your lives and pass comment because he's so attractive he's unbelievable i hate him i can't believe he's done that
um actually all he really did was bring a monkey a monkey
a monkey bastard i hate him not as much as the monkey hates that duck right i'm going to go round there and give him hell i'm going to smack him in his stupidly gorgeous face and then spit on his wretchedly sexy thighs and then kick him in his fine fine booty i'm doing this for you jonny otherwise i'd never want to see his horribly beautiful eyes ever again
she's completely over him isn't she

in the jungle the quiet jungle the lion sleep tonight a eeeeee um bum b. a. whey all right donna i've not seen you in ages you look almost as good as me
i can't believe you're worming your way into jonny's role to usurp him as far as father of this baby
what's that got to do with you i think you've just come down here for a sneaky peak at this fine booty
no gaz even if your booty is indeed fine as you proclaim i'm getting you out of my system as we speak if i do what the doctor tells me to do i'm going to look so good that your booty is going to be kissing my booty's booty

yes and i'm going to be here to deliver the state of play at westminster during this last crazy week

the great leader has become
the great leader after saying he was barking mad when i said barking mad i didn't mean barking
it was a nice thing to do
she's in generous mood tonight michael what was your moment
it appeared in the papers there's an idea around for a b. b. c. show in which young hopefuls will be judged on whether they would make good prime ministers and the idea has been put up to the prime minister that he should be the judge of this show that he should become a celebrity
minister the prospect that he could be more popular than sir alan sugar apparently it's being considered
you were at prime minister's questions yesterday you were sitting on the floor of the house not in the gallery that's how privileged you are that in a way is our theatre of politics what due make of it
it's like old fashioned musical with all the barracking and everything l. have faced many hostile audiences
especially in glasgow
oh yes
americans don't have that
she's nervous now i've heard you talk about how many show business has changed in your lifetime particularly with the influence of television from the vaudeville to what we now have has politics changed enough for the modern world
i think it has and it is i think now the younger people like in america this time that was so remarkable i'd never seen a primary in america
it has engaged
dianne how much are gordon brown's problems done to just the way he comes over on modern media
that is an issue i think it's a marginal issue the state of the world economy is more fundamental to gordon's problems
obviously there are policy issues but modern politics is also about personality i think i get the sense lot of people don't feel the prime minister's personality either comes over or what they see of his personality they don't like
round in a circle now this is a political discussion show i'm move to michael portillo go for the serious one in the group don't encourage her in a sense gordon brown doesn't get or doesn't come across well on the modern media
five or six delegates going for the nomination for the democratic party
he was my mum's favourite
i've forgotten the favourite question
you get these five candidates and it's almost like the weakest link without a. n. n. robinson and they fire these questions that's good you see people's personality come through how did they deal with that question this is why when a president is elected in america
now she's correcting you they're a tough crowd in this place
the democrats will choose the most charismatic candidate and the republicans will choose the least
she's attacked you twice in the london and bruce mentioned the london mayoral elections these were kind of presidential weren't they and they got big turnout by london standards
yes it was almost in some parts like a general election turnout which is very good i have to say i wouldn't get carried away with the personality aspect of it linton cross by the australian one of the things he did that wasn't glamorous he got tory voters out four times the turnout organised as karl rove did for president bush too do you
the prepbl can never see any reason why he should agree or she should agree the prime minister thinks that he or she holds most of the wards and simply gives credibility to the other candidate if the prime minister engages the other
disputatious house of commons the best of our politicians do know how to debate at least as good as the americans
tore them apart
because he's a
you're young man so what about your political ambitions
none at the moment
that's a very political answer you know
i've been practising i knew that was coming
we'll take that as a maybe thank you very much for coming on
i'm a fan of the show l. watch it every week in fact i'm sky plusing it at the moment there's a pause lovely toll see you
this is where i started to play tennis with tony blair many years ago they were great days this those days the sun was sunshine down on the labour party sadly things aren't going too well for labour today i'm certainly a labour man through and through and always will be but look at what's happened things are getting really tough and i certainly learnt in those days you've got to keep the ball in play and you've got to win all the points we've got the crewe by election coming up next week suddenly two point seven billion has come out the budget in order to cope with those who've suffered because the ten p. tax rate has been abolished you know what l. don't even think roger federer could have put a better spin on it than that
this is one off change only for
this year only he serves up
compensation con after a tax con and expects people to believe it what utter cynicism what total incompetence and what complete humiliation for this chancellor of the exchequer
this is the party that when the proposal was first made they were in favour of withdrawing the ten p. rate last year when my right honourable friend put forward his amendment they abstained thee weeks ago they wanted to reinstate the ten p. rate their position has been completely confused and it's self evident today they've no idea whether they're for or against what we're proposing
over the weekend i allowed my campaign to become personal l. much regret that and i apologise without reservation
an education bill to ensure every school is a good school an n. h. s. bill to ensure the health service to entrench patients' rights an immigration bill so people earn their citizenship a welfare reform bill reforms on agency workers on scales and on flexible working these are the priorities and i commend this statement to the house
there are lots and lots of things in this statement that we welcome not least because we propose them we welcome the constitution for the n. h. s. that's an idea we set out last june we welcome the extension of the right to flexible working we announced that in september two thousand six i hope when he gets up we'll get a bit of gratitude from the prime minister for all of it he can't really say we haven't got any substance when he's taken it all and put it in his queen's speech
facing on gordon and the government there's a world economic crisis and mervyn king has just said that and that really is affecting this country like many others very badly
the nice decade is behind us the credit cycle has turned commodity prices are rising we are travelling along a bumpy road as the economy rebalances policy monetary cannot and should not try to prevent that ajudgment the monetary policy committee must focus on bringing inflation back to the two per cent target in the medium term
week in crewe then gordon it's going to get tougher for u. and i hear that david cameron who's got a
welcome to this week
thank you
diane when you heard the chancellor make his announcement on the ten p. tax band and and it was going to cost almost three billion to put it right was it going did you fall off your chair
it's our humber bridge actually he the labour m. p.'s just wanted people that
budget a few weeks ago
a lot of labour m. p.'s are wegt themselves that's what changed
sometimes you give me too much information michael where is this on the richter scale of u. turns which
yes and i think it's geometic
then this is a kind of seventy eight it's a big one it's pretty
big i don't remember a u. turn on
budget quite as big remember having to change things like petrol tax but to change the income tax provisions at cost of twenty seven billion within six or seven weeks of the of the budget it's pretty unprecedented really
michael the scale of the u. turn and the amount of money that we weren't meant to have that's being spent or borrowed of course didn't that make us realise what a mess he was in the prime minister he was looking at the end if he had lost his finance bill it could have been curtains for him
i still don't understand how it happened in the first place how can you really go against your core voters the populous that votes and supports you these are your labour supporters how can you take away the ten p. tax rate from them it was so dramatically wrong thating dramatic had to be done to put it right
it's called losing touch the moment that the chancellor of the exchequer as he then was announced the abbiggs of the ten p. abolition of the ten p. rate was when he announced the reduction of income tax of two p. it dished of the torbgs apparently for those fifteen being be seconds of glory he did something which is really damaging to his own supporters
they did exactly because they were desperate it's the middle england thing which your friend tony blair was so keen on
which is he thought he had autumn pencilled in for an he was terrified the tories would go in with the twenty p. basic rate he just thought he would get away with it
some of his advisers said this is not the right thing to do
happens to the election to say it wasn't debated frank field moved an management
significant when you said how damaged is he her answer is he can survive
of course he can
that there will be a leadership push it takes seventy signatures there are not seventy signatures to remove gordon brown
who is the push going to go to
we want to get rid of gordon brown because he's wooden on camera who do we replace him with david miliband
why would you want to be a new leader at the moment
you'd be surprised at the people who think they are that person
i don't have to say anything really
no doubt you will
he will survive because a lot of this is hysteria a lot of labour m. p.'s weren't even members of the party when blair became leader who are not used to unpopularity
the moment
he's on a roll
is on a roll is he still really the right person to lead this country i'm not convinced of that
you're a labour supporter
i am a labour supporter you're right what i'm shock b. d. is in spite of the whole blair brown fiasco over the last number of years i truly thought gordon was solid and had an understanding of his party and politics
and his
raised mlds of pounds for the labour party
don't underestimate
it wouldn't be good
is he going to lose crewe
we think our vote is holding up gordon isn't helped you know by former blair courteers bad mouthing him
are you talking about michael levy
no no but he's not helped by the bad mouthing that gez on behind the scenes
let me come onto this bank of england inflation report that has come out is a devastating economic document which will be the back drop for our politics over the next year or so it's talking about inflation reaching almost four per cent on the narrow measure by the end of this year and staying there unemployment rising of growth slowing way down maybe even couple of quarters of negative growth for a man prime minister who made his name on the economy
the prime minister who made his name on the economy as chancellor is still saying judge me by the economy if i was mr. brown and read that report i might think twice
good to be here
we like to think we're a dignified bunch here the other day dianne turned down another offer to spill the beans in her tell all memoirs of her nights in balmoral with prince sorry i promised not to say we don't wash our dirty laundry in public l. know for a fact michael sends out his to a posh outfit in knightsbridge dignity is our middle name not everyone is so demure in a week when cherie blair told us she was quote too embarrassed to pack her contraceptive equipment when she went to balmoral too much information cherie no more thank you we found ourselves wondering how low can you go not much lower some of you say tonight we decided to put dignity in the spotlight what price dignity in two thousand eight as the former p. m.'s wife lost her by publishing her memoirs
when i get older losing my hair machine many years from now
whatever happened to maintaining a dignified silence does dignity have any currency now adays or is it what's selling out worth selling out for the cash when you can cherie's not alone john prescott has been going public about his private life some politicians will do anything to look human but is it dignified
who's the best kisser
onto i've been on both sides i've had lack of dignity and hopefully managed to reclaim it l. think it's important because it suggests honesty acceptance and also taking accountability for the things that you get wrong in life and saying hands up which is what frank field
it is a very rare and brave thing for somebody to stand up there and do what he did l. think probably it is rarer than it should be rarer sometimes in politics and in life now adays people are less dignified because we're chasing after the deal aren't we everybody's chasing
is it more difficult then in your view to be dignified today than it might have been in years gone by
i think we're becoming a very selfish society and yes i think we're not taught dignity so well now adays
do you think that's right did we have more dignity in days gone by than we do today are we live
depends on the person
it's the way we were broad up it's the way we should be brought up
where are the examples today when cherie blair writes what she does in her book where is the dignity in that and what message what example is she sending out to other people
well as you say too much information in cherie's book you do see dignity remember seeing the mothers of some of these young men that get stabbed or shot appearing outside the court these are people who have never been in front of camera
one huge example
situation i would be able to show
the problem is with the paparazzi with the kind of paparazzi you didn't have twenty years ago who go for undignified shots with the culture of reality tell vision as
performers and as you say the paparazzi are everywhere now there is a lot of you get a lot of celebrities moaning and chingeing about being followed but it's what we put our sfrlz out there for if you put your head above the parapet you have to accept that for a while i moaned about the press it's only with hindsight and looking back certainly by writing my own bok and helpfully being honest and trying to be dignified when you're being honest and you're maybe telling things about that have happened in your life you're hoping you're not hurting other people by doing that you face that chance of being seen as undignified
did that bring you back from feeling indignity to behaving in a
michael you're an example of that too that terrible election night for you in ninety seven you were seen to be dignified in defeat for many people that was the start of a changed perception for you
yes in a way i would say well thank you any way l. would say to lez because he said what frank field did was brave in a way i would say the opposite n. a way to dot dignified thing is sometimes the simple thing
maybe not to have done what he did in the first place
when i lost my seat i saw david mellor in a scrap with jimmy goldsmith at his result just before mine l. thought it's got to be different from that l. had an example to work off
not to be i'm afraid dianne since you can't remember my name either the book is called
must the show go on
the answer is it must
but it must end tonight obviously

and in schools up and down the country
hello i'm jeremy vine and this is panorama don't these words bring happy memories flooding back to you
right children i want you to put your pens down
it's exam season again but are some of our children being tested too much too young
as a parent with an anxious child you're thinking to yourself well god are they really necessary
yes says the government the exams are good for children and teachers but there's mounting evidence against them
tell me about your s. a. t.'s exams in a month's time please
scary scary
rrrarrgh
there are lies damn lies and school league tables
well it's going to be a testing week not just for children but also for the government's education policy too eleven year olds all over england will be sitting their s. a. t.'s this week they took them at seven they will take them again at fourteen and of course they'll have loads of exams after that but the tests themselves so dear to the government's heart are coming under heavy challenge in wales they've scrapped them they say they don't miss them now m. p.'s are about to deliver their verdict vivian white reports praise you by fatboy slim
i'm going to give the certificates out now i'm going to ask people to come out and receive their certificate well done jennifer
the phoenix primary school is holding its weekly praise assembly everyone is here not just children and teachers but parents and whole families
now a senior group of m. p.'s is declaring on the teachers' side
there's something wrong with the amount of testing and assessment we're doing the quality of the testing and assessment and the unseen consequences of it on the whole school culture
these are some of the children the row is all about
these are the children who are going to sit s. a. t.'s in a couple of weeks they're all on tenterhooks at the moment they're doing a lot of revision work at present for core subjects english maths and science
what he most dislikes is that the s. a. t.'s results get published the government says that's accountability and then they're ranked into league tables the phoenix is in the bottom fifth of liverpool's primaries
we don't moan too much we're trying to improve so that we move up the table but i have to say that we are competing against schools from leafy suburbs where you know children start off with better life chances than our kids have
the school emphasises that it's inclusive with places for special needs children in ordinary classes which affects its results as well opened in two thousand two in a regeneration area the phoenix could be a government showpiece but its teachers don't like the s. a. t.'s or targets they're part of
they're good for the government because the government can publish tables in autumn and then i think possibly major politicians can then bang their shoe on the table and say we will not suffer underperforming schools
but the government says s. a. t.'s are fair to everybody who's got a stake in education
s. a. t.'s are there to give pupils an understanding of how they're doing nationally to let parents see how well their child is doing and how well the school is doing and for the public to be able to see how well schools generally and the school system as a whole is performing
s. a. t.'s began in nineteen ninety one three systems of accountability the tests a set national curriculum and inspections by ofsted are all tightly linked together
i bet you i bet you i'll do it
the ofsted inspectors recently visited the school they praised its rich and stimulating curriculum and said parents rated the school highly
i would like people to know what a good school we've got here what great teachers we've got fantastic teaching support and the best children around come on becky you going up i'll never get a go
but the ofsted inspectors weren't satisfied with the s. a. t.'s results not only that they told the pupils so in a letter they wrote to them
during your time at school your achievement and progress are satisfactory however the standards you reach by the end of year six are well below average
it hurt a lot it hurt a hell of a lot that particular sentence describing standards as below average i don't think children should have been given that in a letter
because i mean it was a fact
what child it was a fact what child at the age of eleven needs to be told that they're below average that's not how we teach
let's have a look at another one then
the inspectors said must do better so frank bunting who teaches year six felt the pressure
sixty seven sixty seven well done
frank's one of the school's most experienced and successful teachers but the s. a. t.'s don't just test the children they test their teacher and the school
lots of other teachers would say just the same as mr. bunting but is the problem that teachers don't like s. a. t.'s because they'd like to run the show themselves according to their rules is that what they really mean
this creature eats information from your brain
yeah
goodness me is that what you feel is happening to your brain at the moment
yeah
his name is the s. a. t. vulture he rips your body in half and eats your guts if you've been really really bad
what do you think about exams
i think they're like good like they're good for your education
why do you think that
like people think it's like boring but you have to do it to get to your next year
here we have our therapeutic
goodness me
chill out room it has a variety of purposes
there's a wigwam this is a wigwam
some children like to feel surrounded by comfort and cosiness
and children just like adults don't always say what it is that's worrying them
s. a. t.'s testing numbers numbers a bit more
i'm sure they must be necessary otherwise they wouldn't do them but as a parent with an anxious child you think to yourself well god are they really necessary
what's your view of them and why
i do think they are a good thing to do it tells you where they're at obviously i worry as a parent but i'm not i don't worry too much like conor is quite calm about it
does lois tell you what it's like at school each day
oh god aah told you
school is preparing you for life and life can be pretty stressful there's a certain amount of that is not a bad thing but it has to be in a safe context i talk to children who are in the process of taking tests in most schools the process is managed very well and children don't notice hugely that they're taking national tests as opposed to the other tests
it is a snapshot of where children are at a given point in their education
that's our killer question s. a. t.'s have made well they've narrowed the curriculum they've harmed creativity in schools and primary schools for very little worth
bad for education narrowing for the curriculum and it's not just mr. bunting saying that the schools select committee at westminster have been doing their homework too
the range of evidence that we took was very broad indeed most of the evidence that i saw both in terms of written evidence and the oral evidence that we took leant in the direction of being sceptical about the value of testing to the extent that we test in this country
a major study of studies a review of all the academic research clearly concludes that s. a. t.'s are de motivating for children it's co author is a senior professor
every piece of evidence that i looked at in my review pointed in this direction they're spoiling children's enjoyment of education and that's absolutely central to their motivation to continue learning to enjoy it and to continue it throughout life
and the professor says she knows the s. a. t.'s monster very well indeed
the s. a. t.'s monster is that thing that looms ahead of them unfortunately for many children because of all those practice tests every time you have a test and you come out lower than someone else you are told it's a way of telling you that you are less able that you are a low achiever that you are less worthwhile
but these children are having fun we heard the sound of music up the corridor and asked if we could join this group
what's your favourite food what's your favourite food corn sausages and marshmallows corn sausages
right year six we're going to do this morning last year's non calculator numeracy paper
forty five minutes open your books and begin
i'll give you another ten minutes ten minutes left see if you can remember what that word obtuse means children you've got five minutes left
right children i want you to put your pens down please if you're still writing and i want you to close your books in front of you
people are concentrating on teaching to the test they're only doing the sorts of questions that appear in tests particularly in year six so that the whole range of things you could be doing in maths which includes working with computers solving real problems solving mathematical problems all those things are actually being ignored because you're practising solving very short written questions and that does spoil maths teaching it makes it less exciting both for teachers and children
but the government points to a rise in the number of children aged eleven reaching pass standard in the core subjects hasn't the government got a point haven't the tests helped
the tests have certainly pushed up the results in the tests i mean you would expect that after the initial few years when teachers got familiar with what was required they've got very good at coaching children for the test as soon as that happened the test results don't go up much more as you've got to the ceiling
the burden of evidence that reached the select committee saying that s. a. t.'s were harmful and the academic evidence saying they de motivate children do you accept or reject it or are you blind to it
i've looked at some of the academic studies i've looked at who the select committee chose to give evidence against to take evidence from and i think there is a more balanced picture in the end i look at results i look at the fact that results are improving year on year for eleven year olds for fourteen year olds they in turn are reflected in gcse results and a level results again improving year on year standards in schools are rising and part of the reason for that are tests and tables
we have children here aged five to seven
like a pain in the neck no i shouldn't have said that isn't the claim for the system
that s. a. t.'s are an objective external measure
they were a measure of what children do a snapshot in time under stress we all know that children and adults under stress do not do their best
a labour government in wales took a key part of the education policy of the labour government in london and well they blew it away and took the teachers' side
in terms of the evidence it was quite clear that we had to enable our teachers to be able to be free of the teach to test culture teach to test and also drilling to reach the test demands now that of course we knew wasn't effective wasn't enabling our teachers to be productive in the classroom
so as soon as you're ready and you've got your map off you go and find a space in which you can orientate and set your map
year six at bryn deva have got orienteering with their class teacher helen wyndham evans
four three two one go
it's not a question of being let off as teachers we're professionals we're here to get the best out of our children to help them learn in the best possible way
his name is mathsimo he's good at maths he loves insects and flies around
what do you think about tests good they're good yeah no ifs no buts no
it's called allsorts he's friendly and funny and playful and he likes to eat spaghetti and pasta
what about tests do you like them dislike them what do you think about tests
tests oh erm yeah i like them
standards are good key stage one and two are coming through very well the chief inspector was impressed in his recent report in terms of grade i excellence developing across wales
in the same report the chief inspector also warned that standards of attainment are levelling off it's early days yet do you ever go to wales minister
i occasionally pop over the border into wales
the westminster government says it's not anti teacher and it's floating a new exam
we can move to a system we hope whereby we can trust teachers' judgement a little better and we are currently piloting making good progress which is testing when ready single level tests as opposed to the current system whereby we test at seven eleven and fourteen
and the new system's intended to be more child friendly so we went down to the seaside to see how it's working out facing the sea in essex is mersea island its primary school is one of over four hundred schools piloting these single level tests this school's got news for the government it's a foundation school in a prosperous area with an independent minded head she's sceptical about s. a. t.'s because of the pressure they bring she was keen to try out the new improved version some of these cats have also been guinea pigs
don't let me go don't let me go
year six science on air resistance the government's new system is designed to measure whether a pupil has moved up by one level of attainment children can be put in for the test from age seven in december or june when the teachers think they're ready so it's meant to be less pressured but this head teacher warns that if the new tests are still linked to targets and league tables there could be more pressure not less
if the target setting agenda the pressure to achieve constantly higher every year is applied to the single level testing system what you're doing is spreading the pressure down through the school down to year three who are only aged seven that will be very bad for the children and get in the way of their learning what i would really like is the people i suppose in government to start listening to the professionals on the ground which they do not do
right ready three two one
year six's science lesson comes down to earth this head's decided that the new tests risk bringing what she thinks are the worst features of s. a. t.'s to even more children the national association of head teachers takes her view and others do as well
single level testing that can take place at any time means that testing is ever present in the atmosphere of a school it is still a culture where the success of a child of a teacher of a school is linked to testing testing testing that is the problem
i look at all the evidence including what teachers tell us and i think we've got the right policy in terms of testing i'm looking forward to that policy evolving as we develop the pilot
in the future i want to be an engineer i will do all sorts of engineering and i will fix everything
i'd like to be a spy in the future i'd like to use a rocket powered backpack
i would like to be a comedian and have a hovercraft for a car
never mind we're gonna go out with a bang oh my god somebody's shot him chris and john get their final challenges vo vo vo voom we'll be showing you a few of the things that didn't quite go to plan what i've tried to do in this series is show you some of the different ways that we humans are involved with the natural world in other words there's not only some special wildlife there's also some very special people in the first show i challenged chris watson to reveal and record the sounds of silence meaning the wildlife that we may not have realised makes any sound at all ooh of course to do this chris had to employ some highly sophisticated technology
doctor who might have a sonic screwdriver but this is a sonic coat hanger
no they're not they're really really very vocal birds
but i've never heard that i've seen one hundred puffins gathered together all looking as though they should be gabbling away and yet i'm listening i can't hear anything
well you need to get the mics in close now have a listen
this now this is that mic down there oh my goodness well i was right about the wings
the wing sound's really powerful that's something i didn't expect
oh yeah
vo vo vo voom
but in films often people sort of fabricate sounds to go with particularly wing sounds of birds in flight
it's the old wet flannel job isn't it like this
whereas now we've got the real thing
which is better
um let me think it's perfect this being able to listen closely but observe from a distance
it is isn't it
that's that's sorry you just can't help but smile when you hear that
i've not seen them do it no
one of the things is that a lot of these birds when they come in have a beak full of sand eels yeah and if they were to open their beak to make any noise they'd lose 'em all i just want it to do a tap dance now get a bit of rhythm going it likes it though look at that it's nice and cosy on my toes whoa he's jumped off oh that's perfect they're discussing your microphone now
i think that's coming from underground that long rolling call is being made by adults down in the burrows because underneath under the surface of this colony is just a honeycomb of tunnels and burrows so this sound percolates up through the ground
of course actually recording underground is gonna require a very specialised piece of equipment would i be right in assuming that this technique will involve a wire coat hanger
funny you should say that from my luxury one star hotel room this morning
now we've not only got a tiny mic down there we've also got something i've never seen before a puffin chick in its burrow
i love this bit we'll put the headphones on and fade up cos you never know what you'll hear nothing there's a bird crossing with sand eels
is that it just run across it's disappeared this could be going underground oh there chick let's face it that's your standard chick i'm hungry noise isn't it
yeah insistent
what the dickens was that a squeal
that's a puffin chick it's a real sort of wail yeah
incredible that was a scream that scared the life out of me
ha that's great
ah well that's puffins for ya not only look good they sound good if you can hear them thanks chris a pleasure and the puffins agree that's puffin language for it's been a pleasure chris so if chris is my ears in this series then my eyes come courtesy of cameraman john aitchison
woar
over the weeks i've set john some pretty tricky challenges and he's risen to the occasion on um well most of them so for john's swansong not a swan because they're the easiest thing to film but what do you think is the hardest
the hardest animal mm now that would be difficult probably the fox badger fox the red kite
probably the otter probably be a bird
the wild cat in scotland
eagles dormouse
birds of prey are probably the hardest gosh it's difficult isn't it
it's there it's easy go on get it
can't see it at the moment oh gone really hard now it's very quick you can find it in the wide and then crash in very quickly
that's difficult they're very fast
of course it's difficult that is the whole point righty o. then so this week's cameraman challenge is to capture dragonflies in flight yeah of course first secret of being an ace cameraman be at the right place at the right time
so here i am middle of the day and a great place loads of water sunny day as well which should be good for dragonflies so let's see what's here if you like to gamble i tell you i'm your man you win some lose some it's all the same to me they change direction so quickly if they decide they want to go that way they go whoom and i can't do that with this cos this has some drag on it so i'm gonna have to slacken it right off so i can be as flexible as a dragonfly they're so much quicker than me it's just hopeless i haven't got reaction times like a dragonfly
i think a little encouragement is called for don't you
come on john come on john
come on john
you can do it john i've gotta find another way to really get to grips with them flying
they're so much quicker than i am
they're much quicker than everybody
oh this is good just down here there's a darter that's quite a small dragonfly very beautiful but what i've noticed is it's using the same perch so hopefully if i just keep it framed like this it'll fly away there it goes and then instead of following it i'll anticipate it there we are straight back to the same place i'm not sure bill will count that as a flight shot although it was flying wasn't it oh wow look at that beautiful colours these are emperor dragonflies and that's the male they're mating that's the male with the blue colour on his abdomen and the female's the greener one i think they're the biggest in britain they really are spectacular and look at the size of its eyes they're the biggest eyes of any insect which of course helps them find prey and it also helps them to see each other when they're patrolling these ponds round here and its wings beautiful like stained glass windows without the colour i don't think the mating dragonflies count as flight shots do they bill
well no but they're great
absolutely fine whatever works
yes this is good well that's sort of working so that's them slowed right down wow they're just amazing they fly so well i'm full of admiration for dragonflies having watched them carefully how they're flying it's been a fantastic challenge but probably the hardest thing i've ever had to film
john said in an earlier programme that one of the things he tried to do is find the art in nature the art the science the music the fun all those things that enrich our life that we get from wildlife that's what this series has been about it hasn't always been easy animals simply don't stick to the script i'm here to tell you folks these are terribly good gardening gloves but they're not entirely vole proof and let's face it neither does the presenter
no go again
you ain't seen me right that's more or less the end of this reel which it isn't it's going pretty well i think oink oink all right i have to accept some of my faculties are not what they were i can't hear anything can you hear that no ah chris watson is at this very moment risking life and limb to set up microphones so he can record a particularly talented oak oh my god somebody's shot him but chris recovered to bring us a t. v. first
it's absolutely amazing
the sound of wasps chomping making paper for the nest you heard it here first and john had a first too
oh yes
and all three species under one tin
amazing oh amazing look at that
and as always with wildlife there was the thrill of the totally unexpected blimey well i've never seen that before what the dickens are they fighting about they're obviously basically trying to drown one another kittiwakes are always regarded as one of the calmest sweetest most harmless little birds the sort of doves of the gull world look at these two though whoo and there was not only gratuitous violence there was also gratuitous cuteness
you are here so am i maybe millions of people pass by but they all disappear from view and i only have eyes for you
sometimes you have to use field craft you have to be subtle and stealthy otherwise birds will just meld into the forest actually would you believe golden pheasants can be really hard to see well not this one a glistening jewel of the orient in an english woodland or a chinese takeaway to mr. fox
i like the idea with these foxes that because we're more or less in basildon that maybe they're basildon brush that's terrible isn't it
john you stick to the camerawork i'll do the naff jokes they are um rather en deer ing i'm sorry i'm sorry i got so far oh deer deer oh i've done it again and i'll do the comedy falls so that's it for this series of wild side is it goodbye or is it au revoir a bientot sayonara bis dann
when will i see you again when will we share precious moments will i have to wait for ever will i have to suffer and cry the whole night through when will i see you again when will our hearts be together are we in love or just friends is this my beginning or is this the end when will i see you again
buddy is a bully who treats owner sam like his bitch
you think wouldn't it be easier if he accidentally gets run over
ruff and tumble are two tiny dogs with one great big hit list
i'm shaking now look
the owners of these dogs are at their wits' end it's time for extreme measures this is the last resort for bad dogs set up on a secure ten acre compound in a remote part of the english countryside dog borstal is run by three of britain's toughest trainers
never met a dog i can't train
each trainer will take on separate dogs in an attempt to reform them in just four days using their own individual training methods
i'm talking to you my goal is to shift the power balance back in favour of the owner
but the owners have to face harsh truths
your dog started it you could be prosecuted under the dangerous dogs act
for these dogs their delinquent ways are about to come to an end this is buddy a beagle cross whose owner sam rescued him from a dogs' home sam dreamed of a marriage made in heaven instead she's found herself trapped in an abusive relationship
stop it buddy leave it if he was a human he'd be a seventeen year old yob with a hoody on a baseball cap on and go around stealing cars running out but because he helps his mum with the shopping everybody thinks he's wonderful the second i say get out his eyes glaze over he relaxes into his i'm going to stay here mood and as soon as i get near him he snarls and turns to i'm going to roll on the floor you'll not get me out of this room
buddy controls every inch of the house
this week i've probably had four five hours' sleep a night so far you just get used to sleeping in awkward positions
and in buddy's world what's hers is his
give them back out of all the clothes it's always the underwear he goes for stop it stop it it's really bad and embarrassing i don't know why he goes for it it's not just mine it's anybody's
in her desperation sam secretly harbours a morbid fantasy
for buddy it's time to swap home comforts for borstal life
it's really like a prison all right boy it's all right cheer up
attempting to reform him is trainer robert alleyne an experienced behaviourist who can read a dog's mind like a book
in borstal owners must live apart from their dogs
say your goodbyes don't make them too long cos that stresses the dog try not to stop and have backward glances because it's even more stressful for the dog
i didn't feel at all bad about leaving him in the kennel it's revenge for the treatment he's caused me i know i'm different to everyone else but if you knew buddy you'd understand it's freedom buy me diamonds and rubies i'm crazy about bentleys gucci dresses and drop top kompressors wine me and dine me bring those platinum rings those are a few of our favourite things
this is ruff and tumble two pampered chihuahuas on their way to the park
i've always loved small dogs and i just thought they'd be like normal ordinary dogs you know they'd be able to sit with you when you have coffee when you're out people come up and stroke them and think they're lovely
it's a lifestyle that owner xavier and partner gary aspire to but ruff and tumble don't share the same dream
i've got one that's really nice and one on an asbo aren't you ruffy he likes to snap at people um what else do you do you run and bark at people you're just mad aren't you
and ruff has a hit list of people he's out to get
he doesn't like children
he hates joggers ruffy
oriental women for some reason people with hats on
but if there's one thing ruff really hates it's a dog that's bigger than he is and unfortunately today there's a dog party
if he avoids all that i'll be absolutely amazed who let the dogs out woof woof woof woof who let the dogs out woof woof woof woof stop hey sssh
not satisfied with gate crashing the party ruff decides to pick a fight with the bouncers
ruff hey dogs yap come here
the party is ruined
hey hey ow ow
come here come here
he got bit sssh sssh exhausted i want to go home stressed out
for ruff and tumble dog borstal isn't going to be a walk in the park they're about to meet lynne davies a fearless dog trainer who can turn the most antisocial delinquents into pussycats
xavier hi hi i'm lynne i'm gonna be your trainer for this week dog in right we're gonna get on like a house on fire
in your bed ruffy in your bed go on go on back stay argh dogger
that's great xavier
for buddy ruff and tumble the week ahead isn't going to be a holiday buddy stands accused of beating up his owner sam
this is probably the most difficult case i've had
and ruff and tumble are serving time for mounting a campaign of terror
it's no good saying the guy needs control of his dogs you need to have control of your dogs
which of these dogs will earn their freedom it's the first day of training and no one's slept very well over at the kennel block trainer robert goes to collect buddy for his first training session
take him off that way
robert believes playing together is key to a good relationship
go on then good boy soon as he picks it up call him back straight away
come on boy buddy good boy come here come on boy
what i've got to work in here is the way sam interacts with buddy cos she's not exciting and animated enough and when she talks to him she asks him if he'd mind if it's not too much trouble buddy would you come and he says it usually is too much trouble
come on boy buddy good boy come here
i've had cases in the past where the owner and dog weren't necessarily well connected but this is the first where they're not connected but neither seems one hundred per cent interested in being connected anyway they're like i could just go and find somebody else and buddy is going i wouldn't mind if you did so for me this is a tough one and i have to be honest and say i'm not optimistically going to get there
that's that dog that bit him that dog a rotty look at this the guy's got two of them look where is he he's not even there controlling them and he bit him
but lynne has no sympathy
that was caused by your dog and it's no good saying the guy needs control of his dogs you need to control your dogs your dog started it went over there out of control it started as a game your dog pushed it too far the rottweiler said i'm not having that the fact your dog's small your dog gets hurt you're over protective of your dog just the same as the rottweiler owner i want you to realise how important and how vital it is that this is dealt with you could be prosecuted under the dangerous dogs act
lynne sends xavier to collect his dogs
dog out
ruff seems to be behaving himself
he is being very different to usual
but lynne isn't fooled she's about to deliver some devastating news for a doting lapdog owner
i want you to try for the rest of the week not to pick either dog up
what about a cuddle get on the floor and give them a cuddle
lynne is worried about xavier's position within the pack
ruff wants to elevate his status just putting his paw on your knee he's promoting himself to a dominant position what is the highest point in your kingdom at home
my head he sits on my head of course he does or goes on the back of the sofa course it's not acceptable
as far as he's concerned he's top dog on your shoulders overlooking everything he doesn't understand he's confused
with lynne on the case ruff's days as pack leader are numbered lynne isn't happy about the noise levels in the kennel block it's time to reveal her secret weapon the water bottle
you are gonna have that water bottle with you constantly now you're coming away from the kennel one starts or both start i want you to walk straight back to the kennel go no and chuck the water then walk away again if you do that consistently the dogs will stop barking in the kennel
bad dogs buddy ruff and tumble are serving time at borstal
no in twenty four hours they must sit a test to prove they're reformed
but will any of them pass robert has summoned buddy's owner sam to his office
come in when we're out training there is something i feel that's getting in the way
i think to be honest with you i honestly think he i'm not the right owner for buddy and i think i've always felt that i think he needs somebody probably male younger sort of thing he just seems to be like a bloke's dog
clearly there is a relationship problem between you the reality is you have buddy and i have my dog and we make the best of it that we can which is what everybody does i want you to stop thinking of yourself as not good enough for buddy so from this moment on you are the right owner for buddy
right you are going to provide all the things buddy needs yes
you can do everything buddy wants you to do you've just got to believe it
robert leaves sam to think about what he's said meanwhile lynne has a surprise for ruff just three days ago the sight of another dog would send him barking mad
it's time to confront his demons
he's seen her but not interested oh yeah no
ruff's resolve finally crumbles
close close
lynne presses on
ready yep good lad fetch it good boy good boy that's a good boy
but ruff has got the message he's no longer reacting to the other dog
ready yep speak hup good boy get it yeah good la a a a ad exercise complete praise that dog good boy
finished you've finished
good lad
for xavier it's all too much
good emotion yeah good you can see how well he can do yeah just i dunno really it just really hit i feel like a prat now
outside
at home obedience is not one of buddy's strong points
outside come on boy
for owner sam it's time to stop asking and start telling him what to do
when you're not happy with what he's doing rather than gently guiding him back saying i'd like you to be here he says but i don't wanna do that as soon as you move off he just does that again i want you to tell him you're not happy do you know what buddy it's you and me now when i tell you to get back here you'll get back here
do i yank him back i want you to yank him back
make it unpleasant enough that he thinks i don't like that maybe i won't do that again
come on buddy buddy
unknown to sam there's a dead rabbit by the side of the road buddy will have already picked up its scent and being a beagle cross won't be able to resist pulling in its direction
come buddy
there he's pulling now and he's pulling there
that's it good boy she's just starting now to tell him that she means it
rather than asking him but this is not something that's natural for sam and buddy knows it so if she gives him an inch he takes it
good boy uh
no he wasn't a good boy cos that was tight then he was a bad boy
it's getting the timing right timing is everything
uh
mind the dead rabbit that's a real distraction
i didn't even see it cos i was watching him i would've walked into it good boy buddy this is much better sam good a million times better good boy
it's time for the ultimate challenge buddy must stand next to the rabbit without his head going down
leave stand him close enough that he could grab it
leave leave
look he jumps over it yeah
good boy come straight towards me uh good boy put him in a sit sit good boy what do you think i think that was amazing he is a normal dog
i think she's gone from feeling really negative this morning to probably now feeling pretty positive and i've gone from feeling really negative this morning to feeling a little less negative
it's judgment day for the dogs and their owners in under an hour they face the final test and for buddy's owner sam there's some unexpected news
from this point on the trainers are powerless to intervene will their dogs be sent home in shame even family members have turned up to find out
there you go boys who's that it's dadda dadda number two
the test will be judged by ryan o'meara a breed expert who's trained thousands of dogs his word is final in deciding who will graduate from dog borstal
no
a week ago ruff terrorised the neighbourhood
he doesn't like women for some reason
people with hats on any other dogs no
and he never let his size get in the way of picking a fight
good boys
and just like at home this park is full of ruff's pet hates
heel
first ruff and tumble must pass between two women in hats only to find themselves face to face with another dog
good boys that's good boys come on wait
heel
but can ruff hold his nerve
tumble there's a good boy
it's gone better than i imagined thank you lynne
good boys
well done right now have a walk down there
i've watched 'em and i have news do you think it's good news yeah yeah course it is hey well done thank you very much it's a pass and it's a pass with distinction oh brilliant you got a near perfect score and i almost feel bad for saying it's near perfect the reason is they didn't do anything wrong to let you prove yourself they did everything absolutely spot on
how did you do
bend down that's it pass with distinction
well done you give us a hug thank you very much well done
last up is buddy back home buddy ruled the roost with an iron fist leaving owner sam scarred both mentally and physically
outside
pleased to meet you best of luck
the judge must decide if buddy has turned over a new leaf
if you can relax as much as you can what we're going to do to start with i want to walk him close enough to some of the toys so he could steal them and we're going to be looking to see if buddy does go for anything how you manage it and how he responds so in your own time
buddy has to walk right over the toys
leave leave leave
oh he nearly had the tiger she had to make him leave it
leave leave leave good boy
nearly went for monkey too now he's got to walk past the food box buddy likes his food
can we go nice and slow past the food please
the important thing is for buddy not to help himself to what he wants
leave leave
he is just trying to sniff i don't think from here he's trying to grab them
leave good boy
finally sam must towel buddy down something he's never let her do before back home it's a battle that buddy always wins has anything changed
so that's test over and i have no idea if she's passed
it's the moment of truth have buddy and sam done enough
taking their time good boy
well sam good news
i thought so your dog's done you proud
and i'm delighted to tell you that you've passed passed with distinction
yes wow buddy did you hear that boy
somebody's bribed the judge
a rosette hopefully the first of many thank you very much and a certificate to prove he really did do it he did phenomenally well i'm very pleased congratulations
thank you very much
i've got something in my eye
it's been another tough week at borstal but the good news is all dogs have graduated on the streets of london are ruff and tumble still running wild
women children buggies passers by not interested anymore good boy a bit more obedient than this one coming out and having a coffee with 'em now is great i always think an animal should embellish your life and be a part of your life that makes it better and that's what they are now instead of being a part of my life that stresses me out they're the dogs that i wanted before you know heel there you go yeah it's great
and back home have buddy and owner sam finally found domestic bliss
welcome to b. b. c. secondary schools tonight we feature mad about music an inspirational introduction to the world of music enabling students to experience a range of styles and ideas from indian rhythms to japanese scales these lively documentary style programmes will encourage students to experiment with different styles and ways of making music
we all like heavy hard rock that's the main basic of the music but hip hop and all these kind of musics that are out there we listen to you just kinda wanna throw it into your music too let's go
when we write songs we start with a riff with a drumbeat with something and then we just build on it people keep adding their two cents throwing their ideas in
we got one guitar doing one thing the bass doing another horns on top that's what gives it a fusion
boop d. a. boop boop boop
you got a pop song and a biohazard type heavy riff in the middle
sometimes you can't even hear the bottom sax because you're so into
we've no boundaries so why should we we can add a horn cos no one cares
yeah yeah yeah looky here what i got for you
i can hear you inside screaming
feed me the juice there's nothing left for you to do i gotta get lost can't be sorry if these are good times yeah
if these are good ti i. imes
the words really never come first it's always music we feed off the musical idea and then develop words around that we get the influence for the song through the guitars bass drums whatever's coming out some bands might have a songwriter who says this is the words and everyone else learns it but when we write songs it's like seven people it's a fight this is my part take that out put this in hey man got some spare change for me brother all i need's a little something
you see me sitting here face to the gutter you pass me by you ride up high
the last one dead is a rotten egg may be better off out of it if these are good times
yeah
if these are good ti i. imes they make me wanna we're not queueing up for the bus let's go good times if these are good times yeah good times if these are good times come on come on now all we know we know yeah we know all we know we know yeah we know all we know we know yeah we know micheal has been composing for a number of years and we were preparing to do a concert and thought it would be nice if we could do a combined piece i would work on the rhythm and micheal on the melody
i think of crispy as a meeting of musical personalities um me on the one hand as a drummer micheal as a composer and a player of irish music the orchestra from a classical background ken with improvisatory skills on the saxophone so i suppose a combination of all those is a good example of fusion in music
i like to compose pieces which not so much use traditional music but use traditional musicians because they bring with them all of the ornamentation and the variation and all of the style of the things that traditional musicians do the sound of the flute for example the very sound you get out of it what i had in mind for today was just to try out a few things and see how they work with both your voices together here's the chords have you got some lyrics that we could try yeah
i look to horizons for a straight and even plan searching for tomorrows lurking inside the shadow's hand
if you wanna try any of those over this chord shape what i tried to achieve in this piece is actually to fuse two different styles to bring in denyse's commercial and western type of singing and mix that with jayante bose's more classical style from india you know you could keep this as a common tone try it with you coming in yeah that's it
hear the voice as it reaches to you
dhum dhum dhum dhum dhum
yeah go for it all right
hear the voices some of the rhythms are african rhythms i learned from guyana i'm gonna look to horizons for that safe and even plan searching for tomorrows lurking inside the shadow's hand hear the voice that reaches to you oh ease that worried mind hear the voice that reaches to you you're not the worrying kind thinking of a fantasy that reaches so far and wide free as the wind blows you have nothing nothing to hide yeah hear the voice that reaches to you oh ease that worried mind hear the voice that reaches to you you're not the worrying kind hear the voice that reaches to you oh ease your worries ease your worried mind yeah let it ease let it ease let it ease oh oh hear the voice hear the voice hear the voice yep i've finished
i was asked to do a piece called water combining the sound of running water and the string orchestra i was trying to get it to sound like that but it took me a while to suss out how to do it and eventually i sussed out that if you put a tracksuit into water and lift them out you get a much better sound than a toilet
on top of that dripping water sound that dave discovered he's given me this long violin solo it's quite repetitive it has these arpeggios which are scales that go up and down the first time i played it it wasn't sounding quite how david imagined it he asked me to visualise myself just sitting by a waterfall and that would be the trickling sound he said i should feel as though i was making up the notes and discovering them as i went along
voodoo chile by jimi hendrix the most important thing about hendrix is that he could make very ugly sounds incredibly beautiful the way he played was very extreme he wasn't at all frightened of making any sound that could be expressive when i wrote this piece gorbachev i used very much hendrix influenced guitar playing on the solo cello i got together with the cellist melissa phelps and we found the best way of getting the effects i was trying to get that's a bit too disgusting somewhere in between the two
i get it sounding too straight or too wild
it's to sound beautiful and ugly which is what hendrix used to do sombre cello
sometimes you don't get any sound
that's great that's the way the cello should sound classical players are taught all the time to make a beautiful sound then i come along and say can you make the most ugly sound some people find it very difficult but melissa makes it sound worse than i thought it was possible
it's not that it's ugly you just get more overtones it's just a different way of using the instrument and it's not a singing cello sound
last year a friend called kathy russell died of leukaemia i wanted to write a piece for her and two differing ideas came to me that sort of inspired the piece the first thing that came to mind was that my son ty was playing with a wind pipe in the garden it sounded beautiful but haunting it sounds like the last post on the trumpet it sounds like this
and then it sounds very heavenly because the violins come in very very high they're right up here
high solemn note and they go on
it all sounds very remote and very free and it's absolutely beautiful and then it moves into the cello solo which is the crocodile song
before kathy died she had sung ty the crocodile song from peter pan because ty had brought in his plastic crocodile at that time he wouldn't go anywhere without his crocodile and that goes like this after she had died that song really haunted me and i kept thinking about it never smile at a crocodile
no you can't get friendly with a crocodile
i wanted to make it a lot sadder so i put it in the minor and a lot slower
then he takes that solo in to the violin it's very interesting because it's still the crocodile song but it's got other influences dave's got into scottish music since he moved to scotland and he's listened to a lot of fiddle music and he's used some of their techniques he uses a thing called scotch snaps where i go it's just really expressive really beautiful the exciting thing about dave's writing especially for strings is that he's pushed back boundaries of the sounds that we can make i don't know many composers who want us to make sounds like this but dave really insists on it it's got to be hard and aggressive
give it even more stick go right up to the bridge i was on a train one night sitting opposite this irish guy who was drunk trying to play the violin he was going up to the bridge and everyone was telling him to shut up but wouldn't it be great to have a whole orchestra making that sound
when dave gave us the music for free the spirit he said that the beginning should be violent and then we have this bit where it gets faster and faster it sounds like a train chugging actually building up some speed i've never actually heard the sound before on the flute it's the alto flute so it's got a more resonant sound he makes it sound like those south american pan pipes he just blows incredibly hard you don't get a real note but you get harmonics and lots of spit at the beginning of the sound a sort of tuh sound
it's very exciting to play it's very short which is quite nice because you feel you get a huge amount it's like an explosion you get this huge amount of sound and experimenting with sounds but it's all over in about a minute
i don't really like discussing music because the music speaks to you or not i can give intellectual twaddle about this that or the other but if it doesn't move the person it's not really worth all the effort and so all my favourite musicians are people that when you listen to them sound very emotional whether it's john coltrane mozart or miles davis they speak to you there's no problem with it with celtic air i wanted to write a piece for kathy's memorial service and i hope that if she had heard it she would have felt it was a fitting tribute i'd like you to hear the final section which is the most emotional part and i hope it gets to you
i got a phone call from joss one day saying she needed a singer that could sound like an alien as she had this idea for an opera
did you mean to do the happen instead of happen to you did happ en the inspiration for this opera came from an account i read of a sixteen year old girl who was apparently abducted by aliens' one thing they did was warn her about the possible end of the world the possible destruction of our planet terrible things would happen to the earth cities would crumble mountains would fall the sun would turn black
and those are the words that i sing in the opera we recorded them forwards and then turned the tape round terrible things will happen to the earth it will blow up cities will crumble
and then we just turn it over here
it was a bit extreme wasn't it that last swoop it will blow up
we were looking for a way of conveying an alien language
i suppose i tried to imagine what an alien would sound like if it was talking to itself or just chattering i think i just i can't really remember actually i just did some very high that sort of thing little snippets mm like an eastern european alien
t. v. on
yeah looking back on the track for a little green bag got to find just that kind i'm losing my mind outta sight in the night outta sight in the day looking back on the track gonna do it my way outta sight in the night outta sight in the day looking back on the track gonna do it my way looking back looking for some happiness but there is only loneliness to fi i. ind jump to the left turn to the right looking upstairs looking behind
if you want music that works with the dance and don't construct the dance to follow the music then you need to get someone in to write music for you
lea anderson the featherstonehaughs' choreographer brought this tape a completed dance which she'd rehearsed to using sonic youth the american band just a record from their collection we've worked this way before where she rehearses to one piece of music and then i make my own piece of music to replace the original one as you can hear the music's quite violent passionate as is the dance
i told steve when he first saw these duets that i wanted to try and use some of the contradictory stances and arrangements of two people placed together that um that made for a relationship that you couldn't explain in words you can't say they've had an argument and are trying to make it up it's much more complicated than that as most relationships are i asked steve if he could help me make something that would retain this oddness within the duets
it takes a while to be able to um for a composer to look at dance and know what will help the dancer make it look more exciting or what can drag it back and make it look dull or boring so it's quite a difficult process working with a composer successfully
i think one of the most important things is not to swamp the dance not to kind of clash not to get too busy or distract from the movement i think the music should draw you into the movement
the repetitiveness of the music certainly helps the oddness and the instrumentation the strange little horn that sticks out and keeps going it digs into your brain and you find yourself as you're watching it moving with the music it's very very compelling music
yeah so love had died i just had to tune in and i heard the whole arrangement musically in my head i heard drums i heard pianos i heard strings'
my heart again do you have a bass here
i hear that i can hear big shiny dum dum
when i work with ashley i suppose we've developed a chemistry where he knows exactly the right mood and feel to give the sentiment of the lyrics and he just instinctively knows where to go
release is good but then i cannot fit the rest of the lyrics in i know you can i can't
then middle eight d. a. na na na na fa na nee
fah suddenly
na na na na show that i'll be
la la la na na na na show that i'll be
and this song is about someone or anyone who may have been smitten or been in a bad relationship and have dismissed the whole idea of relationships and love altogether then you meet someone and the whole thing starts to revive it's like resuscitation of the spirit and the emotions'
dah d. a. d. a. dum dah d. a. d. a.
no i got here
same drop here it comes
i felt the shame of a broken love affair you helped me release the pain your energy and spirit always make me smile when i feel like giving up oh damn
i felt the shame of a broken love affair you helped me release show show me yeah
me release show me
that sounds all right i reckon that will work it sounds wicked
fear can cause even the bravest to retreat a voice inside said patience now i know why yeah yeah yeah love had died but you brought me back to life you taught me how to smile again i felt the shame of a broken love affair you helped me release love had died but you brought me back to life you taught me how to smile again now i felt the shame of a broken love affair you helped me release our love has die no
repeat up take it home so you can come in and listen exactly and assess there's so much good stuff in there we keep that and just work with it
yeah i'll show you
glockenspiel flourish at the beginning there's not a lot happening so i wanted to inject some energy and perhaps a little tension into it so i put just a repeated c. in the viola i decided to use a stringed instrument there and immediately by doing that i think you wonder what's going to happen then i decided to give it more rhythm or spikiness so i put by doing that in a way that might make it appear as if the girl might be slightly troublesome they go off together and it feels more relaxed so i wanted to show that in the music i brought in a really lovely instrument the clarinet it gives a really warm feeling which is how i felt the two people felt warm about each other and i also chose a string quartet because that has such a huge range of different kinds of sounds and tones it goes really low from the cello and high up for the violins and everything in between when i got to the bit when they're turning and the lights are turning that seemed rather sad because they seemed very happy together but they were going to get split up i wrote a little sad moment but that seemed too sad so i tried to make it a little bit happier and to bring out the turning with all the lights and everything i put in triplets in the accompaniment for the rest of the piece everything's been that kind of feeling but now just to make a change and then putting that tune together with the triplets because this is a short film i had to find a really short theme that i could use in different ways to show different feelings because it's mostly sad i chose a falling theme all the notes actually go downhill which is a sad feeling except for when they are feeling happy and they're doing turning when it actually goes up i think the strongest emotional point in the film is when the girl is led away by the police it's really sad it's just very lonely you wonder what's going to happen funnily enough that's a stronger emotional feeling than when everybody's playing at once so in a way to do less actually can convey more even though it's only a few notes that was nice excuse me could you tell me where chester row is chester row um
yeah i'll show you
my name's howard greenhalgh i'm a music video director you may have seen some of my work things such as soundgarden suede sky high in the airwaves pet shop boys i wouldn't normally do this kind of thing today i'm doing something that i've never done before illustrating a piece of classical music saint john's passion by bach the reason why i'm doing this is to test myself to see what images that i come up with with a style of music that i've never worked with before i didn't want to know what the original use was for the music i didn't want to do something historical or religious i wanted to relate the music to something modern something more contemporary i think the music saint john's passion took me on a journey it seemed to me that the music was like climbing a mountain it had toil in it there was sweat and tears in it at the same time it had a passionate character to it those crescendos attracted me to the music the story is about different desires that people have a desire to be the fastest the strongest a desire to be attractive a desire to escape to get away from it all a rock hangs in the air it has only one desire not to fall a passion to be weightless if desire was a window through which we could look the rock would see itself as a bubble floating in the breeze power nothing happens in rugeley as of general rugeley's a dying town the large towns around are building up and we're shrinking down the reason i skate is because i love it skating is an artform it's different you worry about bills if you've got enough food whatever and that doesn't matter when you're skating cos it's just you it's a cool thing
this skate park is the only place for young people to hang out in rugeley matt boden and his mates are organising a skate and music festival
people in rugeley are surprised someone's doing this everyone's excited even if they hate skating something's going on
we'll go through what's going on we're organising this it's properly big isn't it it is gonna be big we talked to everyone everybody knows it's getting around fast i'm scared about the money that's my worry as well
it's three weeks to sort out about three grand
grand a week yeah so you know
robin is helping matt with the skate competition dan's organising photography and lefty is in charge of the artistic side which will include a tagging competition artificial degradation a local band have been booked to play me and danny write the lyrics and are vocalists
danny's my boyfriend he gets a bit aggressive but he's a peacekeeper
my relationship with tammy is important some of the material we use is elaborated from arguments and things like that
kilf only joined the band two weeks ago
i always wanted to try the base and i've been playing for a year i've never played in a band before i'm going to be nervous for the gig
not all skaters are in into nu metal so matt travels to tamworth to check out some alternative sounds
people want to skate to the music they like if they're a hip hop person they don't want metallica playing if they're a metallica fan they don't want to hear eminem
the band hasn't been together long but we're really tight we're trying to get things up and running and writing loads of tracks
i'd really like you all to play we'd love to do it
is the actual gig a competition or is just the skating
the skating's the competition the gig's just about having fun
enjoying music basically yeah
i've had to come up with a couple of ideas for flyers and run the by the organisers the design for the flyer is a photograph that i'd taken of a group of friends just posing it's just basically a silhouette of that picture
i'm putting some ideas together for a poster for the skate fest i searched for things to do with skating on the internet and i found some graffiti websites and i took different lettering off there and colours
i'm concerned about the weather because if it rains all the preparation will go down the pan we were thinking about covering it but it's proving too costly we were thinking of scaffolding and covers but it's not practical
one alternative is a local rock venue the red rose they've got the builders in
good to meet you grab a seat
on the one hand staging the event at the red rose would mean the bands would be in the dry but matt would have to rent skate ramps and protect them from rain
the big problem you've got is covering this area yeah
we have looked at a marquee but it's the cost right that was a really good meeting i'm really pleased but i'm really worried about two things financially we need to get the money sorted and we're on a short deadline
when they asked us to go to rugeley it was like oh i don't know that came as a big surprise to us the skating thing we weren't expecting it at all
marissa and jade also go to classes to learn street dancing and break dancing they're hoping they can give a dance performance
slowly slowly
unlike tamworth rugeley isn't famous for its street culture but there is one known break dancer who lives there
rockafeller skank by fatboy slim i learnt my break dancing from the internet and downloading stuff you couldn't get me off the computer for a while i wanted to do it properly i try and practise for two hours every day that's physically practising and researching some stuff and studying it every time you get a new move out it's a sense of achievement in what you do i'd love to participate in the festival just to see how the crowd reacts it means a lot to me
one of the ways matt hopes to finance the festival is by raising sponsorship
all right i'm matt how are you
got your e. mail so how's it going
we've got a lot to still sort out we've just come to talk about possible sponsorship for the event
sixteenth february yeah little bit late organising it we haven't got a budget to give you any cash to help but certainly we could help you with promotion we could give you some product to help you out give out your fliers you're late on getting the people my advice would be to get the fliers and posters out
later on this evening we're having a meeting with the designers and getting the final thing done printed next week
so there's no cash but at least matt's got some prizes for the competition
sorry sarah couldn't make it any ideas why
sarah couldn't come but sent her ideas in with a friend
the idea was to put graffiti in the background of the figure and not use colour
i've done some rough copies of an idea for just one design basically that's damn cool that's the big version when's the deadline tuesday
that's the latest because we want them sorted on wednesday
we really need to hurry up basically as it's in two days
dan has put together a photography team of fellow art students sarah beech and mark hendry
skating's important cos it's just creative and that's why i'm an artist as well art and skating have got a lot in common i've never run a festival as such or a photography team so it's a new thing but hopefully i'll learn what i like from it people don't expect it to happen hopefully it will happen and i'll put most of my effort into it rugeley's dying so it's something for everyone to do all my mates
artificial degradation are in crisis they've lost their drummer two weeks before the festival
we're having some auditions but we're having trouble picking a decent drummer so that's causing problems if we get that sorted by next week we'll be fine with a week's preparation we'll be great
after agonising they've decided to stage the event at the red rose lefty can complete the flier design and take it to the printers
that's fine
a few days later the fliers are being printed even though the team haven't raised enough money to stage the event what's more matt's gone missing
robin and lefty have to pick up the pieces and stand in for matt at a meeting at the bank
he did say he had some money but he had no idea we needed so much
so keep at it eh
in tamworth unaware that the festival is in jeopardy marisa and jade are rehearsing their dance steps
it's not that hard sometimes it looks really hard to so but some small steps we used to learn in primary school or when we used to go tap dancing you just put those bits in and if you put attitude into it it looks good
while robin and lefty become increasingly nervous that they won't pull it off the local paper's run an article featuring an interview with matt
there it is meet the person who is single handedly shady man single handedly what the hell is that amazingly all the organisation is being done by this teenager
he wasn't even doing it single handedly to begin with
can't believe that oh my god
half of that isn't true because he didn't put that
oh god i've got a few people helping me now and now he's left us in the lurch
the bands aren't properly organised yet we've got to book the marquee get the ramps all the supplies for the painting and he says he's organised all that but he hasn't has he
we got seven days from tomorrow
yeah it's not a lot is it
what we gonna do oh no oh god
that weekend at the skate park matt turns up out of the blue what's going on now
it just needs more sorting out i ain't got much time as i had got the quote on the marquee which is two thousand two hundred which we can't afford so i'm thinking renting the ramps out and going too pitch if it's sunny we keep on going with the music and ramps
if it rains that's three thousand wasted put faith in the weather some people might be coming for the ramps they'll still be there
if it rains then you know people know the score got to make sure it's either the marquee and no ramps or ramps and no marquee
with only a few days to go matt abandons the idea of hiring a marquee not enough money then at the last minute a donation comes in from the prince's trust weather permitting it looks like the festival can go ahead
rumour's been going round that it's been cancelled but it's not i still think it's gonna be great it's a great thing to do but i know it's a lot more work and it's not a ride in the park sorting it out
i'm sweeping all the surfaces and stuff needs to be cleaned if people skate they hit pebbles and they'll fall over so we're just making sure it's all clean the weather forecast's come up really well finger's crossed it will be cool
i feel relieved to know the majority of it's done
we were a bit concerned about the morning i'm glad we cancelled the cover cos it's pretty damn nice weather it should be good
we didn't think it would happen no
i've just been sorting out prizes while you've been playing about first prize is the skates i've got a goody bag for them
blue goody it's a large the kids will be pretty small i've got a smaller one
i'm feeling pretty cool cos it's all coming off there's been trouble for three months sorting everything out sometimes it gets on top of you i can't be arsed with this i'm looking forward to tomorrow
the ramps are up but it's not all going to plan the sound engineer hasn't arrived
i'm feeling nervous i've got butterflies in my stomach you know
i'm feeling so nervous it's unreal but i'll give them what i got
finally the sound engineer turns up artificial degradation never did find a new drummer but their old drummer has stepped in the photography team are reduced to two sarah never materialised lefty has made a graffiti design to inspire people to compete in the tagging competition john is briefing the security team
everything should go sweet as a nut
five four three two one
sunday morning
you're terrible you are
what's gonna happen when you're on your own what you gonna say when i catch you what you gonna say what you gonna do
working as a lyrical preacher i'm just trying to reach ya i can feel it getting sweeter and sweeter i'm quite surprised how many people wanted to do it actually all my mates had a go all the girls had a go i'm really surprised the night before i had horrible images of nobody turning up we've been lucky it's all gone really well oh oh oh who're you gonna give it to who you gonna steal from come on who you gonna run to oh no it's not what you say
it's what you do you probably think this song is about you
don't you don't you don't you
are you into music film dance or art if you are between thirteen and nineteen ring or visit our website at
this doctor says that her child had gone to school but she has no idea how he isment
well the authorities here say that their top priority is still trying to save lives but we're now seventy two hours after the earthquake and it is very difficult to see anyone else now being pulled out of the wreckage and really a lot of effort now is being focused more on helping the survivors there are thought to be millions of them many of them living in refugee camps they have no real access to food or water and they're living in make shift tents the focus now on helping them to get through the coming days and weeks
what about international aid is that starting to make an impact
why so many people were trapped in school buildings what questions are they asking dan
that's right and in fact i was at one of the school buildings the other day in dujiangyan it had collapsed trapping an unknown number of children inside the wreckage although parents were hoping some of their children children would be brought out alive rescue workers were just bringing out bodies and there was anger there anger about the school anger about the quality of the construction now we don't know for certain if that is actually a factor or not as yet it is too early to say but it is very interesting to see that the authorities have announced this inquiry into why so many school buildings collapsed and they have said if they find anyone had used poor construction standards in the building of those schools they will punished
i want to speak to the manager
britain to know that you actually live beside a noisy road or a noisy road or a noisy airport but they have excluded so many things for instance football grounds we have yet to find one of those on the noise map
that's why we have undertaken this exercise and it will provide the local authorities who work in partnership with government to set up practical plans in which we can see noise levels reduced
the daily mail is reporting on this story about barack obama when asked a question by a journalist he responded with in moment sweetie the reporter decided to reported then he'd then she got the message on her answer phone from barack obama
twenty three online noise not will be launched today let us talk to john stuart from the u. k. noise association is this something you welcome
we welcome it in the sense that it gives information the real thing of the government asked to take action to reduce norris
what sort of issues do you have with norway's
the three big noises that regularly caught our traffic noise aircraft rise and never was we want to see some kind of national strategy to tackle noise the goldman has been tackling it for many years now at night the government
at these noises on the new maps
the do not cover everything they cover ambient noises but they do not cover noisy neighbours the fact there may be a noisy cafe or clock down the road
have you had look at these new noise maps
i have they give a fair bit of information information on its own without accent really does not get us anywhere
the government says this is just the start simply having information is useful and from that you can build a practical plan to tackle noise
you complaining about the noise in their area at
we do norway's regularly tops the list of complaints of local authorities noise we need a national strategy to tackle noise it could affect all sorts of information about planning loring trafford knives etc

the last surviving pilot from the dam busters mission will today return to the derbyshire reservoir at where air crews drained before dropping their bouncing bombs new zealand air les munro will watch new zealander it was the mission which used bouncing bombs to destroy huge dams in germany's industrial heartland this was just one of the many practice runs ahead of what is probably the most memorable raid in r. a. f. history and against all the arts the mission was success it made six hundred seventeen squadron world famous the board's it took part in the raid took off from here in lincolnshire beforehand the crews were sitting around on the grass playing cards or kicking a football around then one hundred thirty three of them took to the air fifty three died on a mission their names are here on a special memorial in the shape of their target the planes which took part in the rate were lancaster us this is one of only two still flying today it will fly over there went dam in derbyshire used as a pack there were the rate bare went dam one of the most important jobs was that of the bomb ama bare
went down he had to make
this and fly that down at sixty f. t. at night it was one of the most incredible pieces of flying skill
you'll ever see especially in massively tired of bali
incredible find skilled will be honoured again over it and which played a rather unusual park in the second world war over at dam we will be live at the rows of war in the next hour reservoir why is it the end of the line for thousands of phone boxes
in this cambridgeshire village they have only got one phone box but now it could be removed along with thousands of others across the country morals are relying on one of these so do we need to step inside one of these anyway with
everyone is so excited the mood in portsmouth is just bubbly
driving into portsmouth yesterday the thing that struck me was the number of of flags and scarves and that i saw as i was driving around the city is it fair to say that that reflects the mood
the final we get nothing out of the final unless we win it if we win it there is bonus of one million i don't think anyone is thinking of the match in terms of one million they're thinking about trying to win the cup
to go with a club like cardiff to the f. a. cup final and not going there just to make up the numbers
they maybe underdogs but city played descent football to reach the final about time the f. a. cup made another trip to wales it promises to be quite a contest tomorrow and history will be made whoever wins it there is cracking contest going on at lords between england and new zealand the kiwis will resume on two hundred eight for six after a topsy turvy day yesterday s. bowlers were on top at one stage new zealand one hundred nine for five but the kiwis bailed out by brendon mccullum who hit ninety seven before falling to monty panesar dwain chambers will give a list of the performance enhancing drugs he took in two thousand three to britain's anti doping authorities in letter obtained by b. b. c. sport the athlete was given seven separate banned substances andy murray celebrated his twenty first birthday yesterday by beating beating rafael nadal and jonathan howson struck in injury time to give leeds a win in their league one semi leeds won on the night jonathan howson had earlier equalised it is southend or doncaster in the final at wembley which seems at an appropriate point to return to the f. a. cup final tomorrow we will have f. a. cup pre views to come there is a few chaps who want to say something before they go
come on pompey
we're interrupting their breakfast they have been very patient a bacon sandwich for me it has to be bacon and egg it has got to have egg in there
just a sandwich
it seems careless clearly according to the aid agencies there is a massive amount that needs to be done in terms of the immediate emergency relief operation have been speaking to the un about it and their senior man was saying perhaps what the prime minister of burma was implying we need to concentrate not just on the relief effort but the building work the un are saying they are not just working on emergency relief they are looking at the next rice harvest which in days or so they need to get the seeds in to replant the delta otherwise burma is going to go hungry it could soon become a rice importer and for the poor farmers who live in the area this is a critical issue
it must be frustrating that still nearly two eax after two weeks after the cycloner they are be baiting what needs to be done and they are debating how many died
were you rowdy too noisy
not us we sunbathed all day
blame it all on young people if it was a group of adults before and a young person was walking through it would be the same but i doubt the adults would be asked to leave
let's speak to anthony baxter and claire claire you feel that a tiny minority are giving all teenagers a bad name
yeah i do i think well i can only speak from experience i'm from northern ireland and there is like five hundred thousand young people in northern ireland and the way it was put to me once was that last night it was reported on the news that five young people committed a crime but that still leaves four hundred forty nine thousand nine hundred ninety five that didn't people should be aware that it is a small minority and that it is not people shouldn't generalise all young people on the basis of a small number of people
i wonder about this though do do people not judge what they see and their own experiences it is all very well there is a habit of blaming the media for general presentation what most people do if they see someone walking down the street and see someone they make judgement about them if you
feel someone is dress indeed
claire do you not think that some teenagers revel in that image you might get group of lads who are nn of any innocent of any crime but they hang around in hoodies and like the feeling of power that they get from intimidating people teenagers are responsible for their own image
yeah undoubtedly that's a valid point and there are a small number of young people as well that would revel in that power as you say and think it fun to play up to the image they think they get but at the same time there are those that there is no basis for most of the discrimination against young people especially in shops l. mean young people on average have ten a week to spend and shops that treat us badly we won't shop
commissioner in northern ireland we did a survey and we found out that in the rest of society there is a perception of young people that they are going to shoplift shopkeepers are more thrown more prone to throwing young people out than adults because of that
people are struggling for their day to day expenses how do i find the money to do the food shopping had left on the money to pay the gas bill
the mechanisms for finding money these payday loans charging twenty five and everyone had pounds withdrawing cash and your credit card every one hundred these are hugely expensive
yes particularly payday loans m. twenty five pounds and every one hundred the borrower
certainly if you can access an overdraft talk to your bank about a personal loan you can get help and advice from an organisation like ourselves at the citizens advice bureau we can talk to about benefits there are numerous options that would be more wives in terms of managing your money than these two more worries more wise
i will show you in minute we are in little thetford in cambridgeshire villages were so desperate for a phone box in nineteen twenty nine click club together and bought one here is the modern day version they clubbed together and bought one b. t. wanted moved because it is not possible do we need call boxes and if they go do we care anyway
and they we do not need to lose anything else we have not that much we have lost in up
if you have not got mobile phone we have not got phone then in an emergency it is really useful to have one
it is not just villages some boxes darfur i am a single parent
i am unemployed l. l. cannot really afford marbles during the day it is cheaper for me have spent forty p. in a phone box mobiles
moral was relying on a mobile phones although we seem to hold the phone box in great affection we find little cold tea use them more novels
the village shop used to be there it has been knocked down but the have pub used to be this it the village pub b. t. says it costs around one thousand to maintain it not enough people are stepping inside people say even if they want to use it there cannot be cut it is out of water and it does not pick points they cannot because it is out of water and it does not take callings
we are expecting the news any second now we have got big questions for the top boss about whether he should of quit after terminal five more as we get it
trapped were children weren't they dan an investigation being launched now into why schools collapsed the way they did
in the last couple of minutes the british airways profit figures have been released we can go over to declan who is in the stock exchange for us this morning
point of terminal five was to change the bay b. a. operates and sweep away the spanish practises that jumped up in the different terminals and bring the airline into one terminal in heathrow with a new more efficient more modern way of working that's the management pressure behind the terminal five project but the airline has already admitted charlie that terminal five and the scenes the chaotic scenes that we saw on the opening day and the delays that we saw in the first few days that they are going to cost the airline millions of pounds but b. a.'s chief executive willie walsh said if they hadn't gone to terminal five when they did if they they waited until it was in a better shape that that would have cost them more
whether or not he should get
himself himself jumpinging from
britain to know you live beside a a noisy road or railway or airport but they have excluded so many things now know for instance football grounds we have yet to find one of those on the noise map
the government insists its noise map which takes in twenty three urban areas in england eighty thousand kilometres of roads five thousand kilometres t. v. railways and eighteen airports will be useful
this information isn't available that's why we have under taken this exercise and it will provide the local authorities to set up practical plans in which we can see noise levels reduce
a pack animal like these ones they are not well trained what's the next stage
we are going to have to slowly introduce them to carrying weights and put bags on them the little one is not ready to work because he is only three
and the village behind you
everyone is ecstatic about the donkeys arriving and they are looking forward to them starting
unusually this is not a novel idea
what do i think of her if anyone was in this position they would know what i think of her she give us endless hours of help endless boosting the up when i was down l. cannot describe what she done for us for me and my two sons
excellence says it takes long time for them to do their job it is a long process obviously people are getting in touch with you do try to get past this system
not doing for themselves there is an appeals process what is it you do
a number of in els a lot of them supportive of what you're doing and number of them question a number of e. mails one says these are not life enhancing drugs had he respond to that the fact that the national institute of clinical excellence have to ration these drugs
a lot of people do say that it seems unfair and tea use cancer patient as a cost cutting exercise yes cancer can be a terminal illness but they deserve the treatment as much as anybody else we're working through cancer research to treatment that will make this a manageable disease why on earth can we not access these we are only asking for what the rest of europe and the rest of the european union the western world has l. think it is important for patients to have hope obviously if they do not have this medication they will be referred to a hospice
one of the problems in the way is that you are in the lucky position you look at this very emotionally when you hear the story there we have just heard you cannot argue with that but the n. h. s. trusts have a difficult decision they do not make it on an emotional basis be they
absolutely not
de you take they like that
goodness me know
their oncologist that is their cancer specialist the patient i work with are ones where there and colleges has come to them and said you need this treatment i recommend in this book for you it is a clinical decision before i even get involved once i am involved they have their oncologist on board and i am very happy to take it on

good morning from the derwent dam here in derbyshire at ten thirty am the last flying lancaster in britain would sweep very low down this valley flying over the water at and come right that practice targets between the two towers year at the dam comment between tens of thousands of people are expected to flock here and see the event
it was the mission which used bouncing bombs to destroy huge dams in germany's industrial heartland this was just one of the many practice runs it took place ahead of what was probably the r. a. f. most memorable ride the mission was a success rate exactly sixty five years ago today the bombers which the plant in the the dam busters rate cut off from here in lincolnshire raid beforehand the crews were kicking football and playing cards then one hundred thirty three of them took to the air fifty three of them died their names are here and a special memorial the planes which to park in the raid were at lancaster this this is one of only two that flying lancaster planes today they will fly over the derwent dam used as the pack this target for the rape the bomb in were sat here in the nose of the aircraft the plane flew just sixty f. t. of the grant and he at to make a decision that went to release a single bomb this fact when to release
he was one of the most incredible pieces of flying skill you will ever see it was especially in a tight bali you have to get in there died down incredible
twenty years ago this was a tribute to the mission today those incredible flying skills will be acknowledged again
it is costing millions of pounds but the good thing of sponsoring a london marathon is it is all going to charity we already spent tens of millions on charity anyway this will have the advantage of getting involved would something which we think is a great sport it is the greatest that much it raised more money than any other event
drove down yesterday and there are a lot of flags and banners you get a real sense of civic pride when
how much did you pay for your
you are not going to the game you are watching it tomorrow
i'm going to a local pub with the kids and and watch it on the screen
the parade
yeah definitely
and their fans the team never emerged from the shadow of nineteen twenty seven until this season so say this is a big year for cardiff city is an understatement the club has almost gone out of business they are in the process of moving to this new home in the heart of the city and there is the matter of the f. a. cup final after being in the lower leagues for decades cardiff city hope the move will help propel the club forward the man behind the plan has had his share of football ups and downs but admits the club is good for business
song bluebirds flying high some of the senior players know this might be their last chance of glory
i got to the checkout and they refuse today sell it to me you said why they said you are with your fifteen year old daughter and she has no proof of i. d. and we don't sell to adults who have got children with them
have you been in that situation before and you have been able to
absolutely not a real real shock to me l. was really dumbfounded
have you previously done the same thing gone in bought alcohol and
a very common situation that you would go shopping with your children but can you see the point behind this
yes i can i don't think that shops should be compelled to sell anything to anybody l. don't think the b. b. c. should be compelled to put on a particular programme we life in a free society it is up to the shops whether they sell at any time to anybody anything as far as alcohol is concerned we have a juvenile unit we take inpatients down to fourteen now when you have had experience of looking after fourteen year olds who are heavily in trouble as a result of regular alcohol consumption their parents must of known about it
the common sense must have part to play
yes it does
the person at the till looking at dom fick with his dominic with his sixteen year old daughter
we must always err on the side of caution as far as children are concerned i agree with you about we live in
free society because you know freedom is part of being able to go into shop and purchase almost whatever you want to purchase and to do whatever you want to do with that purchase there is a civil liberty sort liberty sort of underlying air air area of this case
i think the supermarkets are being responsible they are saying we are going to have to leave it to the people on the till at the time to make the decision but we will always back them up if their decision is in the favour of the welfare of the child
i will tell you what we won't sell the stuff that makes it easier and people like dominic won't have this embarrassing situation
happening at supermarkets specifically was under the impression that more of the problem
was around corner shops is there
problem in the supermarkets
i don think there is a problem in the supermarkets than in the corner shop or at home it comes down to parental responsibility and here we have got dominic who doesn't look like the worst parent ever i would be happy to trust members of my family to your care but when we are looking at alcohol you get a fair number of teenage deaths directly related to alcohol consumption you get binge drinking moving on into continuous drinking you get children unconscious these are things that i see
where would you stop with this line the alcohol is taken into home homes have children in them would you you say you shouldn't have alcohol in the home because there are children in there and
at some point the adults are responsible
work to stop under eighteens of buying alcohol tesco's say it is not a blanket ban on parents accompanied by childrenment
not everybody is computer literate mobile phone literate people need the sort of things
they are taking everything away post offices shops garages everything is going we do not need to lose anything else
boxers could go in towns too this man says he relies on them
a i am a single parent unemployed and i cannot really afford mobile phones during the day it is a lot cheaper for me l. have spent four depends on the phone box and that about twenty minutes' conversation
morals now rely on a mobile phones although we seem to the phone box in great affection these days we find little call tea use them more of course
here it of that but they have already lost their village shop that was once the pub now they are worried about losing their call box it seems the people who use it most are teenagers who used it as a gathering post at night there is some greek graffiti here b. t. says
it cost around one thousand to maintain
phone box like this and it is simply not worth it if there is not a phone box within four hundred metres your local council can decide to keep it the parish council are going to fight to keep it
the context of the very disappointing opening to terminal five i spoke to the chairman and told him my view was it would be an appropriate for me to take bonus
was it your decision are were you told you're not getting it
national humiliation sumptuous they never mind the bonus you should have you pay docked
more than dan not say no you should stay in your job but you should learn the lessons what are the lessons
the reputation of british airways will be a recover and when
are believe we will recover the best way is to them a stake to people that terminal five is a fantastic terminal
i am pleased that we have had over two million passengers who had used terminal five i am pleased that our performance in terminal five is very solid we have already exceeded many of the target that we set for ourselves during the early stages of the operation there is clearly more that we will want to demonstrate to our customers you will see a very focused concentrate deptford by everybody at british airways to continue to deliver concentrated et concentrated effort
he told m. p.'s she took full responsibility howdahs keeping your job on full pay equal taking responsibility how does
i do not understand the difficulty people have with this what i did on twentieth march was i stood up one of its in front of everybody and admitted we got things wrong l. accept responsibility for getting things wrong but that means we have got to put them right the standing down were stepping aside does not help that my focus has been to fix the problems l. remain absolutely convinced we will do that we would demonstrate to everybody that terminal five can be a great success people should be prepared to stand up and admit things when they get them wrong l. have a big problem with people who were afraid to admit mistakes e. p. i. do not admit your mistakes you cannot learn from them l. can assure you we have learned an awful lot we're stronger as a result of this l. believe we will be better as a result of this l. believe we would demonstrate to everybody that we can deliver and will recover
it is costing millions of pounds but the good thing about sponsoring the london marathon is it is all going to charities we already spent tens of millions on charity anyway we had the advantage of getting involved with something which we think is a great sport it raises more money for charity than any other event in the world
mr. walsh told us that he accepted full responsibility for things that had gone wrong at terminal five but yet again he declined and resisted pressure for him to resign from his job at the head of the airline he says that the most important thing for him to do is to stay and learn the lessons put them into practice and then move on he says already terminal five has seen millions of
you don't have to be the brain of britain to know that you live beside a noisy road or a noisy railway or a noisy airport they have excluded so many things you know for instance football grounds we have yet to find one of
undertaken this huge exercise and it will provide the local authorities who work in partnership with government to set up practical plans in which we can see noise levels reduced
people in the village are really into the idea we have had a lot of support and people offering help
we have been here all morning with these two donkeys and they are not completely trained what are you going to do to get them into shape
hi wot udoin
it's like a different language i'm glad there was an interpretation on that video well joining us now is lucy van amerongen the author of the a to z. of teen talk and also marie clair from the plain english campaign good morning to you both presumably that comes naturally to you does it
skills or that actually you start writing in that way as well
c. u. l. eight e. r. on the
i think i would like to say that we are not all fuddy duddies at the plain english campaign we are not aghast that anyone would use creative language language is a developing thing after all and it should be organic but what we are concerned about is the fact that this will slip into the wrong domain
it and that is when you
it develop very bad habits because if
you use it once you use it twice it will slip into other usage and we have seen that within exam environments where people have inadvertently used abbreviated words wrong spellings when you are under pressure
imagine an exam situation can you honestly say you have never written any of those abbreviations or in fact had letters from friends or notes where they have started to let these words slip into their normal way of writing
when i revise are usually hear it out loud it's not usually a problem for me sometimes ride cars instead of the cars because
english teachers would be appalled if that starts to slip in
that is the greatest worry because that will then developed into the real concern then we will be asked and worried about the future where does that lead to unless you have a very stable core of language that is universally understood and accepted and it here to appeared
you are very well spoken you have a good use of language you have proved that you can do these two things there the problem is what is happening with other people isn't it
it can mean laugh out loud or lots of love
how much time you think you spend texting a day for i spend a lot of time texting to keep in touch with old friends
just to let people know what i'm doing in a normal hour how many text my you send it varies if someone texts you then you will have a text
i am guilty the founder of plain english campaign is a wonderful text of she communicates very quickly with texting but there is that need to be aware when you're doing it in the wrong place it's not about let's forget about texting altogether it's great fun anything that helps people communicate to be encouraged but in the right place
texting was only invented about ten years ago so if we introduced for words into texting say we don't want to get rid of texting if you introduce long words into which it will confuse people
a you got used to the language already that makes me feel so old coming up holding out for a hero neil oliver will be here to tell us how he is hoping to turn twenty first century boys into real men the web casting wonder returns sandy tom will be here to tell us how she is now dancing to the devils beat in a couple of hours' time a lancaster bomber will come sweeping down the derwent valley in derbyshire to mark the sixty fifth anniversary of the dambusters raid we will be looking back at some of the archives of what happened then and looking ahead to events today let's have a look at the weather there is a bit of cloud around in derbyshire and quite a lot of cloud around at the moment for some of us we will see some sunshine as well as cloud there is a lot of rain the net offers have a severe weather warning out for heavy rain yet to come into the south west of england it's going to be slow moving and thundery and will be with us for a large chunk of today you can see how another band of rain developed in the last twelve hours across wales the midlands and in through east anglia by nine am we will still have some rain across east anglia patchy and becoming more fragmented through the morning a bright start to the day the cloud is figure in the north east of england producing bits of drizzle in the north west it should brighten up this morning in scotland we should see some sunshine but where we have the cloud it could be fit enough for the odd shower a gorgeous start the day across northern ireland having said that across the north of northern ireland we could catch the odd shower during the day for wales it is a cloudy start with the rain into the south west of england we already have some showers they will continue through the course of this morning they are going to turn heavier for some they will be torrential we will have twenty five m. m. and an inch in some places they are going to be moving off into the direction of the isle of wight quite a cloudy day actually won a few are exposed to the north easterly breeze that breeze will be with us right through the weekend knocking the edge of the temperatures through the rest of the afternoon evening and overnight you can see the rain pushing into southern counties of england and wales it will be with us tomorrow as well there will be effected a cloud around with some bricks and some sunshine for the rest of us on sunday it is an improvement we will see some sunshine with variable amounts of cloud but the cloud could be thick enough here and there for the odd shower but nothing too significant once again we will still have the north easterly breeze that will take the edge of the temperatures which at best are going to be about fifteen degrees celsius when you compare this to last weekend and we were looking at a high to mid twenty celsius it's quite a significant drop if you live in the north of the country you are likely to have a touch of frost on sunday morning the last surviving pilot from the dambusters mission will return to the derbyshire reservoir where the air crews trained before dropping their bouncing bombs a lancaster bomber stages a special fly past of a day went down danny savage is there to see it what you can see there is the dam at the derwent reservoir the reason we're here this morning is because this was one of the practice targets used in the build up to the dam busters raid that was because this look so similar to the actual targets in germany later this morning a lancaster bomber will come sweeping down the valley here over the reservoir and through the towers flying at probably about one hundred feet it's all to mark the sixty fifth anniversary of the dam busters raid thousands of people are expected here to watch the spectacle it was the mission which used bouncing bombs to destroy huge dams in germany's industrial heartland this was just one of the many practice runs ahead of what is probably the most memorable raid the r. a. f. has ever done and against all the odds the mission was a success making six hundred seventeen squadron world famous exactly sixty five years ago today the bombers which took part in the dambusters rape took off from here at r. a. f. scampton in len fisher raid the crews were sitting around on the grass playing cards or kicking a football around then one hundred thirty three of them took to the air fifty three of them died on the mission their names are here on a special memorial in the shape of their targets that night and the planes which took part in the raid were lancasters this is one of only two still left blind and today it will fly over the day went down in derbyshire which was used as a practice target before the raid one of the most important jobs was that of the bomb bay mare who sat here in the nose of the aircraft but the plane flying at just sixty f. t. above the ground he had to make the decision of when to release the single bomb that each plane was carrying
you take a bigger aircraft like this and try to fly that down at sixty f. t. at night it was one of the most incredible pieces of flying skill you will ever see especially in a massively tied bali you can't have a run in at it you've got to get in there died down to sixty feet incredible
i felt it would be inappropriate in the context of the disappointing opening to terminal five so i spoke with the chairman a number of weeks ago and told him my view was that it would be inappropriate for me to take a bonus
i will find out for you
but there is a rumour there is
full english coming my way in five minutes i will keep you informed because i know it is the burning issue of the morning the other one i'm in carol's y. is the cafe over the greasy breakfast there is the subject of the f. a. cup who is going to win tomorrow
it will be an awful pomply will win one to zero
i'm liking your gloomy optimism
pompey will win two to zero
are you going
you finish your breakfast was it
it will be a tough game cardiff had a fantastic run are you watching on t. v. or are you going
i
to get to the final m. we get nothing out of the final unless we win it but if we win it there is a bonus of one million i don't think anybody is thinking in terms of the match in terms of one million they're thinking about trying to win the f. a. cup
the squad have recorded the mandatory cup final song blue birds flying high some of the players know this might be their last chance of glory
it is great that we have this opportunity and to go with a club like cardiff to the f. a. cup final and not going there just to make up the numbers
phone for the next ten minutes l.
kate before we talk about you and who you are and why you are doing what you do tell us about bruce
gosh when i see that it is so hard to watch bruce is an amazing man and he was diagnosed with cancer last year and his encologist said i want you to start the best treatment available that we know a drug for targeted therapy for kidney cancer he said i want you to go on to this this is going to give you the best chance of success so the oncologist contacted me and bruce contacted me and we began appealing for this treatment
he had been refused that treatment had he
well he had it had to go to a separate panel and yes it had come back as saying it was not cost effective and it hadn't been nice approved i took on his case and i did the appeal and we won and it was wonderful and bruce to see that as i i say it is hard to watch because i just get on and do it and to see the reaction is quite difficult to watch but it has been amazing to help bruce
i mean you got into this because your mum was in a similar position
might help but you couldn't get access to it
absolutely we had gone to see the specialist at christie's hospital who mentioned about this new drug he said this is what she needs and i said this is what she has got to have the encologist said they will never fund it and i said watch me and fortunatelily we did but after nine months she lived for another four and a half months mum died with hope not in fear you know the patients that aren't going to get the drugs will go through to palliative care they will be sent to a hospice there is no further treatment options for them l. think that trusts need to look at that when they are making decisions
of course they have absolutely extraordinarily difficult decisions to make that four and a half months you spent with your mum was obviously extremely precious but if you are in a situation where you have to make a financial decision between giving someone an extra four and a half months or putting that money into something which might extend someone else's life for four and a half years or provide some other treatment for them can you understand the difficulties in a system which has scarce resources the decisions those people have to make
yes or no is the no i don't think it is a case of one patient has a treatment before another patient doesn't i don't think it works like that what i think is that every patient should have the chance of the best treatment that their clinician wants for them and that's what i'm saying we are not talking about people looking on the internet and picking a drug and saying i want this can you help me i can't help people like that the people i can help are the people whose cancer specialist said you will benefit from this drug i want to help them get the drugs
we had an e. mail which was from someone who said that member of their family had wanted a certain drug hadn't got it on the n. h. s. and gone private to extend the life of their loved one and they got the drug the quality of their life diminished they spent lot of time vomiting and being ill and looking back they question the merits of extending the life if you like for the sake of it how much do you take that into account is it always good thing to extent a life that someone can lead
i have to go with the clinician i have no medical background the important thing is the individual patient has an oncologist making a decision on this the new drugs we're talking about actually far less toxic than standard chemotherapy people generally do tolerate them very well the people i now having a really good quality of life and are back at work they are the people i am targeting it is difficult to say how they would respond i will leave that with the commission it is not something i want to get involved in
boys and girls are brought up to do the same sort of things
i did not think we're forgetting it women are more assertive than they used to be that affects the way men behave
look at the beard on that manly man neil oliver is here now are you knocking their new man
i am not knocking anyone i feel foolish sitting here with long hair and make up talking about manly men at think the spotlight of attention is focused on very narrow band at the moment celebrity or fame is accorded to people who were pop stars or sportsmen i thought was worth reminding boys and then that there are also all the ways to be and all sorts of other lives to lead they can get inspiration it by looking to the past
you go through some stories people are familiar with some perhaps not so much the apollo thirteen mission
it would be well known to people who have seen the movie what was represented their in contrast to the film was that in reality the men in that situation behaved in very calm almost in boring way in the film when things started to go wrong there is a lot of smashing about raised voices almost panic what actually happened in that capsule was very calm very measured this was because of the men's training and to some extent what the author described as the right stuff there are men who just by birth by their very being are able to make the right decisions at the right time l. just feel that some of that attention wants to be focused on that kind of man is now entirely reserved for premiership footballers are pop stars
who are our current day hearers
that is a very good question heroes l. have always followed with huge interest so ran off fines otherwise was increasingly has become griffen this bass line increasingly he has become very famous and not saying that only men who are capable kate is sitting there and she is doing something that is heroic in a grand tradition but i feel that ran off fines was doing something invisible for a long time used to be because there was something in him that mackie was doing it
i am not knocking his achievements but he has spent his life exploring extraordinary places most people in normal lives do ordinary things they go shopping in those circumstances what is your analogy of a manly man the we behave
before her debut single became
worldwide hit it topped the charts worldwide hit it topped the charts in five and now she is back a latest felt that bracken made a single comes from a new album and talks about her fears for the environment we will speak to or in just a moment that has just quit let us just take quick look at a new song
it was amazing because i remember when i started out of his fourteen plane in a bar called the harbour bar every saturday night it was like my dream but it was always just a dream to get to that point when you finally get
while listing to the single it was bothering me who it reminded me off you probably hate this tonita to come is that good or bad
a lot of people remember when he broke onto the scene there was this story that you played two people on the internet you're playing in a basement that is how you took off people watch your own internet and said come on we want sandy tom out there we want to buy records was that all the case as mark was that the case chynna a absolutely
at the time my manager would walking in the morning he used to sleep on the matters in the kitchen floor it was living giggs the whole situation was funny we actually turned the basement into a studio recording when i'm in there now it is so weird because there are so many memories of all the stuff that has gone on
on before remember being in australia at the australian idol final and an irish guy called damien won it although that was his break he had done ten or fifteen years singh in a poll before that
did you ever enter competitions
i was always taking every opportunity given to me when i went to performing arts school added the urban choicer words and entered that online that was similar word casting thing l. was always taking every opportunity and it to me
he used a year almont their you say your new album addresses environmental concerns how were you dealing with that through music you that is one of the things the album deals with
i was right about what i see if something is popular and people are talking about it then we would write about r. b. c. the world's
resources and the planet is quite
is now fever figures have you got any thoughts on her
at it is really difficult nowadays because you go back thirty years and ray charles was a heroin addict jim morrison died from drugs jimi hendrix all these people rock'n'roll and drugs have always gone hand in hand the problem with her now is it is just so much publicised you just see the fact she is more she is really young and she has had a phenomenal amount of success maybe it's a little bit too much too young
did you get into partying
they are just taking everything away post offices shops and garages everything is going no we don need to lose anything don need to don't need to lose anything anything if
you haven't got phone but if you haven't in an emergency it is useful to have one
it is not just villages some boxes could go in towns too in in a nearby town this man said he relied on them
although we hold the phone box in great affection these days we find little call to use them here they have loss their shop many moons ago they lost their pub now they could lose their phone box in nineteen twenty nine the village clubbed together to raise the money for a phone box twenty nine b. t. say it costs one thousand to maintain a box like this and it is not profitable but there
is a general feeling people want
as she pir owe is a carousel never ending is a road to nowhere so she never knows if she is happy or broken hearted round and round she goes always back again with she started
beautiful voice
thank you
a new musical
it is a world premiere it has never never been done before
you worked with this team before the team behind les miserables was it written for you
high ranking german officer and she falls in love with a piano player who is younger than her played by the rather gorgeous rather dutiful jewel hann beautiful julian you saw him playing the piano he he plays the piano the company have been trying to find something that sucks about him but no we can't find it and we have alex hanson who is playing the german officer who is brilliant
when charlie said you have played in the musical stage in the west end and around the world for a start you don't look old enough enough to have been in the business for twenty years
i love you
it is sheer naked ambition that got you where you are
i would like to pick a different word than month monster l. l. think it is that thing that you have as a the arrogance of youth and it is an arrogance because i remember when i was doing a core chorus and i had no doubt in my mind that i was going to be in that show never had any doubt that i was going to become successful at what i did it was not an option to be anything
else when i was auditioning for
of roles that's the way to do it you just can't stay back back and hope that you are going to shine

we'd love to stay but we've got to nip out so er so yeah keep warm wrap up you'll be fine
good night
what bye
do you know what what this is brilliant isn't it
it's fantastic you are a legend i can't believe you managed to get his hotel room while he stayed in that cold van he is going to have the worst night of his life ever
oh i tell you what last night i was as snug as a bug in a rug
barney must have been freezing in that van he's got to have had the worst night's sleep ever what a fantastic super prank we played
it was brilliant cheers for that thanks for coming
great party tell me about it dude
thanks for coming ta ra mate absolute pleasure what a song karaoke king right there dave yeah yeah beautiful keep up the singing you'll be doing a great job hey guys you must have the most awesome time ever on tour you're hiding celebrities parties in the van
we never have parties like that that looked amazing it's freezing uncomfortable and more to the point you always snore
it's the one chance in my life i get a chance to have a party like that and look what happens i slept like a log hello mr. hotel manager
excuse me you forgot to pay your bill
let's have a look here i definitely didn't order that i didn't eat that i didn't drink that joel it's day two and after all yesterday's high risk hiding the guys are setting up another day of mum avoiding mayhem
yes but the second day is always much trickier so they're really going to have to be on the ball if they want to win more prizes i think mum might be getting a bit suspicious she smelt left over pie in my hair
we absolutely stink of pie
she could see pie in my hair but i said it was mud
she's a little bit suspicious she said i think there's something going on but i don't know what
all the pressure's on it sounds like mum could suss at any time you're going to have to be super stealthy today if you don't want to be busted
it's a good job kate'll keep mum busy filming big kidz
kate should have collected mum where's the binoculars i'll have a look brilliant right i'll go and have a look give them here no can't see a thing you'd better check if mum's gone no problemo joel be careful i didn't see kate or mum around the house but that doesn't mean they're not there oh no kate hasn't taken mum to big kidz yet they're just about to leave joel doesn't know he's going to walk right into them this is going to be a disaster are you ready to go yep
right
joel's out in the open he's going to be seen it's all over joel you have to hide what are you doing leave our camera man alone
right
oh crikey that was super quick moving joely boy just as mum and kate walk out the house joel grabs the camera from the camera man so he can hide behind it mum is only two metres away from joel that's less than the length of two baby cows how did she not see him that was so close the nerve he's actually staying there joel is actually filming mum driving away himself that is amazing incredible that has to be the closest near catch ever and i mean ever good work joely boy so that means mum's out for a while filming big kidz mum thinks all the cameras are filming a show called big kidz where she learns to be a big kid by being set a fake challenge so what's she doing today
oh what a feeling when you're dancing on the ceiling
mum's standing on someone's shoulders i think that's a little advanced
i can't believe you almost got us busted what do you say kids bad joel
i'm sorry anyway whilst i have a word
you can check out the rules for spaghetti western we've gone yankee doodle dandy for our next challenge our three wild west desperadoes are in a stand off against barney the three amigos have two minutes to sling spaghetti into barney's extra large sombrero what's more to distract barney i'll be squirting him with water if barney collects enough spaghetti to fill my sparkly stetson the kids will win these golden goodies yee hah all this wild west talk can make a cowboy curse listen when i tell you never approach a bull from the front a horse from behind or a fool from any direction
it don't take a genius to spot a goat among sheep
letting the cat out of the bag is a lot easier to sticking him in
you ain't doing no learning while your mouth's ajar
hey there boys let's play nicely positions please so then here's the deal they have to aim the spaghetti at barney's sombrero to win the prizes not a string of spaghetti has been lobbed and barney's already hit with a head full of water splash tastic the air is full of flying spaghetti not much seems to be getting in barney's sombrero come on kids there's only a minute and a half left get a move on nice shot emily let's see that again now that's a good scooping action right on to barney's bonce
oh that smells nice oh
and another shot of water to barney's head he's had a whole gob full come on move it move it barney is covered in saucy spaghetti but there's really not much in his hat come on kids there's less than a minute left you have to do better new tactics here come on guys you really have to sling that spaghetti faster if mama could see all the mess you're making in her back garden i wonder what she's up to well mum certainly has a style of her own back in the garden the kids are doing better they've pretty much thrown all their spaghetti over barney pick it up off the floor pick it up off each other i think you might just do this
five four three two one
that's it game over whoa we have a crash landing now that's a pasta disaster well done i did my best to soak you
you did i thought i'd give you a shower
right so that line is where you've got to get up to go on let's get it out there i don't think you're going to do this
yeah we are i don't think you're going to do this we are
you've done it what's that is that your phone it's not my phone
hello oh hi who's that
emms yeah hi it's mum
hello we're on our way back now
yeah we're fine yeah what are you up to nothing much
bye they're on their way was that who i think it is yeah mum mum's on her way she'll not be long
which means you need to tidy up and just get it sorted see you in the kitchen start tidying
quick and you'll win more prizes go go
there's spaghetti sauce all over the place mum's on her way back and we've got another challenge come on kids get it sorted all right then last challenge yes how did you find it
quite good but i have wet underwear now oh really fantastic
you stink of tomato sauce i've a shopping list for the next challenge cream pasta herbs want to know how you play
yeah watch this
being a trained chef barney and the kids want to treat mum and cook her a slap up feast but they haven't had time to buy the ingredients so barney's come up with a magical idea borrow the food from neighbours with mum on her way home they're going to have to be snappy about it our guys have three minutes to find these items we must borrow them form the neighbours but there is a slight problem mum is due back if she catches them they'll be totally properly busted but if our hiders can grab all the grub in those three little minutes they'll win this plate of sizzling goodies sizzle sizzle this is the starting point every time you get an item from your shopping list bring it back here to the kitchen that is essential we're going to watch you
to make sure you get all the stuff we've got a bag camera in there on emily so we can see how you're doing on there as well the thing is mum's on her way back so you need to be really really quiet
get yourself ready steady no running on the road that's important are you ready to go kids yeah three two one go go go go oh no what's this is that her in the car i can't believe it they've only just reached the first neighbour and mum's back home and she's driving right past them the mum's just turned up that was so close mum has to have seen barney where's the pasta in this cupboard
pasta they've picked up the pasta and it's back to the house
phew mum hasn't seen anything but she's in the living room being interviewed and the guys have to walk past her for our guys not to be seen it's going to need a shed load of skill and very quiet feet shh they're going to a different door oh no barney is so close to mum look at that i can hardly breathe myself potentially this could be game over a minute's gone but they still have to get the herbs and the cream be careful
we have to see that again just as barney crosses the door mum looks over she literally misses him by a nanosecond oh come on guys you need these ingredients and the clock is ticking barney what are you doing mum could turn around at any minute and see you no
we have to get some cream or some herbs do you have any herbs can we get some there's only a minute and a half
mum's on the move now i know that you know that but barney and the kids they don't know that brilliant that's another ingredient they have to sneak those herbs past mum
they're on the drive they're by the garage
oh no barney and the kids are going to run into the house with the herbs but mum's on the stairs they're sure to be busted and there's just over a minute left wow this is super nail biting stuff so we have the pasta we have the herbs just the cream to find now it's the last item one minute left oh no the lounge door's open and mum can see right into the hallway let's see that again barney is so close to mum if she turns around it could be game over
it's getting too much for joel he can't take it will this neighbour have the cream
let's hope so because there's only thirty seconds left on the clock yes they do that's all three items pasta herbs and cream now they've twenty seconds to get back to the kitchen i think they might do this where's mum going oh no mum is coming into the kitchen please somebody do something busted
hi mum hello how are you i'm fine

twenty programmes thousands of calls
familiars reunited because of your help
we had a woman phone the missing people's line her earliest memory is she can't remember when she went missing as result of the programme she thinks she is shahira our missing person
this is encouraging news how long will it be until we find out if it is her or not
the daughter phoned her on monday built up a bit of rapport we are building some trust at the moment this woman doesn't want to give us her location which is understandable but they are building up sort of dialogue between them
it looks like a lot of the pieces of the puzzle do fit really hope it's her make sure you keep us updated on that that would be fantastic news some fantastic results there proof that your calls really can reunite people teri is here from missing live we spoke to marcus rigby's mum he has been missing for fourteen years we have
dfrpblgts wolfer hampton tell us about the sightings she was interested in way mouth
i believe there is sights all over the place the police will look into all of them
she had all of those presents she has bought for him all of those years after such long period of time we would like some news obviously to know where he is but mainly to know he is safe and well we had roby smith we were talking calls on him he was originally from wolverhampton
there
they often had holidays there there she has put up posters and tried to get information but he could be anywhere
if you have any information on that please call missing live growing up as an only child she always long for brothers at seventy three joan found she has not one not two but three we have captured the moment they met for the first time first a night out with friends then a bag of chips for the walk home that was twelve years ago his family are still waiting for him to come back although the isle of wight is popular with holiday maker less than one hundred thirty thousand people live here the nettles family moved to the island in nineteen ninety to a small resort of gurnard a mile west of cowes damien is an extra vert and popular he settles in quickly
is he a big silly boy all arms legs and flailing life and soul of party always made us laugh silly sense of humour very sweet very sweet natured as a teenager damien has a lot of interests me and damien became close friends when we went to high school we used to play a lot of music together that was something we did on a regular basis he played the guitar and he sang he
me and my brother and alan were going to watch sol films and have a couple of beers and a laugh after a couple of hours we had been there me and damien wanted to have a chat about the music so we decided to go down to the local shop and have couple of ciders and a walk through town we went up through cowes up towards park at which point the weather was so bad i had enough l. drank what i had to drink and as damien was as close to his as to mine he decided to go home was going to go off home to my house and in the morning we were going to meet up again
damien's mum phoned up my house and said can i speak to damien it was like damien is not here
later on missing live damien is reported missing and police discover that c. c. t. v. has recorded him in the town centre on the night he disappears we will return to the story of damien later in the programme if you think you know anything about his disappearance please get in touch now remember andrew gosden is he the fourteen year old who ran away from his home in doncaster last september eighteen months ago there have been lot of potential sights of andrew since the day he left hi family are waiting for him to come home and his mum will be joining us later fifty four year old raymond scott has been missing from stand more in middlesex since november two thousand one ray had been doing some plastering work at his brother's house but never arrived back the next day is he five seven with medium building and hazel coloured eyes he has ray tattooed on his left hand if you have any idea where he is please contact missing people he is the eldest of five brothers and sisters they know he sleeps rough but when they don't hear from him for over a week they know something is seriously wrong how do you find a man with no job is and no fixed address humberside police have been investigating the days peerance of a street sleeper from hull for over fifteen months thirty three year old andrew bunby has not been seen since he up centre in january last year l. am investigating the days peerance of andrew bunby l. believe he was seen here towards the end of january two thousand seven what information do you have about him being seen here
he was last seen on friday two thousand four hundred twenty sixth of january he
very upset very weepy and tearful it was making sure he was safe and looked after and making sure he was comfortable and send him off and give him another appointment at a later stage for the monday morning we i faeled to attend which he failed to attend
it's not known why he was distressed that day but no one sees him again after he leaves the medical centre it was good sighting it's someone who knows him that worked in the medical profession and is certain of the
date and time it happened it's
good point for us to start our inquiries we have a that sighting and it's definite place in time andrew comes from a large family in hull
there is me and five brother including andrew he is the eldest out of us all he is thirty four now l. am twenty two it's quite a big gap but we was quite close
after his marriage collapses in his twenty andrew starts to develop a drink problem
there was times like most men they like to go off for a pint maybe once or twice he would have one too many pints to me this is how it started on rollest coaster only it didn't happen overnight it took a while
by two thousand five andrew is losing control of his life
i had a lot of contact with the brothers and they were telling me that andrew seemed to be drinking more they didn't know why they said it's not andy he is out there and mixing with
missing the investigation into his disappearance has now been going on for nine months d. c. jason co oper is heading to a soup kitchen that andrew is known to have used
andy was i would say for a period of six months was a regular visitor once or twice week average guy nice man but obviously he was hurting from whatever reason things in the past he was in pain he was struggling
they are like a community
do you recall having seen him since the twenty sixth of january
not at all no
jason cooper has been making regular visits to areas in the city used by street sleepers
this is the area under the bridge we knew that andrew frequented on a regular basis a few month ago it was a popular point where the homeless people would camp out and you would find a number of tents up the there braisiers where they were lighting fire to keep themselves work even cooking food underthere to some people it was
it is hard for everybody i think we just hope one day he will knock on the door
i get up in the morning and my first thoughts is will we have andrew today will he come knocking
the agony is not knowing that is
joining me now is humberside police detective jason cooper who with he saw investigating andrew's case what we know from andrew is he is of no fix abode investigating someone with that status that must be difficult for you is that something have you had a lot of
not in my experience it isn't it throws challenges we wouldn't
normally have with sun who has
in hull itself in the city centre which may have moved the homeless people along with the regeneration so i guess that's another problem
that's right the homeless people in hull city centre tend to frequent the same familiar places since andrew disappeared last year the geography of the city centre has changed and there are now places that they frequent they didn't year ago conversely
they've have been very helpful they've been difficult to track down which has been a major challenge we've used the local pcos neighbourhood watch scheme and wardens
the main thing we can see there yes he is homeless at the moment but he's very much loved by his family and we hope he can get back in contact and let know he's safe and well
yes it's very sad that his father passed away let's hope he does get back in touch
gorm mountain rescue team extend the search beyond the forest
we didn't have a lot of information to go on because in this instance the police didn't really have any idea if the guy was actually going for a walk into the mountains or indeed just out for a drive and had broken down there was very little information that we could use to start the search
r. a. f. helicopters are called out for two days search and rescue teams cover hundreds of miles on foot
we cleared the mountainside above the forest and then we checked the base of all the cags but there was no sign
steve's medical condition means he can't walk far so on day three the emergency services start to search the nearby loch
r. a. f. helicopters bring in sophisticated sonar equipment to search the bottom of the loch sensors that can detect submerged body are lowered into the water but after twelve hours of pain staking work nothing has been found it's now week since steve disappeared from home everyone searching for him is mystified
i've been doing mountain rescue for thirteen years in all that timior not finding someone but after three i don't remember not finding someone but after three days we exhausted that area and we couldn't come up with any ideas of where he might be it was like the guy had
problems with his relationship with clare he had seemed really happy it's all out of character he used to tell me things if there were anything bothering him he used to talk to me about it we just want some answers he'll come back one day i'm sure he will
i miss him teasing me telling me how to work my computer going for a beer with him on sunday afternoon going across to the club and playing cards i miss that
if you have any information at all about stephen please do call
missing people t. ry we've had a
few calls
we have about twenty calls on stephen which is encouraging with a couple of those sightings people have sighted someone who's five foot four we want to remind people that stephen is six foot two so bear that in mind he has some distinct twenty six tattoos as well
a lot of your work is identifieding missing people someone has been found in kent last week
we've had five calls on him with possible
time you've you've literally got this is the list of where they all are in central london they appear to be around tube stations
tube stations tottenham court road oxford street areas we know he liked and was familiar with
also interestingly as well because you've been going through them all sightings there seem to have been in brighton
we've had a cluster in brighton between the end of march and early may which will again is possible it's an hour on the train from london it's easy to flit back and for the
seen them get on the phone go straight to somebody in authority
he's a very gifted boy he's not a typical teenager he's very articulate and gentle he was reading philosophy when he was thirteen clearly he has been raised in a faith household and i think he was at the point of considering life the universe everything he was reading a variety of things he's not a typical teenager that you might spot in an amusement arcade that's
would you say to them i i would just encourage them even if they ring on the runaway helpline it's anonymous just to know that he's alive and he's safe and he's living the life that he has chosen for himself right now would just be such a comfort as opposed to knowing nothing about it
that is the thing he may even be watching this programme with something he doesn't want to tell you you just want to know he's safe don't you
you make that point that whatever the reason is it doesn't matter
it doesn't matter there's nothing that we can't sort out or discuss you've left without giving us a chance to know that you even had an issue
thank you very much for your time i know he'll be fifteen in july let's hope he's back by then if you have any information about andrew's whereabouts call missing people andrew if you're watching you can call the runaway helpline all her life joan had wished for one thing a brother now seventy three she's found just what she's looking for and more in nineteen thirty five joan willis is adopted she grows up thinking she's an only child but now at the age of seventy three she's just found out she's got three brothers and a centre today she's about to meet them for the first time
having grown up as an only child she admits she's
after seventy three years of not knowing about a whole different side of her family they're here her sister maureen and her brothers bob and george but for lorna the jigsaw isn't complete her third brother can't make it here today for joan and her brothers and sister this is just the first step of many oh what a lovely hug hello everybody thanks for joining us good morning joan you're going to do the introductions for me tell me who everybody is
this is george my brother and john the eldest brother and this is bob
morning to you all george we start with you what was
yeah and joan you had always wanted brothers did you you had no idea
none at all l. l. was over the moon over the moon fantastic
tell us about that moment when you first met
they were all in tears i am getting all emotional we were overwhelmed with meeting each other
after all of this time after all of this time we didn't even know
tell us how you got in contact
it was my daughter in law who found out about it all she contacted my cousin my second cousins and it went on to the other brothers that is how it went on lorna did all the work to be honest
spitting image of my mum
hear stuff about her
very good a lot more to find out we haven't done all of our talking yet but
we have plenty of time now
know have you a lot to catch up on what kind of things are you doing
every week i go down there once a week and we go all over the place
nursery different places
have you got similar interests as well you have a sister as well
yes maureen
how is that fine
haven't seen much of her really the odd glimpse of her
what do you think the future holds for you
we will just get on with it they are all coming to my house on the twenty ninth of june twenty fifth of us all coming we will have big party
you were a bit of a tomorrow boy i understand tom boy i understand
so they say
lip reading expert for analysis the police hope it will shed light on what happens next while white waiting for the results officers tried to trace other customers in the shop that night
some of the people in the chip shop were identified and inquiries can continuing now and i am still anxious to identify all of the people in the chip shop on that evening he left there within about five minutes or so the suggestion from a witness is he went towards the gurnard direction there is quite a common route used by people who live in the area along the sea front towards gurnard
it's less than two miles from this part of cowes and damien's house there were two routes home along the sea front or through the town but which one had he taken
a lot of people assume he walked along the sea wall and fell in damien had a good healthy respect for the sea he was a fisherman it was a windy wet rainy horrible cold night i don't think for a minute that damien would have walked along the sea route
posters make contact and you can obviously contact the missing persons or contact the local police
thap is an interesting point
before i started this i was
magnet for some of the missing people a lot of people find themselves drun to the capital
underfunded area what do with doe
to help there people could make
lord adonisation
paul and i have make a donation
paul and i have been make working together for many years support people is critical in this the police can not do it aloin there are people who will talk to alone there are people who will talk to paul's people but not to us it's about being the relationship us working together effectively that needs to be the story
if i could add to that what is also critically important is that missing is a massive social issue which is almost invisible sometimes because it's so widespread we are working very closely with government now we really hope that this programme is going to make government think more about supporting the charity specially when times are difficult when funds get diverted we do need the government to help us

don't climb out of windows when no one's around you could fall down to the ground
hello like most people we're very interested in the property market
i'm always on the lookout for a bargain
how do you get one one way is to visit your local property auction
there are thousands of property auctions available every year so you really are spoilt for choice
let's take a look at what made our buyers part with their cash today
what this end of terrace in reading has in height it lacks in width you couldn't even get a single bed in here let alone a wardrobe
i spend an afternoon in leafy nottingham amongst these gorgeous houses but unfortunately i'm here to see this
and in kent there's a development opportunity to build from scratch if you really want to cash in how about two
all these properties have been sold at auction and we'll find out who bought them and what they paid for them when they went under the hammer
my recommendations for this property would be to use the third bedroom as a study room or dressing room or take the bathroom upstairs
what sort of price can you get for a two bedroom house in reading
if i was to place this property on to the market in good decorative order i believe we could place it on at around the region of one hundred ninety to one hundred ninety five the property could be rented out between eight hundred twenty five to eight hundred fifty per calendar month
so quite healthy returns on both resale and rental my worry though is how healthy the structure of the house is super location with adaptable accommodation and that very low guide price western road certainly has a lot going for it let's see who went for it at the auction
long term well i want to retire cos i'm getting close to the age and hopefully it's something to do after i give up work
so this is a bit of a pension plan for you really sort of yeah well this might be one of many pension plans as surinda has had a number of different careers
i started off with british aerospace after i finished my studies and i worked there for about three and a half years i took some time off i went to india that's where i met my wife and we came back and got married and i got another job which was to do with medical equipment and then i got as far as i could and i just wanted to you know do something on my own and i ended up buying a post office locally here where i spent about twelve years doing that but there is no real social life as far as everybody else was concerned i own the business but i think it turned out the other way the business owned me so eventually i gave up and got a job with a local supermarket company so i could just go there come out and forget about it and i've got a little bit of my own life back really
do you feel happier now that you can spend quality time with your kids and your wife absolutely yeah so all is well in your household at the moment yeah for the time being and you've just gone off and bought an auction property yeah surinda clearly likes taking on new challenges and with this house he may have more than he was expecting but he's confident that his previous work experiences will stand him in good stead with this refurbishment so how will you use your business knowledge on this job
well luckily i was here locally and i've made a lot of friends while i was at the post office so i've come to know a lot of people who can help me with this project electricians plumbers and builders so that will come in handy
so the only thing that worries me is having not got the survey done before the auction and i went outside and checked the exterior wall are there any problems that you know about structurally
not at the moment i did see the cracks the structural engineer is coming tomorrow to do a survey
is that because the mortgage company requires that
yes is that worrying you that the mortgage company have asked you for that well yes and no it's a good thing that it's come up now and i'm able to do something about it rather than finding out later on and having more expenditure about it so i can deal with it if i find out at a good time
what if you can't mortgage this property would that throw a spanner in the works
ah it would a little bit yes but then you learn by your mistakes hopefully i'll have to be more careful next time
let's hope it doesn't come to that surinda will have a stressful wait before he knows where he stands with a house like this i'd always recommend a survey before you buy it might seem a big expense when you might not get it on the day but it could save you a small fortune in the long run are you going to let it out or do it up and sell it on
the first thing i'm going to do is just to redress it do the painting and hopefully do the kitchen and the bathroom and depending on the market at the time my idea is to sell it but if the market doesn't dictate that then i might rent it out
what sort of budget have you got
i would say approximately about three thousand is my limit and we should be able to manage within that cos it's mostly the bathroom and the kitchen and the general paintwork
three thousand is a pretty small amount having those friends in the trade will help but he's going to have to do a lot himself to stay on budget so what does your wife think of this she's all for it yes
she's prompted me on to do this so we're both in it together she's quite happy about it
so you're going to be having late nights working in your supermarket long days renovating your house are you prepared for this hard work hopefully i should get some help
it's more like a family project i've got a son and daughter and my wife hopefully we can all chip in and do something with it
with his electronic healthcare post office and supermarket background let's hope that surinda can add property developer to his diverse work portfolio surinda gave up a business that was running him more than he was running it the father of three has made a brave and really inspirational career change here and i wish him well i'm sure he can put those business skills to good use on this project we'll find out how it all goes later on in the programme
this is ruddington a desirable and sought after village five miles south of nottingham ruddington is small but it has three museums and several grand houses originally built for wealthy industrialists from nottingham this is manor park a lovely private leafy road close to the village centre it's lined with gorgeous edwardian houses just the sort of thing i love looking around unfortunately i'm here to see this it's a concrete carbuncle but it's the thing that's up for auction it's on at a guide price of a cool one million for a site that amounts to twenty two acres in total so does it get any better when you get inside er no it's got about as much character as a chest freezer it is actually a residential care home purpose built so i suppose you can expect this it's utilitarian and functional square rooms but you have got a lot of space but in terms of character it certainly hasn't got any of that orchard house amalgamated with another care home so all the residents were moved leaving behind an eerie maze of corridors and empty bedrooms it's hard to believe that this place only closed a few months ago it wouldn't meet current regulations for this kind of use the rooms are too small they don't have en suite facilities so your options would be to completely refurbish it and use it for something else or my preferred option knock it down the care home was built in the grounds of a former manor house and even now the gardens make up a substantial part of the site the nicest thing about the property is the land that it sits on it's absolutely gorgeous and totally out of character with the building there's no planning permission at the moment for changing this place the planners have said you can only build something on the same footprint as this building so you couldn't build on this land which actually is a bit of a relief however i'm sure they would be supportive of anything cos it's got to be better than that but before anyone rushes in with the bulldozers they should have done their research this entire plot is within a conservation area building included unattractive though it may be you can't simply knock it down without first involving conservationists and the local council and if that wasn't enough it's also classed as an archaeological alert site this means work could be halted indefinitely if anything of historical interest is unearthed during the excavations all in all this isn't going to be an easy or cheap site to develop so what does a local property expert make of this uncared for care home has there been a lot of pre auction interest
we've had quite a lot of interest both from private nursing homes wanting to refurbish the property and also from developers there is a big demand for houses in ruddington at the moment and there is quite a lot of new development popping up in and around the area
with that one million guide price what would be the value of anything built here
you know me i'm normally a big fan of keeping and restoring old buildings but in this case i think you'll be doing the world a favour by taking a very big hammer to this place it's disgusting and i'm sure you'd get the support of the planning authorities to knock it down so who's ready to take it on let's find out what happened when it went to the auction
the man who paid one point two three million for that concrete carbuncle of a care home is charlie but he didn't buy it for himself he works as a land buyer for a large property development company which specialises in new builds i met up with charlie back at orchard house charlie nice to meet you nice to meet you congratulations thanks i still feel a bit strange when things sell for over one million at auction yeah it's very exciting so how did it feel to spend over a million quid on this place
i get a great buzz out of buying at auction it's very enjoyable when it comes off but we bought at a figure that we're happy at so i was very excited
so what happened when you walked in here well we're not too worried about the property itself
we liked the plot we thought it was a bit of an oasis in ruddington and a very nice site we have the possibility of putting houses on it there's a potential for putting apartments and potential for a new care home and the number that we paid fits in on all of those opportunities so we can move in whichever direction the planners will allow
let me take you back to the auction you're not spending your money but your head's on the block if you mess it up and i have a blank cheque you do yes blank chequebook one cheque how does that feel lose it at the petrol station on the way there
they do joke about me not disappearing when i leave the office wow yes barbados here we come
tempting but charlie obviously didn't run off with that blank cheque the company have been exploring the options available to them for developing the plot so what have we got here
and what are you proposing to do there
well this is just one option basically we've got two mansion buildings which will reflect the area and the houses in the locality
but just in case two mansion blocks are not to the planners' liking there's a back up plan
another theme of apartments just one block containing the same number of apartments
and that's
the basement car parking you can see and three levels with a parapet wall and a hidden fourth level so that from the front you'd only see the roof
how many apartments do you think you might be able to get on here
if we went down that route maximum fourteen
what's your idea for what these apartment will be like
we'd be looking at large three bed apartments premium fit out so they'd be expensive
can you give me an idea of the onward sale price of those
it hasn't been set in stone yet but rough ball park in terms of how much the project's going to cost you
i would imagine that development will be in the range of one point five million to two million
yeah and what about timescales for all this how long's a piece of string planning might take six months and then development from then on depending on what we do would probably take eight months right
well good luck at the next auction with your blank chequebook and good luck with the plans thanks well this was always going to be a big project for somebody to take on so it's not surprising that it's a big commercial developer who has bought it what are they going to do with this fairly dismal building find out later in the show
in kent there's an auction lot with great potential plenty of space and if you play your cards right it could make lots of money so what's the catch
did the buyers of this former care home near nottingham take my advice my preferred option knock it down
long term well i want to retire cos i'm getting close to the age and hopefully it's something to do after i give up work
so this is a bit of a pension plan for you really sort of yeah so three months later did his pension plan look magnificent or had it bitten the dust from the outside at least there are promising signs there's fresh paintwork and that shabby front garden area's looking tidier and much more presentable the inside has been modernised with a combination of old and new fittings and fixtures and the garden area's also been given a new lease of life
we looked at the garden and it was not looking very nice at all there were a lot of weeds so we took all the slabs off and we put some shingle on there just to sort of brighten it up and we put some pots with flowers and a little bird table as well which has made it look a lot nicer and it's brightened up the whole place and i'm quite happy with it
so the place looks finished and ready to go but is the new decoration just papering over those cracks
when i had the survey done that reassured me that there was nothing structurally wrong or there was nothing dangerous so that was the main thing if i had got the survey done previously it would have been better but you learn
a lot of the cracks were old and not an indication that there'd been recent movement they weren't unusual for properties in the area and particularly an end of terrace so surinda could carry on decorating in the knowledge that it wasn't going to crack up before his eyes
preparation was the main thing and it took a long time and i was driving along one day and i saw this poster saying handyman and i rang the guy up and i said can i have an estimate so we met and he had a friend who helps him with most of the decoration and everything and his name's rick so he's done most of the painting for me
just the whole complete house really from top to bottom from decorating to re tiling the kitchen for him and just making sure the property looks absolutely fine
he's done a very good job and i'm very pleased with him i think we've become good friends since then
nice guy nice guy we've actually made like a friendship through the thing the house so yeah it's really good
surinda also had some help from family and friends but it sounds like finding rick was a relief surinda still has a full time job and though it's mostly night work finding the time to do up a house is tough but paying someone to do the work obviously affects the budget
i'm very pleased with the way it turned out if it carries on like that then hopefully i can retire into this cos i really enjoy this and really i own the business this time because i don't have to get up at any specific time i don't have to work one day if i don't want to so it's a nice business to be in from that point of view
so surinda feels he's now got more control of his life and ricky's keen to do the same
it's just something i've always wanted to do since i was young and i will do that now i've gone through the experience with surinda of how he's done his property and obviously move it on as well so great
so ricky and surinda may have more properties ahead but for now what's the future for their current project
next is to sell this property and move on to the next one as quickly as i can
that might be the plan but for that to happen surinda will need to see some profit here he bought the house for one hundred sixty eight thousand at auction and has spent three thousand on it so far but what do two local estate agents think has he made enough money to move on to another project
my first impression of the property good clean and tidy very presentable
the area the property's in is good it's quiet but it's very very close to the town centre and local transport links as well
outside space is important to first time buyers a small courtyard garden is normally enough for them
the roads are very narrow and it is just on road parking so if it were somebody with more than one car it may make it difficult for them
has surinda's western avenue house shot up in value from the total of one hundred seventy one thousand he's spent on it
two hundred fifteen sounds good well i was hoping for about one hundred ninety five myself so if that's the case yeah that's very good i'm quite pleased
maybe two hundred fifteen thousand is a little optimistic but at the very least surinda should make about a twenty thousand profit even with deductions that's a pretty decent return for a first time so does surinda intend to carry on with more developing
it's my retirement plan and hopefully if i can get it going if i can get three properties a year or something that will do me quite nicely
gravesend's developing vastly you've got the canal basin where there is huge development going on ebbsfleet valley international station is ten minutes away the prices of properties will increase because you'll be in london quickly
with twenty five thousand new houses and flats being built over the next few years in and around this area of kent things look very good indeed for this plot let's see who feels the same way at auction
go on one more
no don't want it all right sixty one then i've got
and the winning bidder is steve a local builder and this is his first property development venture he remembers the garages from his childhood and thinks they used to house an old ice cream van but flights of nostalgia aside things have got serious for steve he's raised the money for buying the garages by remortgaging the house he shares with his partner so steve did you enjoy the auction process
it was a bit nerve wracking i started bidding towards the end and it went just over the asking price which was really good news
we was prepared to go higher than that i don't know if i should tell you how much i want to know seventy
you were going to go to seventy seventy yeah for a pair of old garages i know seventy we thought was realistic
but got them for sixty one in the end
what are you going to do here with these old garages
plan is um two semi detached cottages that's plan a or failing that a detached property possibly four bedrooms
it definitely lends itself to some sort of dwelling i mean these totally look out of place exactly
i think it's the last plot to be developed in the area and we've picked it up so really fortunate
so what's your knowledge of building property
been in the building game really all my life started off when i was a kid labouring on sites and stuff and that's what i've done over the years picked it up as i went along
and for how many years have you actually been building i'm going to show me age now about twenty five years
and i just thought it's about time i done something for myself now i want to earn the money out of it and so here we are
so how well do you know this area and this site in particular
i know the area fairly well i was born in gravesend
hanging around for services stuff like that planning permission etc all takes time yeah we've taken that into account and hopefully start building in sort of two months possibly ten weeks' time
probably about one hundred thousand for the whole build the single dwelling possibly seventy to eighty around that figure
both of these options will give him a decent profit one problem with building next to long established houses is that neighbours can often be upset by the noise dust and general disturbance that a building site creates but steve has already begun discussions with the neighbours to make sure everything goes as smoothly as possible
he'll agree to my plans and i know also he's got some plans of his own to build a double storey extension as well so we've combined the same architect to hopefully alleviate some of these problems and possibly build a party wall etc
so you can all be happy that's the plan and you can all work well together i know you've got some light sketches can we go and have a look at them sure let's have a look this is all quite exciting it is so what are these just sketches
they're just a rough sketch basically of plan a that i was telling you about the two cottages so this is what it's gonna look like from the outside hopefully
three floors yep three storeys there yeah
there's the off road parking there lounge diner stairs to the side as opposed to in the middle yeah
and you go up to the third floor
yep hopefully third floor possibly two bedrooms and some storage area or en suite something like that basically this is just a rough sketch that i can take to the local planning authority and just give them my rough ideas then we'll source the architect to do the detailed plans and personally i think that you know a good deal starts with good plans detailed plans and obviously we'll work from those until the job's complete
steve is currently planning to try and put a three storey house on the garage site this might be problematic because none of the nearby properties go any higher than a second floor still it's a risk that steve is prepared to take does this really excite you
it does yeah yeah it does it excites me and also it's scary in the same vein if we don't gain planning permission and for some reason we can't build i've paid sixty grand for two garages as long as the planning goes through everyone will be happy
steve has risked a lot but with developments springing up in the area and property in high demand he's willing to bet his house on this venture and he quite literally has done that the cautious amongst you will shudder while the reckless will just smile at the thought join us later in the show to see if it was worth the risk
well there has been plenty of time for our buyers to have started work on their properties
yes but have they done any work or have they been delayed by problems
time is money so have they made money or lost out
shall we go back and see what's been happening let's do it
it's been one year to the week since i met charlie a land buyer for a large property development company he'd placed the winning bid of one point two three million for this old residential care home the plan was to build twelve to fourteen luxury apartments on the land where the care home stood a year's a long time in business and when i tried to meet charlie i discovered he's since moved on to other projects so there's a new kid in town development surveyor julian
i've taken over off charlie who bought the site off savills at auction for twelve million so i've now sort of stepped in and they're bringing the project forward slightly
while the project has a new face unfortunately the old care home remains untouched so what's happened to the plans to build luxury apartments
initially it was our thought to go down the residential route as we picked up the site for a good price which gave us a number of options high end residential or to go with existing use it was formerly a local authority nursing home we've now decided to work with relevant interests down the c. two use
that's a care home to you and me but this one will be a little different there is still demand for care homes in this area but as they are a development they want to create desirable properties and make as much profit as possible so they've come up with an idea which suits everyone
it's still going along the lines of high end residential but the difference is we're providing an assisted living product which means we provide the property and then we'll work with the provider to provide the healthcare side of it and it enables over fifty fives to buy their property as normal and the assisted element is if they want or so wish to have the care it's there on call they still buy their bricks and mortar with the care element on top
with the decision made the company work closely with the planners to ensure the new build would meet the needs of prospective residents and also fit in with the surroundings
as you can see here from our architect's drawings we've gone for a modern contemporary building with features that fit in similar to the building next door to the property which softens it up it doesn't have so much of an impact in the area the front elevation here you come in it's the front access again the building it's not dominating above the surrounding buildings the existing buildings as you can see from this one here it fits in quite well with the existing surroundings which just enhances the assisted living product
once built there would be around forty high spec apartments with care facilities on site the company can hand the whole development over to the care provider once it's finished
if we were to build open market residential units here then we'd have to sell each unit unit by unit and the market's not fantastic so we've got more risk and more exposure the interest which we've had to date and to work the planning ticket with is from an assisted living provider which means that provider will take the whole forty units off us in one lot
it all sounds great but what does it mean in terms of cost and profit i invited a local estate agent to come and give us an opinion on the plans and their value once completed
i think the plans are really good they certainly work well with the environment and there's a market with assisted accommodation
so with demand for this type of housing strong how much would it cost to own one of these apartments with on site care facilities
you don't need to be a mathematician to know that is a lot but let me do the maths for you forty apartments at the lower price of one hundred eighty thousand would mean a total sale price of about seven point two million and a top figure of about eight point eight million it's too early to tell how much the finished development will be sold for but as they paid just one point two three million for the land and managed to get planning approval i think we can safely say it's been an excellent investment
charlie did a fantastic job of purchasing this site for the company it gives us a number of opportunities and hopefully we've found the right one
once this building is complete it'll be sold en masse to the assisted care home provider who will then sell the individual units it'll be at least another seven months before they're all finished but for julian and his employers it's all turned out rather well
no i just thought what a dive
but talking of dives he might be diving into the deep end with this because it's his first property developing enterprise
and i just thought it's about time i sort of done something for myself i want to earn the money out of it and so here we are
if he gets planning approval he's hoping to build two semi detached cottages or one four bedroom house but i have to say i thought he was very unrealistic about the time it takes to get planning permission
hopefully start building in sort of two months possibly ten weeks' time
two months to get planning permission if he achieves that i'll eat my handbag so let's find out how he got on we're returning a full six months later by which time according to steve's estimates the property should be built well there's good news and bad news the bad news is that the site has not been developed but the good news is that my handbag is safe everything looks pretty much the same so what's gone wrong
since you was last here not a great deal's happened to be honest as regards to the plot but planning permission's been going through the necessary channels the council actually refused planning permission for the semi detached properties we was proposing there's obviously been a lot of red tape slightly disappointed obviously we're trying to maximise our potential so the two properties would have been a greater profit margin
steve's hopes may have been slightly dampened but he's still optimistic
i think we'll more than likely go for a single dwelling possibly three or four bedroomed property it will be more in keeping with the local area and hopefully it will go down that route me and the architect are getting on great and just trying to get the plans passed really just be happy to get started on the work
there's a one bedroom and a two bedroom flat here's the main entrance for the ground floor flat living room dining room kitchen leading to the garden it'll be a shared garden there stairs for the two bedroom flat lounge diner kitchen same layout really as downstairs apart from two bedrooms in the loft space again parking was an issue but we've managed to hopefully please the council with that but as i say failing this we will go for a single three or four bed dwelling
as steve even has a plan c. in the pipeline it's very clear that he's determined to succeed he and has partner raised the sixty one thousand to buy the site by remortgaging their existing home loan so far they've been paying extra interest for the last six months still resourceful steve did manage to claw back some of the money
well luckily enough we've managed to rent each garage out since last time this one's been used for storage and there's a vehicle in that one so that's bringing in eighty a month something to go towards the cost
although behind with the schedule how has the budget fared
steve still has a long way to go before he finally gets approval from the local council so did he make a mistake buying the site without any planning permission whatsoever or might the garages still be a worthwhile investment the best people to ask are two local agents
the flats are a very good size from what i've seen on the plans both the one bedroom and the two bedroom would be an ideal dwelling for a single or a couple
he would benefit from building flats on this plot of land but he'll probably get planning permission more for a house as there are houses and no other flats here
this is a very busy road you've got parking on both sides of this road it is very tough to get vehicles down so it is pretty essential to have off road parking
they have got plans for off road parking and the layout of the properties do look very good
planning on this plot is very very likely we're in a residential area as we look around we can see houses that are around us and i'm pretty confident that he will get planning if it's not for flats then for one residential dwelling
so he could just about make his money back on the flats but what about those houses
i'm really pleased to be honest about the prices of flats it's more than i've been quoted so far i was quoted sort of one hundred fifteen for a single and one hundred twenty five for the two bed so that's more than i expected to be honest that's great and on the price of the four bedroom house i wasn't sure to be honest with this particular area of the total cost of the three or four bed detached property but two hundred twenty five upwards to two hundred fifty that's really good news

i wondered whether this would be a profitable exercise given the mammoth's docile nature and their inability to find any given address
order your pizza late delivery and you get one free
frank and pilbeam set off fireworks to celebrate the pizza parlour
well the marmots seems to like it pilbeam
the orders were coming in quickly and olive was in charge of dispatching the delivery mammoths
what did you say olive nothing
just that you were getting so good at making delicious pizzas
watch this woo woo yeah
nice one
another order mammoth pizza you've been waiting how long yeuch oh it's sticky and disgusting no not you sir i'm sure you're neither sticky nor disgusting of course you'll get a free pizza when it shows up goodbye olive
it's that mammoth delivery it's going to ruin us
it's not their fault auntie brenda mammoths can do amazing things but perhaps expecting speedy pizza deliveries is just a bit too much
but i've got posters all over the island promising pizzas delivered within thirty minutes oh
don't panic auntie brenda i'm sure there's something we can do
how are we going to speed up a ten tonne mammoth
i don't know but there must be a way
olive stepped into the night air to collect her thoughts and that was when i arrived having waited over three hours in vain for my pizza to be delivered i was starving
the rocket is the simplest kind of heat engine it burns fuel in this combustion chamber the hot gases produced expand greatly and rush from the open end driving the rocket up into the air this rocket engine has an igniter at the top a channel for the hot expanded gases the solid fuel is packed between the channel and the casing whilst the nozzle at the bottom can be swivelled in order to steer it ah having found some bits to work with olive asked frank and pilbeam to make a rocket powered vehicle
i wouldn't want to be near this when it goes off
the two rockets were mounted onto a wagon and troy was test pilot
why do i have to do it because mammoths can't drive oh right ted i better get strapped in then what in the world are you lot playing at we've got pizzas to deliver
don't worry auntie brenda this is the answer to all our problems
start the engines
w. h. a. a a a i hope he knows how to stop that thing
no there's no stopping a rocket like that there isn't oh no they just go and go until their fuel runs out really
uh how much fuel did you two put in there anyway
it wasn't that much was it pilbeam
i don't think it would get to the moon w. h. a. a a a a i do miss my boy hello hello this is a collect call from dodo island dodo island troy ah troy get back here this instant we've got pizzas to deliver but mum
the chief here says he really loves your pizza he might ask for more
oh all right then but make sure you get his money his was the first pizza to be delivered in less than thirty minutes
perhaps if i ate some pizza i'd think a bit more clearly
well go and have one but before you do have you got any ideas
ah
you can't have it until you've paid for it
but i've waited over three hours for this anyway i'm famished so i'll have a second one and pay for it uh uh uh
oh all right then
ah that was brilliant after i had eaten eight brenda gave me another free one what's this our new controllable rocket driven pizza delivery wagon
start her up
there she goes no she doesn't
what the islanders had failed to do was include oxygen or air to enable the fuel to burn take this spacecraft it has a fuel tank and an oxidiser tank these are fed into this combustion chamber where they are ignited thus propelling the craft through the emission from this nozzle
well that wasn't much good then
wasn't a bad try except for the lack of oxygen
what's that smell it's delicious
the fan's blowing it over here
dad great idea why can't we use a fan to blow air into our engine
invincible olive was right a turbo fanned jet engine which powers big airliners uses a large rotating fan to drive air into these compressors burning kerosene in the combustion chamber heats the air which expands and rushes towards the exhaust turning a turbine to drive the compressors and the fan more air is sucked around the outside cooling the engine and then joining the heated air so a great volume of air speeds from the engine driving the aircraft forwards with tremendous force and the advantage of a jet engine over a rocket is it doesn't need to carry its own rocket supply thus saving weight the disadvantage is it won't work in space as it has no atmosphere
time to start the jet engines
they had better work this time hot pizza coming up whoa ppt pilbeam look what you've done i didn't do anything it was that newfangled engine oh engines is that all you can think of at a time like this personally i was always quite happy with mammoth power
let's let off these fireworks perhaps they'll cheer brenda up
the last rocket was defective and ended up sailing through the marmots' burrows the expanding gases of the burning fuel exerted an upward force on the poor little marmots what we had observed the marmots doing was the key to the underlying principle of the petrol engine or internal combustion engine here a series of pistons are attached to a single crankshaft another liquid fuel petrol is mixed with air sprayed into the cylinder and compressed by the piston the air slash petrol mixture is ignited by a spark and the resulting explosion pushes the piston down the exhaust is cleared as the piston rises again and the cycle repeats itself over and over again the petrol engine the islanders built was fast and powerful and also very suited to the stop and start nature of pizza delivery
all right troy you only have a few minutes to deliver these pizzas do you think you can do it no problem mum pass them to the mammoth and we'll take care of it the mammoth i thought we got rid of them because they're too slow but our advert promises free mammoth delivery people are expecting it yes we just can't do without them all right as long as we keep the thirty minute pizza promise i don't mind what you do
at least we got one thing right the dear old mammoth
yeah he's a fantastic frisbee flinger
there you go boy launch pizza he hasn't missed a target yet
and not only that he looks kind of cool back there don't you think
cool totally frigid man
i decided to make a time capsule box
to show my children what i was like as a child
this is my box and i put all the things all the things that i like
um the teacher done it um of me i think it's quite good
these are another favourite of mine they're dream dolls that my mother gave me at christmas cos i used to have bad dreams but now i don't have any bad dreams cos i tell these every night what dream i want to have
this is my favourite doll her name is sammy she's six years old she goes to school she's very good at maths
he's doing a move called a freeze where the idea is to cross your legs over in the air while balancing on one hand um it's a very hard move and i doubt i'll ever do it
a strange instrument it's called a nose flute and you play it like this and it's very hard to operate it's my hobby
welcome to to buy or not to buy today we're in the east midlands
helping a nurse and a pilot relocate to the country
and we'll be indulging in no puns or dodgy wordplay regarding their jobs
kristian you medically can't do that
roger that the property market can be a turbulent place full of cancellations and delays so before leaving the departure lounge why not check in with us
i've warned you about this what puns wordplay kristian really they're too much my wordplay is excess baggage exactly really what he should have said is we will be twitching our property noses to find for our buyers three lovely properties that tick all their requirement boxes
absolutely and once they've seen them they get to choose their favourite so they can try before they fly
buy try before they buy
let me have one pun try before they buy andrew and lucy tilling and daughter gracie have lived at this house in leicestershire for twelve months
they're an all action couple andrew is a long haul airline pilot and when he's not flying he tends to his classic racing motorbike
lucy is a sister in leicester's accident and emergency ward one of the busiest in the country so she's used to trauma but can she cope with a life changing property move
or meeting with kristian and me
hello now lucy and andy when people go house hunting and walk into a house they sometimes get a feeling or a sign that it's right that this is the house to buy so when you bought this lovely pad what was the feeling what was the sign a big mess on the floor beg your pardon
lucy went into labour in this house
you went into labour in this house on a viewing i was pushing
we thought we've got to buy this house it's a lovely house
but you want to get rid of it yes why
downsizing why we want to take money out of this house and put it into another property
well first timer doing it with a couple of mates who are builders and stuff i think we're going to have a go we're not looking for that though
what are we looking for this time for you guys you're spending the money lucy's got to have somewhere to live as well what are we getting we are looking for somewhere in a community
something really old or really new
rooms how many upstairs do you need downstairs
at least three bedrooms one that we can make into a study slash spare bedroom for when people stop
a sociable kitchen somewhere i can put a sofa
kitchen diner everyone wants a kitchen diner metrosexuals
metrosexual you really are a pair of metrosexuals we are
and garage is an issue as well
we've talked about the house what about the surroundings
i want to be in a village so i can walk out the door walk to the shops sorry did you want to talk now no no i want to walk out the door and say hi to somebody
a cow anybody just hello sheep
ed let's move this on by talking about money please money
how much money are we playing with you want some money for your little business
we didn't pinpoint where you'd like to live so give us names let's have some names please
you start hemington
newtown linford
lockington donington diseworth kegworth breaston croft long eaton rothley
whitwick
oh whitwick coalville um cropston
amazingly they are still listing off still going it's like they do this in their spare time
rothley mountsorrel mountsorrel quorn
kristian they are so metrosexual it's frightening they want a breakfast diner how dare they
mountsorrel mountsorrel quorn
still going still going i can't retain any of the village names they were talking about i remember pratt's bottom and badger's mount but that has nothing to do with this
that was a dream you had really yeah really where shall i go
donington
castle donington castle donington i'll go there then
and you're going to go to
they've stopped that leaves you in a sticky situation doesn't it i'm just going to follow you can i follow you please no
all right i suppose you'd better had castle donington is an attractive village in south derbyshire which comes with some quirky added extras
and the monsters of rock festival property wise in this neck of the woods you'll pay from about one hundred ten thousand for a terraced property around one hundred forty five thousand for a three bedroom semi and anything up to one million for a period town house or a leafy detached number
well in shrewsbury there's this semi detached cottage with three bedrooms kitchen diner and a pretty garden and look at the location we're talking open fields not bad for two hundred forty nine thousand nine hundred ninety five
meanwhile back in castle donington time to crack on with the property search and see what we can find
i'm chomping at the bit i've come to the estate agent's caroline here is on the phone can't serve me time is of the essence
we're in castle donington trying to get an idea of the area monsters of rock seems a strange thing to happen in castle donington have you ever been no what do you imagine it's going to be like absolutely superb
castle donington's got a lovely rural feel to it good schools restaurants
castle donington could be described as a type of metal is it heavy metal as a place or is it a lighter metal what kind of metal are we talking
lighter metal i think how light
they are all lovely properties i just think they feel slightly generic
david cassidy what about him was he at the monsters of rock no
hello hello i've been tipped off by a lovely old lady about a place called ruddington have you got any three bedroom houses there you have
now to get us in the theme some in flight nibbles there you go
i was just thinking i need two bowls of crisps
voila tell the good people what you've done what i've gone with is this glorious lovely property here dating back to the eighteen hundreds loads of accommodation spread over three floors it doesn't get much better than this and and in a great village location i say no more edward what have you got
i have this fantastic looking pamphlet here c. h. ching have a look inside see if you can notice a theme look at that one see what i've done
uh huh oh
old new old new modern interesting contrast to your one
one thing we were in complete agreement about was the joint choice the wild card you all right there
just remembering when we found it and how we felt
special times it was a bit like this a little bit the reason why it was worth hugging about it's a glorious property it's got the charm the character so kristian shall we start the viewings at property number one and the first house is my choice and oh how i love exceeding expectations
you did disappoint me on my birthday i'll ignore that
let's do a check kitchen diner for lucy check a garage for andrew check three bedrooms no let's make that four check this is a beautiful period home in a prime village location
let's come down to earth kristian and see what they make of it
andy and lucy i'd like to thank you for flying digby air we are cruising at about six feet high if you look to my left hand side we are about to land at my choice property number one it's a first class choice the reason why because it's got four bedrooms
four bedrooms hallelujah
let's hear it for the boy
not bad is it praise for kristian praise him
it's got all the charm and character that you were wanting first impressions are
i like it good girl
nice you like it magnificent
a lovely village location that kristian's given you apart from this it's not a main road
it's a little village road a village road
go in there you'll find emergency exits there there and there do you think i did that well
i thought you did it superbly marvellous i'll get the canapes
the the question is is this going to be a passport to a new life or are they just embarking to a debacle
he just makes these up all the time he's a fountain of puns i can't help it can't help it
ooh oh wow
we got a wow straight off not bad is it
ha we got quite a small room straight off we're downsizing have we forgotten that straight off
i do like the fireplace this is more cosy then our living room at the minute
it's nice to sit and have a nice fire going on a cup of tea
this house has got all the original period features they are after it's got the quirkiness the charm the look
yes it's cosy beams as well oh i like the beams i didn't notice those
beams everyone loves original beams find me the man who doesn't love an original beam and i'll find you a liar
well there we go breakfast kitchen look at that fantastic oh
praise being poured on you
i am stroking the cat can you stroke me i deserve it thank you i'm doing well i'll go so far as to give you a little hug now we're being metrosexual
you wouldn't get any more sociable than this yes i do like the kitchen where would i put my sofa
it's not the world's largest kitchen diner but you've got enough room to do that
what's that you're corking the wine
as long as you've got that movement you're fine
andrew what's that a cellar i'm not going down there
oh yeah wow
if you plastered and decked this out you could have this as a little man annexe
a man annexe a man annexe andy looks like a man who wants a man annexe what would he do in there i don't know a pilot alone in a man annexe
steep stairs steep stairs
even though we're downsizing they're getting three four if you are including the agh argh
this has got loads of character this is nice
i like the stairs a bit steep
after a few vodkas we might struggle
it bit me if i do that you don't go biting me do you
if you'd have done it for half an hour i'd have been driven to it let's give it a go let's see ow
so this is the first i'm really confused this would be gracie's room bedroom number one gracie's room loads of storage space up there
it's all about wardrobe space isn't it every house sale seventy per cent of it i reckon is based on wardrobe space
if you want to sell your house and can't stuff wardrobes everywhere
study perfect so this is slightly smaller than that one this is smaller this would be better for gracie yes on the back the study you could put in there
bathroom i can't get my bearings it's got alleyways everywhere what do you reckon small
ed this is just like you small but functional
we always said we'd like a corner bath i wonder if you could fit that in here
if they want a corner bath let them have it
i guess it must be nice it's got sloping floors feel like i'm on a fairground ride
that's character that's what you get when a building is really old it hunches a bit you get a bit of oomph oomph here and there
do you think it feels cold in here i think it could be cold in here
that radiator's only the size of
i think it's quite romantic if your bedroom upstairs is a little bit chilly you know what you have to do what
the thing is heat is supposed to rise are we on the top floor now
it depends how well insulated the roof is
ed i was just about to get close and whisper insulation to you that's all i was going to say
oh a spare room wow that's nice
they've got that real knack of nice decor the people who own this
yeah this is like the wallpaper in the kitchen modern but old it's lovely
a wallpaper showpiece wall
ah modern but old yes that's a bit oxymoronic that's a big word
spell it i don't think kristian could spell that
how dare he
how well he knows you how dare he
look at the bulldog oh yeah or is it ed
no this is ed ed's the one that looks like a poodle
kristian they've left the house let's see what they think
lucy you like the house which is good the most important thing i thought on your shopping list was the area
yes all about enjoying the village location yes friendly
you said you'd like a village where you could walk out of your door and wave to people i did so here we are in castle donington let's see what happens
andy andy come with me look at this this is your actual man annexe
this is what i like lucy was trying to stick you in the cellar she was but i don't think i'll get my bike down there it's not going to work
so brilliant you've got a garage negative problem though shared access yes so you don't actually own this and for tinkering with the bike out here not so good i've got a solution come what me
hello ladies are you all right lovely to see you good stuff
so this is your space you can do a bit of work if it was raining on the bike don't worry it keeps going
now this area notice what could happen here
time for another conversation you're going to try can you just tell me to sorry oh go on you might have some charm but you haven't got all the charm
he was running away from you i'm not that scary kristian
out here i'm tinkering in my own space i'm revving no one can complain because it's my area no absolutely
it's not just your area because you're joined by us now
it's time for guess the price it is a very tense part of the programme you could fall out by the end of this
that wouldn't be hard would it no
you are pitted head to head andy i'm going to start with lucy because she's a lady lucy how much come on
she's stolen mine
oh come on recalculate give us a price
so you've gone higher interesting i tell you what you're wrong but you're also still miles out the price of this house
oh yes i have delivered a really good price property
that's good four bedrooms garage
think of the spare money you'd have to spend yeah i'm liking that you could write the word man annexe in gold on the side there
edward this is a property show not a history programme what about the house
we're on a building site demonstration given
they are building at the moment these things don't just leap up they don't build themselves
so what i've got you is a building site cum safe haven in ruddington what do you think
looks nice very similar to the other property but modern yeah yeah
see what we've done there the same property but modern i like it young old treat it like your first date hold hands skip through there if you want just enjoy it
like it's our first date why not you gave birth in your first house
you know what you've done you've knocked it out the old ball park that's the one they love it don't they yeah
ooh new oh lovely what do you think
it's warm in here anyway
it's warm
they love it ah like angels singing
there is that but i'm sure that is probably the downstairs bathroom
yes
get your wallet out and it makes exactly the same noise
i take it this is the living room it is not as big as i was hoping
you had a focal point in the other one you walked in and then there was that fireplace not as many things in it character
where would you put the telly in the living room whereabouts in the living room
corner probably and the sofa near to the telly
where do you put your telly i think we just have to not have a telly then we will have to talk to each other instead
kitchen diner that's nice
there they are they're in the kitchen diner
are you going to keep being weird no
i'm a bit speechless about this house that's because it's a new house no it's not it is it's because it's a new house no
this house is very stylish they have taken all the glamour of olde england and made it modern
there you go ah surprise
what you've got here is reception number two yes upstairs where else would you want it
i like this how do feel about your living room on the second floor it's different odd but why not if you want go and make us a cup of tea where have you got to go now
there might be another kitchen next door let's have a look
you've got an advert break now between your programmes she goes cup of tea please you've got what a minute and a half
but surely if you use that downstairs as the living room then this could be another bedroom
if i was in tea mode watching television i'd watch t. v. downstairs next to the kitchen
i do that's nice nice shower
just have a go in there see how it feels just have a go
they are trying out the shower now thank you come on pour it out pour in out you have made me a pretend cup of tea
they are confused by how many bedrooms they have seen because the layout messes with your mind
and when i say little i mean little a study
could you call that a study
i don't know or a boxroom
what i have given them is a study for their needs i've not taken space away from where it needs to be in bedrooms in two lounges
i like the bathroom i like that
did you hear that did you hear what lucy said
how do you feel about no shower you've got a shower downstairs in the en suite
so you don't really need one up here
but then your guests haven't got one have they we have got two showers at the minute we have smelly guests
you've obviously stayed with them
so our guests could have like their own floor essentially with a bedroom and bathroom and the living room
the guests with their own floor could your house have promised that i doubt it very much i severely doubt it did your house have an en suite i doubt it very much it is nice
no i like it it's a possibility i like the estate i like the area
i still think the problem with this house and the reason why they're not falling truly madly and deeply is that it is topsy turvy replanning time it's not true
kristian took you to castle donington that's the home of the monsters of rock it is the home of high speed motorbike racing and you have got an airport next to you yes everything here is just lovely
quaint quiet beautiful there's a knitters museum here
you've got playing fields heritage centre they have got quite literally everything it is nice
it is quaint it is villagey
also this is never ending fun there's a sundial here look at this stand on the month we are in and look at where your shadow is look at your watch
wow
let's tackle the big issue the layout this is the mind bending moment we have a lounge downstairs and up here we have a lounge opposite the bedroom
let us not be fettered by what has gone before let's think in the liberal manner downstairs what about using that lounge as a dining room that is probably the best option for it then where the dining table is in the kitchen you could put a sofa there so can you see what is happening so sofa in there you can relax have a glass of wine a chinwag then dining in the dining room up here still remains the lounge how happy are you about being this close from lounging to sleeping
i quite like that because i like to kip on the sofa i can roll out of the living room into the bedroom
you could almost in one roll go from sofa to bed
and the eskimo said no that is just frost on my moustache
i make that about eight seconds from up there down to here not bad
what have you been up to
we got lost
a lovely huge house
integrated
i reckon it is more like two hundred twenty nine thousand nine hundred fifty
wrong i think top of the range house brand new mod cons i'm going to go to two hundred forty nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine i know the price
andy you have done so well you are only out by twenty thousand this time
well done getting closer never mind
i'm not going to make a surveyor
lucy you're out by forty nine quid the price is two hundred forty nine thousand nine hundred fifty what do you think
i think he can fly planes but he can't guess prices
yeah speechless
let's go to the wild card
it's got a dishwasher
oh come on
integrated
the wild card a chance to give full rein to the senses to set free one's property muse and let it soar
yes it is a nice house
but it is perched on a hill up a secluded path can't you just feel the romance
it's just off the main road in castle donington and we both reckon they'll love it but there is one little thing missing
here we are at the wild card which is our joint choice the reason why it is wild is that it is all about location the mysterious unorthodox location there we have a main road there you slip up this little pathway here that weaves its way through the shrubbery the oak trees and all the paraphernalia that you find in gardens there we see the hairdo of the house leaping out behind the bushes otherwise known as a roof it is a nineteenth century weaver's cottage oh hidden for your eyes only what do you think
from what i can see it looks interesting
nice roof nice hairdo
i like all the shrubbery
you have got a brussels sprout patch down there who doesn't want to live within fifty metres of brussels sprouts
me there's one thing it doesn't have
what doesn't it have neighbours it doesn't have neighbours what's that but you can't reach over the garden fence and say morning you can shout at them
there's a community feel about it it's tightknit tightknit
get in there and tell us what you think go for it i like that she is doing all the punning you can't pull the wool over her eyes can you right headphones on as soon as you can
that is great oh it's the kitchen you walk straight into the kitchen
that's fantastic
oh look great
they are in rapture
wow that is fantastic
that is fantastic how great is that so this is your dining area it's a kitchen diner officially they are separate rooms microwave it is really nifty with the storage
nifty storage hello not just ordinary storage nifty storage i'm going to pray
i pray that this house is less than two hundred fifty grand me too
um ooh i can't remember
look at the floor did you notice that's original floor that is
look at all the oh the marks
lifting up the rug there having a peek what lies beneath
this is a beautiful house it's really quirky with all the storage things quirky this time
quirky is gorge this is amazing never has storage got so much praise
it's got a propeller on there look open fire oh let's put an offer in i like it
oh look this is a home isn't it
lucy has said the magic words it's not just a house kristian what is it
it's a home they've gone over budget here they must have done
they're pushing us aren't they do you think they're just teasing us yeah
they're convinced this house is too expensive and this is the study i guess
oh wow
do i know this man
you must know this man you could knock the price down if you do
if you look at the statistics pilots can only legally live in houses that other pilots have lived in is that a secret law it's an interesting fact a very unknown fact
we need a rope to get up here you need to be an abseiler
those stairs bear resemblance to going up the steep face of everest
this must be the master bedroom it's got that nice wallpaper in
it's modern chic
you've got modern chic in a cottagey place
how have we we've you and you
no not me and the views that is beautiful ah she's looking out of the windows now she's now made it hers amazing
a crooked table is that the carpenter or is that the floor a crooked table in a crooked house
it's olde worlde style carpentry that's the charm you don't want anything too perfect look i've got you
oh look at this
now the bathroom is the piece de resistance it's amazing
jacuzzi bath room for two oh yeah that's important
imagine a pilot with a jacuzzi bath i bet andy on his christmas cards way back when it would've been him in a jacuzzi with a glass of champagne with his hat on
double shower as well we'd never have to bath separately again
what's special about that shower it's big no double size no what's special about the shower come on multiple jets
its the barbie room every house should have one fitted storage
storage that's just something they've made
i thought they were going to talk more about storage they got my hopes up
that's double glazed
so the only window that's not double glazed is the master bedroom that's really odd
you see the noise of the road is only a slight hum
that's nice nice view
it was quite evident while you were walking around this house something happened you fell in love here
yeah
so what is it if you can explain about this house that is making your heart go boom boom
we just walked in and it felt like home you know what this house says to me christmas
now that's interesting because i think if people go into a house and start thinking christmas or i'll put my christmas tree there that's a huge psychological thing that you want to spend one of the most important days of the year in that property you've been speculating the house may be more than your budget
you're teasing us aren't you are we
andy have you spotted the flaw in the wild card property
yeah the lack of garage space for the bikes
what do you think this might be plans it is and we currently are stood in your garage imagine that look at this the people here they've got planning permission and they've designed this lovely looking thing fancy looking garage reclaimed bricks reclaimed rosemary clay tiles i'd want to live in the garage
we're here talking about garages they're in there discussing where you would place your christmas tree
quite near the window so the glittery baubles sparkle in the daylight hello hello
hello so it's the final one
you like it it's the wild card property will you like it when you know the price andy you've done so badly today it's somewhat embarrassing so i am going to let you start
i think you're teasing us i really do so i'm going to go what did you say
two hundred fifty eight thousand nine hundred fifty
i'm going to go two hundred fifty eight thousand nine hundred fifty five you can't do that
she has
go on then
i don't think that's too bad it'd depend how much it'll cost to build this garage that's the key
people will move a lot on price
think about that and the fact you've seen three great properties now here i have a laptop on this laptop are images of all those three properties i want you to take this away and think long and hard argue it out about which one you'd like to test drive we'll find out later on here's that disappear we'll see you later
cheers see you later on
that was quite interesting it really was interesting debate about to be had
whilst they rummage through the images
here's a quick recap for you at home so we've locked them on the horns of a dilemma and it all started with my choice property one the village location the three storey period home the kitchen diner
the man and its garage not a bad start and way under budget but then came the modern world of property two three storeys of contemporary lifestyle you choose where you want your lounge or be greedy and have two and the price of modernity
and then the wild card a cottage set fair on a donington hill
just the two floors but it had lucy using the h. word home and planning her christmas decorations
but it's got no garage for andy and it's over their budget whatever are they going to do
there we go property number one
here's the living room it's quite small isn't it it wasn't that big i like the fireplace kitchen did like that i like the kitchen diner and the fireplace and things
needed a lot of work though but there was room to manoeuvre in the price must be the master bedroom next yeah did like that room nice and big bendy floors lot of character to it
property number two modern good contrast with the first one as well the dining room cum living room cum whatever master bedroom a bit small but it's got an en suite to it as well
then the main family bathroom i did like that family bathroom property three yes
very nice property
yeah very villagey
beautiful kitchen with a dining room
i think i've got my mind made up
have you yes i know which one i want to test drive
so andy and lucy after much head scratching you have decided to test drive the wild card good choice now snuggle up close great before we send you in there to do your test drive treat it as your own we've actually had the property surveyor give this house a thorough going over but we'd stress before you buy your own house you get your own structural survey carried out in the first instance he's got some interesting things to tell us that roof
you spotted it andy you said looks a bit wobbly bit bendy the surveyor has been in there he said it looks a bit wobbly and bendy went inside cos he was a bit cleverer than us he looked at the ceiling and said they're all flat it hasn't impacted on the ceilings it looks in keeping with the proper ty everyone loves a bendy roof don't they
meanwhile extra information here because as the house was built on a hill the hill goes up the house is built into it so you get the rear of the house the soil is this level your internal floors are this level which means you could get damp ingress there is sign of a damp course it might need updating so get someone to check it on the plus points he loved the extension he started skipping when he saw it for him that's a very exciting thing to see started skipping extraordinary sight that's all i can say get in there tell us what you think it's your test drive enjoy it
legally you've got half an hour's rights to everything in there
go on go go go
gone they've gone
there are many ways to test drive a property but frankly i always like to see the young uns involved
gracie's in but andy has annexed himself he's sampling the local lanes on his super duper souped up racing bike
well with him out of harm's way time for lucy to enter the bosom of the community brace yourself castle donington
there's lots of nice people in castle donington oh really oh that's good
still very villagey very villagey
oh everybody likes to know everybody else
oh yes very villagey aren't we supposed to be test driving a house
oh look a scene of domestic bliss oh oh a nappy change it was going so well
i wouldn't want someone tampering with my undergarments at all times of day would you
i'll get back to you on that but things are looking up
one two three
after a good sorting out and here i speak from personal experience there's nothing quite like a carton of yoghurt
andy and lucy you chose the wild card property we're now sat around potentially your new kitchen table maybe or not what do you reckon
really like it really like it it's nice
really like it the ambience is still appealing christmassy all year round
hopefully there'll be room for negotiation in the price
excellent i hope you get it because i think it suits you i mean that from in there
thank you for finding it for us
yes his heart we weren't sure you had one you've been a gorgeous couple a real laugh and if you do buy this we'll expect an invite to the house warming
absolutely you'd be very welcome thanks very much let's go before i cry chocks away
ah bye bye
we've done very well again but let's not do what we always do and have a cappuccino and a bowl full of ice cream let's go and have a sauna and think about property
get in touch and we'll try and find you your lovely dream home your trousers you're not even wearing trousers
you can work it out if you just learn about the way things work if you really wanna know how it can ride or bump and jump glide and slide take a little look inside the way things work and watch the thingamabob that turns the knob that makes the jigger jig that turns the thingamajig that pulls the trigger that makes the digger dig if you really wanna know how it can fly without a wing or string to tie with you find the same rules apply with the way things work tie him up here frank don't want him wandering around
there's plenty of rope so he can get to the water trough
good cos nothing's worse than a dehydrated mammoth anyway if he frees himself he won't go very far
how much do you bet
come on you two we haven't got all day
brenda had agreed to help run the mammoth island awning factory whilst its owner was on vacation unfortunately everything was behind schedule and there were lots of awnings to deliver so she asked frank and pilbeam to help
haven't you two forgotten something
what's that the paperwork you need to sign before you deliver anything
can't see why we have to fill in so many forms to deliver one awning they call that modernisation the elimination of inefficiency
more like elimination of forests with all the trees they cut down to make all that paper
where's our mammoth gone he's run away
this can't be true
well i don't want to believe it
i thought mammoths couldn't fly
i understand
when the wind blew the mammoth flew
the strong gust of wind had turned the mammoth and the awning into a kite a kite can only fly when there is enough wind and its string holds it so it deflects the wind downwards the wind provides the force for the flight it exerts a reaction that balances the pull of the string and the weight of the kite to support the kite in the air
what have you two been doing to that poor mammoth
it's all wet and miserable
we were trying to deliver an awning and the mammoth took off then came down again splash
the mammoth had a bit of an accident
and it got all wet that's why it's soggy and warped next time make sure you wrap it up good and tight so as to keep it dry
brenda without realising it had come up with a great idea if the awning were wrapped up too tight it would become curved so the exterior would look rather like this shape which we call an aerofoil when flying the air passing above the wing has further to travel than the air passing beneath this lowers the air pressure above the wing which forces it upwards the force is called lift
that's got a bit of a curve you must have wrapped it too tight
i didn't want it getting wet and warped again steady on old thing gently does it
there you'll be able to see where you're going with these that'll stop your eyes watering when you go fast watch out he's taking off
i'll get you oh oh missed
don't worry he's still attached to the rope he can't go far
he can now we'll lose our mammoth
look he's coming back
he's flying all by himself
come on good boy come back here and have a nice snack
there's a good boy then
the mammoth had flown like a glider the simplest kind of winged aircraft it's pulled along the ground until it's fast enough for the lift generated by the wings to exceed its weight the glider then rises into the air and flies after release from its tow rope it continues to move forward as it drops slowly pulled by a thrust force due to gravity the friction with the air produces a force called drag that holds the glider back the two pairs of opposing forces lift and weight thrust and drag act on all aircraft
pilbeam frank what's that mammoth of yours doing on my pile of awning material
it was around this time that i began to take a profound interest in the progress of mammoth flight and the islanders' approach to it
come on you can do it just give it another try
now that you're rested we'll soon have you airborne
however fast the mammoth ran he couldn't take off so
you'd better have these you deserve them
everyone decided that the best way for the mammoth to get airborne must be to give it wheels and use some onboard propulsion
with the skates he'll zoom down the runway are you going to push him no i've got a much better idea trunk power
what's that i'll show you come on everybody gather round
now what you've all got to do is take deep breaths with your mouth and blow the air out of your nose as hard as you can olive are you out of your mind or something no auntie brenda just please do as i ask trust me now all we need is some direction dad pilbeam get him to point his trunk backwards
brilliant absolutely brilliant
but however hard he tried he couldn't accelerate to the speed at which he'd soar into the air there was just not enough lift it had seemed such a brilliant idea the islanders as ever would not give up they were resourceful
we need something that will push the mammoth up into the air we haven't much time all the deliveries are terribly late
we'll need something strong and powerful
i had to stop them putting a huge jet on the mammoth's back cos it was too dangerous and the mammoth could have come to harm as there was no way to control his flight at that moment the factory owner returned from holiday when he heard about the experiment he stopped worrying about awning deliveries and went into the aircraft industry the aircraft he built was controlled by this control column and these pedals pull the column back and the elevators on the tail deflect the airflow the tail drops and the nose rises so the aircraft climbs conversely you push the column forwards the airflow makes the tail rise and the nose drop and the aircraft dives press the pedals to one side and the rudder deflects airflow causing the aircraft to turn it is necessary to push the column to the side to roll the aircraft so that it turns smoothly
i'm so excited i've never been overseas before
how could you afford all this
that kind man who owned the awning factory gave the tickets to me it was a thank you for some ideas we gave him
that's nice one thing's worrying me though
what's that i'm missing our mammoth already
i wonder how he is
if it wasn't for you i'd still be making awnings when i wake up early in the morning i lift my head i'm still yawning when i'm in the middle of a dream i stay in bed float up stream float up stream please don't wake me no don't shake me leave me where i am i'm only sleeping hey hey hey hey everybody seems to think i'm lazy well i don't mind i think they're crazy running everywhere at such a speed till they find there's no n. e. e. e. ed
there's no need
oh lift your hand just like so move it around and say hello hello hello how are you hello hello it's good to see you i say hello i'm happy that you came i say hello please tell me please tell me please tell me your name hello i'm justin look at my book here are photographs this is my dad

it's all within the rules
the public clamour will not go away they will all be tarred with the same brush as for a security risk i suppose the real risk will go to their neighbours because house prices will plummet
if you want to find out it does have these people there are ways to do it as the judge said
even the worst report on the worst newspaper can probably find an address it is absurd l. don't think you need to have the addresses but you do need to have the expenditure people who pass things like the ten p. tax have no idea of the way their constituency lives and it's only because there has been a huge row in their constituencies but they have suddenly now panicked but they
we will raise the issue of responsibility to protect we leave ourselves open to consider the possibility of it drops everybody who was on the ground and every aid agency advising us says the best way of getting aid quickly to burmese people is to continue pressure on the burmese government
gordon brown speaking at pmqs on wednesday we can talk now to the b. b. c.'s andrew harding who is in thailand where diplomatic efforts are now focused andrew a bit on that in a moment but what of the aid agencies telling you on the ground about how much help is able to get through
they are not getting nearly enough help that's the main problem they are facing on the ground a lot of rain in the last couple of days that's making matters very difficult restrictions are being imposed on the delta by the burmese militia not allowing teams in a lot of people still living out in the open in very very grim conditions urgently needing help some aid is certainly getting through every day more people are being reached and more aid is getting through aid agencies are saying in the end we will be able to muddle through somehow or another people are still waiting for this potential spike a new wave of deaths cholera or typhoid or any other diseases start to get hold in some of these very grim conditions in these camps
i mention the diplomatic efforts on going l. understand there is a summit next week to try and kick start things
that's a summit in singapore and ministers from regional countries in south east asia will be there and a lot of people will be looking for a lot of leadership from them because these are the countries which have the best contacts and perhaps the best relations with the generals inside burma so i think there is real hope these countries can make a breakthrough and at least get some more mystical teams inside burma whether or not they can make massive breakthrough it's looking increasingly unlikely people feel that certainly the leadership in burma remains very hard line even if some of the more junior generals and officials on the ground do seem to recognise that they can't do this on their own
i andrew thanks by much for joining us we've been joined by the minister for international development gareth thomas what evidence do you have that aid is starting to get through to where it is needed
we had a flight which we packed with some relief surprise which we had stopped in the region which was able to land earlier this week and we have got another four flights going in over the course of the next few days we are seeing in that very direct way evidence that aid is getting through
is it being disseminated around the country by n. g. o.'s all been distributed by the burmese militia
no it's through the world food programme or british n. g. o. s. or their partners in the region none of the aid of money we are giving or have set aside to pay for the costs of responding to this disaster goes to the burmese junta it's going to organisations we have worked with for long period of time and we have confidence in them that it will get through to the areas it's needed
why can't you do more if the channels are there what's the problem
as your reporter said we need more trained help us in the areas hit by the cyclone able to disperse much more quickly than a able to do at the moment there is a shortage of aid workers that's why we are frankly disappointed with the way visas are being stopped for humanitarians to get into the country we have been pressing the polite and
very hard to see what else they can do the burmese regime is xenophobic we have got to put pressure on thailand china and other asian countries mike brown is in asia now trying to do that l. like the simplicity of the idea of ear drops but of course it wouldn't work
quite often it kills the people you're trying to save because if you do a job and it happened in the balkans and northern iraq people rushed towards whatever is coming down and sometimes they are knocked out but also it means the most corrupt energetic tend to get the aid and not the people who need it it's a lovely romantic idea but it can't work
quite a contrast with the way work the chinese authorities are dealing with the her quick earth quake
it's extraordinary the first and i went to china was in nineteen seventy seven in a nineteen seventy six there was a great earthquake which people refer back to the biggest one ever think to and and fifty thousand died the chinese have ben refused to admit it had happened a two hundred fifty thousand died the chinese refused to admit it had happened but chinese psychological mythology sometimes it is huge natural disaster they turn against the government banned what happened was chairman mao died the gang of four were arrested and people like me were let in of course it frightens the burmese because if they open their doors who knows what might happen
gareth is there a time limit on a diplomatic channels at some point if this goes on and on do you say enough we are going to take things into our own hands
i think we have to maintain the diplomatic route because in the end the best thing would be to have the co operation of the burmese authorities
if the
gareth thomas thanks by much for joining us amidst all the problems for gordon brown that have been piling up over the past few weeks little attention was paid to the biggest rebellion of his premiership thirty eight labour backbenchers defied the government whip to vote with the conservatives in favour of something called feed in tariff essentially set tariff paid to small scale producers of electricity to encourage them to invest in renewable technology the government won the day the amendment for the tariff was defeated but the issue will return to parliament later this year so what's all the fuss about giles has been to somerset to meet a feed in tariff enthusiast do not be fooled by the chocolate box loveliness and the wisteria blooms this is officially a big power station welcome to the world of micro hydro you are thinking picturesque converted water mill you're expecting to see big wheel aren't you not how it works here this propeller drives this yellow wheel which drives the belt which goes to the generator and we are generating electricity twenty kilowatts at the moment before the rain this morning it was seventeen water comes out at the other end there are no emissions the place still looks beautiful and you have powered sixty five rooms sounds simple and it should be but it isn't just getting tellisford up and running has been something of an upstream battle
not to have the same aim many mill owners and there are few one thousand you may be surprised to learn want incentives to get involved a fixed simplified some or feed in tariff
your water mill it is as simple as that but simple hydro seems not to
unfortunately the energy minister was not available to speak to us but we have been joined by the shadow environment secretary for the conservatives peter ainsworth tell us a little bit more about these feed in tariffs why are they such a good idea
i am really pleased that your film explained what feed in tariffs car it is very simple it is capable of revolutionising the way we do power in this country are also helping people to save energy wattages is essentially guaranteeing a long term price to anyone who spends the money what it is to install a piece of renewable or micro energy generation in their home or amongst their community or a local school or whatever there are all sorts of applications at the moment it is really complicated and bureaucratic the payback is uncertain the upfront investment is pretty large the scale that they have got in places like germany and denmark and holland is not here in our country
over two hundred seventy members of parliament signed a motion supporting this policy disappointed that the government rejected it
i am glad we have pin you down on the official side of the policy with the best will in the world all these tiny little micra generation projects is not going to fill the gap created by nuclear power stations coming out of string for example micro generation surely you will have to embrace something
is this a good idea or is it something which is just sort of quite minor and a bit gimmicky
strange mysterious things most people are not going to try and struggle with that unless they are very middle class retired and well off and feel like
matters is usually important
it is not so important as the economy amongst voters
this is only part of what will be a significant climate change programme this programme will give people money will pay people to do their own thing to be part of reducing their emissions and save energy if you look at what is likely to happen in the energy market in the years ahead it is likely to become an increasing issue for people in terms of household bills
thank you very much for coming in peter ainsworth this week has all been about gordon brown and his attempts to get his government back on track he has produced a surprise tax cut outlined new legislative bills and held a high profile press conference but has it done the trick it has to be says if gordon brown was a rock star and i think even he would admit that he is not he would be very pleased with top of the pots some good stories some not so good and yes of the second week running the ten p. tax has got in there once again at five doing the rounds at westminster at the moment there was a dapper chap called field who saw how much clout he could wield no ed balls didn't like it either and told him frankly to shut up at four as the economy gets sicker with a recent bout of mervyn's monetary melancholia doctor brown says he is the medicine to cure our economic ills the g. p. prescribes prudence and a dose of the bee gees three times a day which should lead to less belly aching at three one thing our prime minister has introduced that none of his predecessors did was the new heads up on legislation he'll be passing soon this not quite the queen's speech included eighteen not entirely new measures signalling that they not totally fightback had started cherie blair in between too much information relates angry gordon waving keys to number ten at tony
at least i don't have to worry about her running off with the bloke next door
week than he was at the beginning you could see a huge weight lifted off the shoulders of labour m. p.'s over the ten p. tax rate yes there
your necks out frank field said that he did nothing gordon brown would be around for the next election kevin do you think he will be yeah he will l. think he
will be because actually labour is not nearly as ruthless at getting rid of duff leaders as the tories are
and their leadership system makes it quite hard
yes i think that is a red herring because tony blair went without twenty per cent of m. p.'s saying off you go but i just think there is no one really who is standing out to challenge him the other thing is you don't just become up permanently bad politician overnight he has got to get that confidence back
a thing he has lost that but i do think he good take us into the next election i think they hung on to michael foot for years
on the bottom it seems to have some sort of special trademark
two teams two experts and an hour to bag a bargain welcome to wales and welcome to bargain hunt today we're at builth wells at the royal welsh showground one of the year's busiest fairs there are over one thousand stalls so plenty of opportunities to dig out those bargains each team gets three hundred to spend and if they make a profit at auction they get to keep it and any leftover lolly the expert spends on a bonus buy which may boost or lose their profits so no pressure then our teams today are both highly talented and creative first the reds sisters norma and patricia welcome to bargain hunt so patricia are you only sisters and were you good as children
we're not only sisters but great pals and we have two more sisters they'll be watching every moment enviously of course as children we were inquisitive imaginative and in trouble sometimes
good and as a child you decided what you wanted to do as a living
i did i always had a yearning to be a teacher and i grew up to be a teacher it's very rewarding it's been a great joy to me for thirty years one girl that i took through gcse with english and history did very well with a stars and became a teacher herself
very gratifying yeah so norma you're a writer i believe yeah
i try i started earning my living at writing when i worked for the south wales echo i wrote a consumer column for them i no longer get paid for it although i have completed my first novel and hope to get it published
gosh what a talented lot well what do you do with what bits of spare time you have left
i'm a very hands on grandmother and i like cooking italian food we often have ten for supper and we have very long sunday lunches
do you drink at all of course and do you collect i do i've got quite an eclectic taste i think that's the phrase
but i try to buy things that are by local artists good for you
i hope you get to buy some artistic items today but not before we meet the blues a happily married couple ruth and mervyn welcome to bargain hunt so how did you guys meet ruth
a long time ago a fellow asked me out and i was really excited but he only wanted me to cook for the party the next day
i thought you'd say he only wanted you for your body no i did
he wanted me to cook the salmon i went back to the party stinking and i was really upset and this guy offered me a drink he thought this is fishy business i want to get involved here
you're now a writer but it didn't start out that way that's right
after the birth of my two children i had severe post natal depression and anything to offset that so i entered competitions and that's how i ended up getting the cook of the realm for wales people started to ask me to cook for them and i eventually wrote a cookery book and had a little antique shop
what hasn't this woman done i made lingerie lingerie antiques
yes fish and fish but you're a writer now aren't you very much so tell us what you're into i got a cookery book published a long time ago then i have the memoir of me looking after my late mother who had anorexia that's called remembering judith
i worked for thirty years until my back gave in i now redesign and work on old buildings currently i'm working on a georgian building and we've converted it into a boutique hotel and coffee shop bar
what do you do in your spare time i'm a keen gardener i like to grow exotic fruits
this year i've got some nectarines and peaches and figs
they're not shrivelled up things no they're lovely flavours give them to ruth to cook i do this is the money moment here's the three hundred thank you you know the rules your expert awaits off you go can you read between the lines and tell me who will win today will it be the imaginative reds or the talented blues cooking up some treats with the reds is mark stacey whilst the guiding light for the blues is david harper
it's sixty you get a lot for your money
you do but i think we'd get a lot more for our money if you smiled at the dealer and got that price down i'll leave you to chat to the dealer and get it down for us
it has been known see you later thank you
she's a lady
patricia twinkled the porcelain down to a sunny forty quid
merv david hello what do you think of this
what do you like about it i love the carving
it's so beautiful the pattern around the wood it just looks a lovely piece of furniture
we love it we love it the bad news is something like this
a few years ago would have been hundreds and hundreds of pounds but brown furniture even lovely pieces have gone off the boil however it's price relative one hundred forty five would have been a steal five years ago but it needs to be negotiated to make some profit who's the keen negotiator out of you two ruth i'll send her in really yeah miss sparkly shall we go a moroccan haggler i am come on come and do your bit
the sweetest things are there for you help yourself take a few that's what i want you to do
norma patricia look what i've found what is it well apart from being a plate i looked at the scene and thought there's norma in yellow and patricia in peach and there's me playing my mandolin charming isn't it and very cute you are it has been said a decorative item and a plate when we look on the back it's got marks for meissen early twentieth century hand painted with this rather nice gilt border it's a typical eighteenth century scene even though it's two hundred years later the nice thing is it's marked up at sixty and i've had a quiet word with the dealer she's offered it to us for forty five so if you two like it i think we ought to do the deal
i like it even more now absolutely
these words are my own threw some chords together the combination d. e. f. it's who i am it's what i do i was gonna lay it down for you
ever wondered what great aunt mabel's pot is worth check it out on our website you could end up being potty about pots
trying to find the magic trying to write a classic
look what i've found oh mervyn ruth's gonna love this
oh i think it's absolutely gorgeous
she is absolutely gorgeous and a nice size too isn't she but it's a spelter figure i think i don't think it's bronze it has been gilted at some point you can see where she was gold
i think it doesn't harm at all because where it's worn it emphasises the face so beautifully she reminds me a bit of a modigliani sculpture or painting i think she's lovely she reminds me of something out of flash gordon
mervyn we like her you like her are we gonna like the price well she's thirty eight
i'd pay that to buy her for our home but we have to be realistic and we've got to make a profit so what do you feel
well i feel that you need or you need to go and charm them
i'll have to do my haggling it's down to you let's go good luck
mervyn kept his head for only twenty eight
come on and jump to the beat jump
come closer come closer and listen
the beat of my heart keeps on missing
guys give it up don't give up your day job look what i've found while you've been messing about
that's rather nice what attracted you to it i just like it
it's feminine and pretty i like that era
very classical isn't it yes classical pose what we've got is a porcelain figure of a lady draped in this rather diaphanous gown she's obviously emblematic of peace as she's just about to release the dove of peace it's in what looks like ivory but it's actually what we call blush ivory a simulated ivory and if we look for the mark we'll find it's royal worcester what sort of age do you think it is
i'd guess about nineteen twenty or possibly nineteen ten somewhere round there
would it be art deco or art nouveau in style
neither but there's a very good way of dating royal worcester if you count the little dots either side and the dots underneath and add them to the year one thousand eight hundred ninety two you come up with the date
so twenty and one thousand eight hundred ninety two is
nineteen twelve absolutely and that's when the figure was made
i think it's quite nice but what worries me norma is the price
the lady is asking one hundred seventy five which i think is maybe a bit over our it is a little bit rich isn't it
but it's a quality item and you two are quality birds of course
thank you very much we need to get that price down
and even if we don't make a profit we'll have a nice quality figure so you need to negotiate on that price and good luck thank you see you later
the worcester lovely stretched the reds to one hundred fifty woof now is the time to test the experts' creative drive can they find an item that is going to boost their team's profits or will they simply find something that nose dives at the auction the pressure the pressure
yeah i like it i'm sure somebody will love him
my daughter would adore him our daughter would as well
and the paint is still intact he's smashing i really like him
and hopefully at auction somebody might think the same thing we hope so we really hope so
and david got the blues' last buy for twenty time's up now for the teams the reds think this sunny tea set will serve up a treat at auction forty five for this meissen will have the bidders eating out of their hands but will the one hundred fifty for this lady of quality be equally attractive that was great wasn't it it was you did really well to spend two hundred thirty five indeed which item will bring the biggest profit the plate we got that in unison sixty five leftover lolly here you go mark thanks
that's not bad good old wodge for you
have you got anything in mind a couple of things yes very coy
i'm keeping it completely quiet go and get 'em yes good luck
i think the art deco lady we like the little art deco bust

a very special nice early proper antique that i think my blue team are really gonna like
thirty two pieces what's it worth we've got both teapots which is a bonus so we've gone for sixty to one hundred
forty paid that's a very good buy next up is the meissen crimped edged plate which is not so jolly really is it
no an early twentieth century example transfer printed very cheap way of decorating something
you're not fond of this plate it's not to my taste
it's out of fashion i think it'll make ten or fifteen oh dear forty five paid
not so good mr. stacey next is the worcester blush figure the least popular of worcester's wares the market's not so buoyant what's the matter with her she's got too many robes on really you'd rather she was naked i wouldn't suggest that i would she'd look much better starkers
i think she'd make a bit more if she had a bit more exposed
with her clothes on how much sixty to one hundred oh dear i'd get her clothes off quick they paid one hundred fifty does it stand a chance i think it's a bit punchy really they're gonna need their bonus buy now norma patricia you gave mark sixty five yes
we did sixty five of your leftover lolly what did you buy mark
i bought this oh yes we remember that oh we loved that
we liked it that's great
it's a nutcracker in the form of punch and judy made in bronze
obviously very popular with the ladies we thought it was cute what's cute about it the fact that punch thumps judy no you've got the two characters from the story
back to back then you have a bit of violence when they crack the nuts all right very nice
people collect nutcrackers and punch and judy so you've got two fields there i'd like to see it making a little bit maybe twenty more
as much as that that'd be good a potential twenty profit
you don't have to decide now for the audience at home we'll show it to the auctioneer he liked them do you like them i think they're quite fun really
punch and judy is always popular but they're made out of a low value material copper coated cast iron
oh right so this is cheap cast iron faked up to look like bronze what are they worth i don't really rate them probably ten to fifteen
for the novelty factor ten to fifteen
practical practically hideous
it's just a bit of fun what's that worth a five note on a good day
i think it's worth five or ten they paid twenty
they probably paid twice as much as what it'll get in the auction it's difficult to estimate yeah now the spelter bust that's extremely stylish isn't it
yes very much so that is the age of jazz it says it all it typifies a period it's a shame she's not bronze she's made of spelter a low grade material she was cheap in her day cheap in her day anyway it's stylish very much from a period
what's your estimate we've put forty to sixty they paid twenty eight so david will be well pleased with that jolly good the third item is this swing mirror my gosh you get a chunk of mahogany for one hundred ten absolutely
unfortunately swing or toilet mirrors are not as buoyant as they were five or ten years ago
it dates from one thousand eight hundred forty one thousand eight hundred fifty i would have thought so nice and chunky like me what's it worth

good afternoon welcome to friday's working lunch changing tides in the water industry the regulator calls for more competition in who supplies your water on the markets b. a. announces eight hundred million in profits but the boss's bonus is grounded coming up we will be answering your wills and probate questions and what about a french dish this lunch time
i'm jean christophe novelli i'm about to open my new restaurant why don't you join me
my answer to it is as follows an executor is bound when he administers an estate to do so with what is known as the utmost good faith and if from the nature of the question that hasn't happened the executor is clearly in breach of his duty ultimately an action can be brought in court to compel him to carry out his duties as an executor the simple route if one was going through a court would be to bring an action for an inventory and an account but if we were to take an extreme example where an executor was frittering away estate funds then one could look under section fifty of the administration of justice act to bring an action for the removal of the personal representative what you in fact have is a breakdown of communication between the executor on the one hand and the people for whom he is trying to administer the estate so i would always counsel that in the first event one tries to communicate with the executor and solve the problem in that way the second thing i would like to say in relation to that is that very often going down the court route can be immensely expensive over the years i have compassionately to believe in what is known as alternative dispute resolution whereby using the format of a mediation the same result can be achieved but far more cheaply very often in the space of a single day and at a cost of only a few thousand pounds whereas when the thing goes to court the costs are far higher
monumental mess
this is the terminal five thing
flag on them are they the flag carrier do they represent britain it's a private company
i think it's a series of unfortunate events that have come at an unfortunate time the two need to be interlinked the seven per cent decrease in consumer confidence index clearly the gloom and the brand is in gloom as well
as a customer you think maybe british airways i don't trust them as much as i used to where else would i go easyjet that too has a problem it doesn't seem this is an industry with a reliable brand to go to
makers it is a price driven decision this it is not sitting in a cramped seat it doesn't matter if it is british airways or easyjet there is hardly any difference on short haul flights
you are right with the big profits and the big destinations for people's holidays it is the long haul flights and the extra service
there long enough l. think he could have done more at the time now it
flight for them brand rebuilding
will you be travelling with them soon
two weeks' time
investors are being fleeced of millions of pounds by gangs poses
how do you do
it is
good ambience good food of course some good wine and being comfortable and the chance of coming over several time a week if you want to before we are aiming at a different price bracket where we also respect the fact that the economy has changed since three years ago
you mentioned the economy is this a good time to be opening restaurants
no yes of course there is always a good time we know just you know throwing yourself in the air and trying we believe in what we do we have a great brand name we already have success from the first one therefore yes i agree the economy is probably not at its best there is still a lot of people who are willing to come you know and have a great time you are not going to pay one hundred twenty a head what you are paying is the food which we will buy locally there's a lot of farms and markets who are producing some great produce organic some good venison some good beef what we are going to do is not stop people by putting a huge amount of excess of price
so if customers aren't paying one hundred a head what will they
let's talk about you as a businessman you have had your ups and downs how have you managed to bounce back from that
thank you for bringing small details like this thank you to let me know once i was bankrupt
very well the mistake that we are not doing now is the fact that we are not opening so quickly not trying to be too spontaneous we are not trying to push the brand name so quickly when you think it took just under two years to move to number two i have opened seven places in less than eighteen months therefore you can see clearly who is the most cautious
the first time round you are opening restaurants very quickly
yes that was the mistake everybody makes a mistake l. l. paid for that l. learned a valuable lesson i've moved on from there tomorrow it will be something else and that is what life is about it's not about the things are you blast it's the millions that you make it's about to have a positive
our view is that's why it's important to take a progressive step approach to opening this market we believe that if we open the market to business customers we can put in place the systems to ensure that that works then we can demonstrate the benefits of that competition to be offset against the costs and ensure that all customers benefit from competition in time
the current regime none of the two thousand two hundred businesses who could change suppliers have done it that's because there are too few of them it means there is less incentive for the companies to provide them with a good deal less incentive for them to change under the new regime the idea is you would move to over one million company's first of all there would be greater incentive for the market to start working there
there should be some alarm bells ringing here because we do have choices in some utilities like gas and electricity yet there has been something of a free for all and a huge fuss about how that has been managed a lot of
at the moment customers have no choice therefore the only protection they have is from ofwat who regulates prices and the quality of service to customers if customers have a choice particularly business customers and sixty four per cent of them have told us they want a change industry structure to get a choice they can then choose and pressurise their supply into delivering the services they want not the services that the regulator thinks they may want that's a very powerful tool
price regime and there will be in the one they are getting ready for that won't start until two thousand fifteen which has seven years hence they will try and put a lot of the structures in place so they can start experimenting with a after that it's not going to happen tomorrow but these things come along quite quickly and the business changes will happen earlier
the grid system in the water industry is hugely sonko with big economic costs pushing water around the country from an environmental perspective is very costly and environmentally unfriendly in terms of helping to deliver efficiency to retailers selling water it isn't going to be a huge help to that
do you think that choice and competition is always going to be the best option particularly when you are thinking of water
i think that needs to be balanced with a whole range of other concerns in the water industry the water industry and waste water sector has a huge environmental responsibility and a
rolling out competition to other businesses and then smaller businesses and i think house for competition is a long way away until it is provan to be able to deliver benefits proven not to have the down side effects in terms of delivering poor water quality and other efficiencies particularly relating to damage to water resources there's an awful lot for the competition process to prove its benefit outside of purely the cost benefit and price benefit
surely there is strong argument to say that competition whilst it might reduce the cost could cause other problems surely it will mean the companies don't want to invest in storage of water because they have to reduce their costs it could make our drought problems even worse goodness knows we have been up hosepipe bans in that south
potential confusion is one of the most important factors relating to this development of competition in this sector not just confusion from the householder but also confusion in terms of wider government policy and who takes responsibility for what we have seen that with the summer flooding and the response to that who is responsible local authorities water utilities environment agency private property owners l. think there is potential for confusion in terms of responsibility
to ensure that customers are protected particularly vulnerable customers and the tariffs or if one person is getting cheaper tariffs then those costs are reflected in more expensive tariffs for poorer and people it is a universal service that universal coverage issue needs to be considered and taken into account that it is an equitable process of competition
let's get back to the world of
wills with henry so did
contesting will when a legal challenge is made by other family members just how much stock is given to the fact that the will set out the actual wishes of the deceased regardless of the wishes
of others clearly where a
of others has signed a will complying with
all the formalities that the wills act sets out that document is an important document but to address very clearly the question that is being asked i have to say in all honesty a will is not always written in stone the reason for that is an act called the inheritance provision for family and dependants act nineteen seventy five of which came into force as long ago as nineteen seventy six that act provides that if the testator or tested three is domiciled in england and wales then one out of a class of six people six classes of people who are set out in section one of the act asked able to challenge a will if the challenge is successful then the will can be written in part or in whole family members are clearly within the section one category the act which is quite complicated provides that the court will weigh up the financial means and resources of the applicant as against the beneficiaries who are mentioned in the will and there are various other aspects set out in the act which a carefully considered this could give a very different result to that which the person who had signed his will in a very valid form of thought would be the case
other factor that comes in there is that unless there are certain circumstances applicable that challenge needs to be made within six months of the data that the grant of probate has been obtained date otherwise you're too late to make that challenge unless there are certain specified circumstances available which would allow you to bring a claim out of time it would be the quarter that were essentially in those circumstances be rewriting the will the court
it must
be expensive too it can be expensive the number of inheritance act claims as they are known is on the increase that is particularly the case where people have done home made wills and have not given enough thought to the possibility that a family member or someone who is dependent on the deceased and that is defined in the act has not been had provision made for them
this one that often comes up this is from peter madsen there are many versions of plant will be available in stores and solicitors' fees are seemingly exorbitant what are the
retired solicitors who are still providing this service to the community at large others are unqualified people but they really do understand the area my difficulty is that because so far as i'm aware there is no registration body as there is for solicitors it is sometimes difficult for a member of the public to gauge the expertise of the particular person they're going to that can have unfortunate results
we have even more thanks for now as we were saying massive profits for british airways and elissa bayer from insinger de beaufort is
airways suffering whatever you might think about the brand it's made a tonne of cash in an unbelievably difficult market how has it done that
willie walsh has done well on that point of view and they have made a terrific amount of money and what he said was that from now on it will be much more difficult and british airways will have problems because of the other things associated with their name the brand i think has suffered in the last few months and that is something they will have seen a fall in passenger numbers
one of their major costs must be oil and oil prices have gone through the roof they buy a lot of their oil in advance so they may have protected themselves
of the market is
it is huge where they make all the money they make it from business travel and the answer is when you have problems at the moment particularly in the financial sector they are cutting back on that travel and they are saying people need to go economy to be fair that is fairly well shortlived the other thing is discretionary spending should affect holidays most of those
it is difficult to be rude about the media being on it there is talk and actuality figures are showing yes there is a downturn in the retail but on holidays there's not big falls as yet
what grabbed your attention this week
it tended to be a commodity week eurasian is a new stock
that is the effect of commodity prices rio tinto was fifty nine at the end of april and it is nearly seventy
one has to be careful commodity prices a ten rise in less than a month on a stock like that is huge what we are saying is demand continues to be strong and the quality of earnings of those companies so it is not like a dot com bubble you are seeing support for those shares
i rang around some of the big investment houses this week and asked for their predictions l. was really bowled over how positive everyone was generally people thought the markets should hold where we are now
six thousand five hundred at the end of the year
and financials are at the bottom then if that starts to fall through banks are an enormous sector you have a mismatch at the moment between what is happening in the market and with what is happening at how banks are lending
if there is a mismatch in the end that will out and there will be a problem on the market
the market is saying that things are not as bad as people say and corporate profits on
there are certain differences as an english lawyer i wouldn't venture to comment on scottish law the question that has been asked over here it would require the question of whether the grant obtained either here or in scotland would be recognised by the other place because they are then you would be able to admin zer administer the estate
would you have to two lawyers
possibly but i am sure they would do it in a cost effective way
my father died in november two thousand seven he left a very simple will drawn up in nineteen eighty five leaving all his assets to his six children one child died in nineteen ninety five the executor a beneficiary in the will has decided to divide his estate into six parts to include the five remaining children named in the will and the deceased beneficiary surviving daughters is this correct or should his estate
it could certainly be valid the more burning question is whether the will was so expressed as to deal with worldwide assets and even more importantly given the seychelles aspect whether it accorded with seychelles law if it did then having it apostilled over here that would mean it would have to be authenticated every notary has his or her signature in the u. k. in a format that can be accepted and known that it is actually their signature and that is what apostilling means then you can send it out to the seychelles and it could be validly utilised over there subject to the law requirements for a will having been complied with
let's hear from a viewer sheila's husband died in march two thousand seven and his estate was under the inheritance tax threshold this
you spin me right round this is a biscuit this is a melted block of pellet we form it into this shape using the cup on our
it is done by these clamping down on top then from there we will move across between the blocks where a pin will come down and to make the hole in the centre of the biscuit before the ram goes up and presses the record into that we require
the vinyl industry is alive and kicking and very strong it was revived in the nineties and has carried on strongly since it shows little sign of reducing or growing it's become a niche business for collectors particularly and shows no sign of decline
tell me who are
object to some people it's an object almost of art particularly the sleeve and the graphics they like the sleeve notes they liked to have something that is tactile something they can pick up and feel and look at as well as listen to
biggest vinyl market in europe we are in it we can provide service within one or two days our quality is superb our machines are the best with those we think we can continue to hold out
maintaining this level of business but we do expected to become even more of they must have a collectible we think the packaging will become more exotic we think we will see even more coloured records picture records it will
on tuesday there is a lot
what you megabit
their share price has fallen a long wait they will be an indicator if things are getting better imperial tobacco a tobacco company whether they're having a rights issue they are way behind british american tobacco there are talks of whether there will be a rights issue for that to get more cash in
the is there an issue for the market as a hold
everyone is always interested in marks and amp spencer
that will be interesting retail is poor rose they have made a lot of statements of what is going on they have done a lot of things to reposition that the answer is that
the yield is a measure of how much dividends their pain we said generally dividends yields is good but the point is that we haven't heard from every one yet don't you think that people will start cutting back their dividends
you're not saying that anywhere
mother kay are going to have difficult figures tate and amp lyle has probably been one sugar sales have been bad they kept coming up with bad reports it will be interesting to see if they can produce something better
you are somewhere special now aren't you
i am i'm going to the palace for a meeting about the duke of edinburgh award
i came from difficult background my family were new age travellers i travelled around and didn't get schooling i started quite long time back about sixty five years ago when i first went there they were
one of the first ports of call l.
have an idea l. l. was twenty one years old l. knew what i wanted to do but didn't really know about how going to achieve that
but none in business l. had no real idea about the steps that needed to be taken to go into business they go through a process of helping you go through a business plan they also investing you l. had a loan from them of three thousand five hundred one of the things that is quite key to it is that you get a mentoring programme and access to advice from marketing p. r. and all the other areas that you need they said of small workshops and that kind of thing that was six point five years ago today we are
big benefit is their initial hard cash involved here
grants and loans for me it was purely on a loan basis it is invaluable i think it's the whole package that makes the real difference they did some surveys on it and its around thirty three per cent of people have had the whole programme go that much further than pure
they gave me loan of two thousand seven hundred i've almost finished paying it off now it is a loan system they make sure you can keep up with your payments a major your business is working and moving forward
the both strike me as very confident we do not have just been entrepreneurs anyway without this kind of help
i think i probably would have gone anyway i think the difference is when you do it how far you go l. was only twenty at that point l. had already been to other forms of banks and people like that without a background without your own start up capital they weren't willing to take the risk once i had been invested in from the trust very soon afterwards there was another body that invested in us once that had happened then the banks were willing to but at the very early stages they were not it may have happened but it might have
i would have tried without them but it's difficult to believe in yourself that much about that sort of support now i am starting a project called what's up information the aim of that is to get positive information to young londoners between the ages of twelve to nineteen to assist in their development and give them confidence and ideas and ways they can move forward in life hopefully that will help
government says hopes of finding survivors are fading but today a young child is pulled to safety attacked by football fans the policeman who was stamped on in
but was killed within five minutes when i arrived i heard they had stopped rescue work franz transmy
i don't know if my daush has been found in time
modern buildings shouldn't go down but it is easy to skimp on the building regulations you need building control and expert ease to ensure that buildings are constructed according to the code that doesn't seem to be happening
amid the overwhelming horror a few young people are still being pulled out of the ruins alive it gives rescuers some reward to set against the relentless tragedy of recovering the dead i'm fine she says china's housing minister says the sheer scale of this earthquake went far beyond the designed resistance of buildings in the region but the chinese government says it will investigate allegations of shoddy building and anyone guilty of using poor quality material also be severely punished let's get the latest from beichuan paul danahar is there for us what have you been seeing and hearing there today
former beijing correspondents we are a matter of months from the olympics this was meant to be china's great year on the international stage
and it's a year they've prepared for for eight years two thousand eight eight is a lucky number in china the opening ceremony is the eighth day of the eighth month of the eighth year and they have had a series of terrible catastrophies starting at the beginning of this year with blizzards which stopped millions of people going home for chinese new year and in mid march we had the rioting in tibet and the suppression of that and the they are watching events gripped by the drama and the only has one child they are watching parents waiting for four days scrabbling with their bare hands and identifying with that terrible experience and wanting to help to a degree i'm hearing from people they are uniting around the chinese government they think they have done a good job so far in dealing with the disaster people are volunteering in any way they can
swelling down
been hit on the elbow by a and i was trying to withdraw and i ended up on the floor the next thing i knew i was getting kicked in the body on the legs l. gnaw i was in serious trouble as the other officers had withdrawn up the street i thought i was going to start getting hurt l. l. was trying to get to my radio to activate my emergency button but couldn't get to it l. thought i've got to get out of here i'm in serious people as these people are going to seriously try and hurt me l. manage to do get up and run
when you were on the ground and all those kicks were going in did you think you were going to die
i try not to think about that at the time my impression is i'm going to get seriously hurt here when they were chasing me up the street i wouldn't say they were trying to kill me but if they had got me they would have seriously hurt me
there were a lot of problems on wednesday night what it was biggest single problem
alcohol those particularly people were out to cause harm to any police officer it could have been me or anybody they had been throwing bottles or missiles anything they could at us they were drunk if it hadn't been me it would have been somebody else they were fighting among themselves if it hadn't been me or another police officer it would have been a rangers fan
what's happened here has damaged the reputation of british football in europe next week it is the champions league final chelsea against manchester united in moscow an even bigger night for football on the pitch and off it despite the threat of pilot strikes big increases in the cost of fuel and the disastrous opening of heathrow's terminal five british airways made pre tax profits of nearly nine hundred billion in the last financial year that's an increase of forty five per cent on the year before our transport correspondent tom symonds is at heathrow
after the bad news in these parts british airways will have been pleased with its results this morning the record profit the payouts to shareholders and the boss willie walsh not taking his bonus following the problematic opening of terminal five he argued strongly this morning that the airline is strong enough to weather the coming storm in this the aviation industry oh what a year british airways and willie walsh have seen it all in the last twelve months from a dramatic air crash miraculously without fatalities to a conviction for collusion and price fixing to the glittering prompts and disastrous debut of terminal five this morning b. a.'s new home was functioning well a huge leap in profits eight hundred eighty three million been tax but there is another amount b. a. spent on fuel so how has the airline done it it's passed on to passengers some of the cost of that fuel it's carrying more of them especially in the front end of the plane more cargo and it's cut costs but willie walsh admitted the service need to do improve
we look back on the whole year and say what lessons can we learn what's can we do better what are we determined to address and deliver better service
the whole industry is faced with rising cost of fuel british airways says that could put its costs up by one billion in the year ahead we see general economic slowdown and increasing competition for british airways particularly on routes to north america
as for willie walsh difficult times may be ahead but he is intent on staying in his high pressure job in the last hour we have been able to ask passengers about willie walsh's lack of bonus and the general reaction has been nice gesture from one passenger another wanted the money back in cheaper first tom thank you a judge has ruled that the murderer jeremy bamber should spend the rest of his life in prison for killing five members of his family at their essex farmhouse in nineteen eighty five he has always protested his innocence the husband of a television make up artist diane chenery wickens who hasn't been seen since january has been rearrested on suspicion of her murder after human remains were found in woodland in east sussex david chenery wickens had been on police bail now to burma and the aftermath of the cyclone there today the country's prime minister said the emergency relief phase is now over and rebuilding is beginning but a b. b. c. reporter who's in the worst affected area the irrawaddy delta says there is little sign of help from the government from neighbouring thailand andrew harding reports exclusive footage from deep inside burma's disaster zone mud wreckage and still barely a hint of outside help two weeks after the cyclone the only house left from a whole village the survivors here not starving yet but waiting anxiously for aid to reach them
there are still as i understand it pockets where people have not yet been able to be contacted you need to understand this is huge area in atrocious conditions floodwaters still around heavy rain every day bridges which are impassable and bad roads
but the problems aren't just logistical burma's prime minister tour as government camp he claimed the initial emergency stage of this disaster was over that reconstruction work was the priority but the outside world is still begging the military to open up and allow in foreign teams and much more aid
china's president says the rescue operation after the earthquake has entered its most crucial phase it's cardiff against portsmouth we'll be previewing an historic f. a. cup final and is it a good time to jump into the capital's uncertain housing market it is sixty five years since the famous dambuster raids against germany during the second world war only one of the pilots who took part in still alive and to mark the anniversary of the mission he has been alongside hundreds of people watching special fly past at the reservoir in derbyshire where the pilots trained our correspondent danny savage is there exactly six and a half decades ago today the dam busters raid did
take place and today there was
i feel a great deal of pride in the fact that i took part in the damp raid we trained on the derwent water we were actually lining up to those two towers as the main objective of our approach
fly past but even lower and at night how on earth they did it none of us can ever work out now
so a unique piece of history in front of an ever dwindling number of people who were there and it should be pointed out that the motto of the battle of britain memorial flight is lest we forget there was memorial service here today to remember not only crews who died sixty five years ago but the civilians who died as well when those dams were broken joining me here this afternoon his squadron leader al pinner from the battle of britain memorial flight her special was it for you to have les munroe the last pilot here
incredibly special and we are commemorative unit and we do many of these events but being there with les munroe johnny johnson families from barnes wallis it makes it all special
how much part of rfo core is it
it is ingrained in the national psyche not just aria focal l. do the people can comprehend how difficult a task it was to put everything together and end up with those aircraft at night over occupied territory being shot out at sixty f. t. and releasing the bombs spot on target
fewer and fewer veterans are around these days so how important is your job
well we say there were three main aims the commemorative and so termonia the promotion and inspirational i think we have achieved all three today commemorative and ceremonial
so a very special tribute here today something that is very unique which is why so many people came along to see it fourteen m. p.'s including gordon brown and david cameron are to be forced to reveal details of their expenses connected with their second homes it follows a defeat in court morning for the house of commons which wanted to keep the details secret let's get more from our political correspondent what does this actually mean now
he shot off into a puff of smoke he went over the top of the bike and landed on the road
a shadow had already been cast over the north west two hundred by the death of another rider martin finnegan two weeks ago it made his friend consider his long term future in the sport he has been racing again
i do did anybody is thinking about the match in terms of one million but trying to win the f. a. cup
we are cardiff city and we are going to wembley
like cardiff to the f. a. cup final
eighty compared with two shillings and sixpence it is a lot different these days
and how things have changed today pompey players are just about millionaires all they have brought great joy to a club starved of success in the intervening sixty nine years
they deserve it they support their club and if we can make them proud of their team that is all that matters to me i have got no other it is not for me l. l. have not got a big ego i just do a job work for the club work for the fans if we win the cup for them i will be happy man
they know a thing or two
happy man about getting things

yeah oh yeah one glass of red wine too many after the meeting last night
one of my patients has the best hangover cure a large plate of tripe and a glass of warm sweet milk
shouldn't you be at the campus surgery

i thought we'd go out after morning surgery
go where my driving lesson
don't you remember
oh yeah um
you haven't changed your mind no
no no
i'm rather excited
i should've stayed in bed today
try not to get the dressing wet and i'll see you again soon bye so madam where were you last night
sorry the meeting about this place at julia's house i did tell doctor woodson i wouldn't be able to make it
yeah but it was your idea it went really well by the way
really yeah you should've been there i know maybe next time
so why couldn't you come
we've got davey's sister staying and we'd booked a meal i couldn't get out of it julia wasn't annoyed was she with me not being there
no of course not anyway i'll fill you in later hi are you jade yeah do you want to come through so how are you feeling today
not so bad right well the scan results are back i'm afraid you've got gallstones gallstones my mother had those they're not hereditary
no but now we know what's causing the pain i'd like to refer you to a surgeon at saint phil's
i have to have an operation it may not come to that but i think it's best you see him but the pain's nearly gone
are you sticking to the low fat diet
definitely and it's made a big difference i'd just be wasting the surgeon's time
the thing is the infection could flare up at any moment so it's really best you go and see him have you got someone to look after you
my husband and i are separated but i'll be perfectly fine i do appreciate what you're saying thank you but i'm feeling so much better lately so there's really no need but really doctor there's no point
yeah i will thank you i'm ready nice gloves
sensible shoes i like to be prepared
quite right we've all seen the three inch heels george drives in now
are you laughing at me doctor west
you ready as i'll ever be i'll drive it out of the car park and then you take over
don't worry i can do it
what are you doing
checking the tyres
just get in the car vivien right do you know what all the controls are for
but you're in a lot of pain not half as bad as it was it's getting worse did you tell the doctor you can't just ignore it
do you remember this one it was your last school photograph when it came through you wouldn't show it to me
it's horrible
no it's not but i do remember telling you off cos you hadn't brushed your hair
hi i called earlier but there was no answer
i i i was out
how's things fine thanks what did you want my road tax needs renewing i've got to get some car documents i think they're upstairs
you didn't need to drive so fast i was going within the speed limit vivien when it says you can drive at forty miles an hour it doesn't mean you have to drive at forty miles an hour round bends
i'm a safe driver don't worry
you're not a driver at all you haven't passed your test
it's just a technicality
well if i was reversing i would be backwards wouldn't i
that kerb's not straight
i miss you i know you do dad and i miss your mum too and she misses you i just wish your mum didn't if she'd just don't give up on her dad please don't give up on her
it's here somewhere i've got to have it
i'll have another look but not right now call back later if you like
you all right
yeah fine
you've lost weight i had it to lose and you look tired
any more compliments i'm not getting at you i just
he's worried about you mum we both are
i'll call by later
bye dad
he can't wait to get away
he doesn't like arguing
i get so lonely without
why didn't you tell him how you feel
if only he'd understand why don't we get out for a bit
yeah why not
this wheel doesn't turn enough
as you get nearer to the kerb you turn the wheel in the opposite direction
and why would i want to do that because it lines up your wheels for when you reverse but surely hey who's the experienced driver here
oh kindly refrain from doing that it's totally unnecessary
sorry sorry
now look what you've gone and made me do remember when me and your dad brought you here so you could learn to ride your bike
and i kept falling off you hurt your knee you wouldn't stop crying and dad gave me a great big cuddle and bought me an ice lolly mum
what did you do that for
a pigeon was in the road a pigeon
vivien if there'd been a car behind us we'd have had an accident and what for a pigeon that doesn't know his highway code
there's no need to get shirty
it means it's pension day
is this what they call road rage
no it's what they call self preservation
you just like being in control you don't like it when somebody else else is in the driving seat
whoops oh the pain's easing up now
mum you don't look well
it's nothing to worry about it'll go
it won't and i am worried about you mum please
i'll be all right
let's get you home
don't worry about me but i do
you must call for the doctor
i just need a few hours sleep that's all i'll be fine
the pain's getting worse it's not going to go away
i don't want to go to hospital i don't want to leave you that's not fair on me
i don't like seeing you like this we're calling the doctor
hey how was the driving lesson
well if you must know
i'm not getting in a car with her ever again was it really that bad
it was a nightmare
she didn't listen to a word i said
she wouldn't stop talking don't do this don't do that you're going too slow you're going too fast
but i thought she could drive oh she can everybody up the wall
it's not easy teaching someone else to drive
maybe she was nervous
nerves of steel that one
she made me a nervous wreck
you mustn't let one bad lesson get you down i'm not so what's the plan now then
i wonder what she'll do about lessons now
i don't know or care as long as she doesn't ask me
well one things for sure i'm not letting her take me out again
it is extremely tender and distended you must've been in a lot of pain when i saw you earlier why didn't you say i was hoping it would go away and you've got a temperature you need to go to hospital no why not that's my business
just give me some more pills to stop this pain that's all i want
i can't you need to see a surgeon
i'll be all right
you're clearly not all right mrs. pendle you're very ill and i can't help you now let me call for an ambulance
no i'm not going anywhere and if you're not going to give me anything for this then please just go
i can't leave you like this
my daughter will look after me
is she here i don't know i'd like to have a word with her
leave her alone she must be able to see how much pain you're in you're making me tired please just go away
you're showing signs of peritonitis if nothing's done about that you could die
well we've all got to go some time haven't we now please will you just go
so come on how did the driving lesson go
oh that's better
why didn't you let the doctor call for an ambulance
i never did get that washing out stop worrying about me katie i'll be all right
you won't and you know you won't
it doesn't matter
you busy i'm just about to eat that custard cream
but i can put it on hold what's up
i need your advice
i've got this patient who's got acute cholecystitis scan shows she's got gallstones has she seen a surgeon no she refuses to go i wanted her to then this afternoon she called me out she's in a lot of pain and i think she's showing signs of peritonitis
so what's the problem she won't go to hospital
flatly refuses to let me help
have you told her what the consequences could be if she does nothing why won't she go into hospital
she won't say she just refuses to go what do i do
you can't force a patient to accept treatment have you documented this in your notes yes so what do you think you should do
i don't know that's why i'm asking you
but she's your patient
you're my mentor i'm not your conscience
you have to be happy in yourself that you've done all that you can
but that's just it she won't let me help do you want to give up on her no then don't
you've answered your own question she's a sick woman a sitting target you're her doctor you're allowed to be concerned so i'll ask you again what do you think you should do
this isn't what i want and what about dad
terry will be all right
that is wishful thinking
hello no one home
doesn't seem to be oh but my wife said she'd be here
you mr. pendle i am yeah doctor bell you here to see april well sort of yeah she's not expecting me i was here
she's not well is she i'm sorry i can't i've got my old keys i shouldn't do it but
what are you doing here
i what's wrong with her
mrs. pendle you need to let me help you
how many more times i don't want your help now leave me alone
she should be in hospital
she won't go can't you make her i can't
tell me what's wrong with her you need to speak to her if you won't call for an ambulance i will
mr. pendle we can't force your wife to go she's got to agree to medical treatment this is stupid
i can't stand by and watch her
maybe if we get your daughter to speak to her
katie i understand she's been looking after her
i wanted to speak with her but mrs. pendle wouldn't let me if katie could just doctor bell
talk to as many student as possible hand out leaflets give on the spot advice and the students will know where to find us
sounds brilliant not bad eh
this place could have more patients than the mill
i really hope it does well i like this job
shame you couldn't make the meeting
i'd better get back on reception katie died about eighteen months ago it was a few weeks before she was about to go to university she wanted to be a teacher april and me decided to book a family holiday in greece we joked with katie that it'd probably be the last one she'd want to have with us old fuddy duddies
what happened
april and me were sitting on a beach katie went swimming couple of minutes later i saw this speed boat a big one completely out of control katie didn't stand a chance
i'm so sorry
april she she was in shock all the way home we both were but after a time you try and act normal get on with things get dressed get up in the morning go to work and somehow you manage to get by but she didn't
it must've been awful for you both it was
still is you never get over the loss of a child after we'd been back a while i'd come home from work and i'd hear april talking to herself she was having imaginary conversations with our daughter
she hadn't accepted that katie was dead
no no i don't think it's like that with her she goes to the cemetery every week but in here she can't let go i can hear my daughter's voice as clear as anything i can see her just by thinking of her but you have to let that moment pass but april holds on
has she seen anyone about it
no i was always on at her to see a bereavement counsellor or psychiatrist or whoever it is you see but she wouldn't
why didn't you come to the surgery and talk to one of us
my wife said she had problem is doctor she doesn't want to let go that's why i had to leave she said she could live without me but she can't live without katie
do you think that's why she won't accept any medical help
how do you mean
do you think she wants to be with katie
please she needs help
mrs. pendle april i know about katie
why did he have to tell you
he's worried about you
that's what katie says
and what does katie say about you refusing medical help
stop talking about her she's my daughter leave her out of it
she doesn't like seeing you like this does she
i don't want to leave her
but is that what she wants ask her
they said i could have a quick word i'm sorry for not being there for you i should never have walked out
i've been in my own little world
you need help april
why would i want help to stop seeing my own daughter she's our little girl terry it's all right i know i will get help i promise
i want to help you love and i will
come back home
you just get some rest huh
fancy going for a quick drink
i'd love to but i've got to get home hiya hi
taxi service can't be bad ruth was telling me about your sister how long she staying for staying where your place ruth said there was a meeting last night

what did you go and make up that stupid lie for my sister staying as if i'd have that lazy cow in the house
i wanted an excuse not to go

that's why i didn't go i do listen to you davey

she's been really nice to me
and where do you think you're going i give that three out of ten what the car the driving
are you testing me
well if i was i'd use the word reckless several times
have you felt better since you saw doctor granger
why can't i see him now no offence but you're only a nurse
i've had a report from a friend that he's a bit tactile
i was the one who was humiliated
thank you thank you very much indeed thank you so much hello and welcome to through the keyhole the target for today the homes of two celebrity home owners about to receive the keyhole treatment from our intrepid investigator lisa snowdon who's waiting now to tell us what's in store
if helen was the face that launched one thousand ships surely this was the face that launched a million slips it's model behaviour and everything's super i have to be very diplomatic when visiting people's homes i can't be cheeky should be politically correct and always have liberal views the clues are all there but who's playing the game today
who's playing the game today it's our panel and what a panel they are they're like hamsters cute cuddly but always running around in circles our first panellist thought about becoming a writer on history until she realised there was no future in it aah the name's bond jennie bond a legendary ballroom dancer our next panellist was sacked from his first job with the formation hokey cokey team of southampton when instead of putting his whole self in he waved it all about it's anton du beke our third panellist was once a presenter of disney club she was never grumpy never goofy too tall to be minnie and too beautiful to be anyone other than jenny powell aaw that's
i got away with a nice one there aaw
so on to the game then with the help of our magic keys our lovely lively house detective lisa snowden will make a forensic examination of houses belonging to two famous celebrities with the evidence she provides plus a bit of help from our friends in the studio audience all our panel have to do is just to work out whose homes they are so let's join lisa at house number one and watch closely because remember the clues are there as we go through the keyhole
i'm in gloucestershire and even on this misty autumn morning this is the most romantic setting i think you could ever find in england but before you even enter the house this decking and the furnishings on it make a positive statement there's a perfect dynamic about this isn't this a fabulous space i can't think of enough adjectives to describe it and if i started it would probably turn into a monologue beautiful panache is a good word this person likes to do things with bags of it but whilst it's a sexy place it's obviously a well lived in home i like the size of everything huge comfy sofas beautifully becushioned with throws casually draped over them it looks as though this has all happened through a happy accident but i can tell you this person is an expert when it comes to dressing things properly i just love the mixture of old and new this basket of pebbles wouldn't normally strike me as ornamental but set against these battered pieces of luggage it works really well this large coffee table edition of magnum with some of the world's best photographs in it style just pours out of this bedroom with this fabulous steel chair with roses cut out of it it might not be too comfy if you've just got out of the bath but this is very interesting how many bedrooms have grafitti on the wall looks like banksy's been here very cool if you're going to have a light have a big one this is certainly someone who's used to the limelight i'm ready for my close up mr. demille i don't know if you've noticed but there are certain items of ladies' apparel been left lying around i'm saying nothing i'll leave you to have a look i know they're fairly new to this magnificent home and haven't had time to hang everything but a few interesting posters waiting to take pride of place is this poster from the musical rent i don't think rent is a problem here this is a person who's very successful internationally canny and clever and certainly more than just a pretty face i believe this person is a bit of a deep thinker if these books are anything to go by the miracle of water look at this this is really interesting these were taken from water frozen when placed in four different glass containers with the words taped to the sides exhilaration dream peace love and gratitude so clever we also have deepak chopra the path to love the house of klein that's mr. calvin klein to you and i and a huge book on natural healing but if reading is just too hard then you could stare out at the lake for hours so let's take a look at the clues again luxury lingerie rent and the big pond who lives in a house like this david it's over to you
well thank you very much indeed lisa now for our studio audience and you at home but not for our panel here's whose house it is jennie we come to you what did you make of the home
i want to live there first of all it's absolutely gorgeous obviously the lingerie might be a bit of a giveaway a. n. n. summers do you reckon no probably a bit more upmarket janet reger don't know all right
what did you make of the house anton um
lingerie that's all
that was it that was it thank you very much
um it's it's very stylish it's obviously a lady it's obviously a female i was interested by a couple of things that lisa said was she made reference to a monologue which made me think it was somebody who has maybe modelled lingerie as opposed to designed lingerie shut up i'm on a roll don't stop me
i don't know whether they modelled but they certainly could model someone who i get the feeling from the property that somebody who's quite young young and flirty
flirty if you're hanging your knickers around the place
you must be quite flirty or just a bit messy yeah
have they been a performer in the west end
they have have they they have have they performed obviously across the big pond
yeah have they gone the other side
i don't know whether she's performed over there she hails originally from there but i don't know
jennie
we have a young attractive american lingerie lingerie
oh model designer i've got an idea
i don't understand how you got from monologue to the fact she might model
i tell you what i'm an enigma you are even i don't understand me sometimes
we got there that's the main point do any of you know about rent
yeah yes i never used to pay it
got evicted four times it was a nightmare
there's been a few celebrities i tell you
can i ask a question is she blonde yes what do you think i've no idea i think it's gotta be a model she's mostly a model is she yeah mostly a model
she's a model well you know and she's got her own line of lingerie
has she i didn't know that yeah
she has what do you think who's going to go for it
i think jenny should cos i'm not really sure
i think it's caprice you're right
it's caprice so caprice will you come through the keyhole lovely to see you fantastic thank you well done
well done yeah that was so fast
they loved the house didn't you
loved the house yeah what a house thank you
it's a really special place you don't really find anything like that here that's for sure in england thank you
do you dive in the water there
not now it's too darn cold but definitely in the summertime it's lovely and there's swans and ducks and it's really really a special place
the panel glommed on to it particularly when the thing came in about hailing from america at what age were you when you hailed from america
oh gosh i feel like i'm more european now i got here eleven years gosh i've been here eleven years now it's unbelievable i think this is where i'm going to spend the rest of my life good i love it i've been doing a lot of work in south africa as well but what i am doing now is the lingerie it's mostly here i started it here i still go back to america a little bit south africa germany
the lingerie that we saw was work rather than pleasure
i know everyone it started out as i was a lingerie model i did a license deal with the company and i thought my goodness are they making the cash'all or what so i kind of taught myself the ins and outs for three years and then bought back my license three years ago now so finally i'm working now i'm working twelve hour days i thought entertainment was hard that is nothing compared to this
you're right in there dealing with the designs and all of that
everything all the logisticals the factories the margins the cash flows the technical side at the end of the day when you're thrusting the majority of your money and you're paying for the bills you have a totally different kind of inspiration
and it is all your money
it's my money i don't have any investors i did this on my own
yes now i'm reaping the rewards the first few years i was a bit worried i thought was this the wrong idea was this a stupid idea now it's really paying off it's so rewarding this is something that could go on and on and on a model has a short shelf life you have to be realistic about that now i've started this company i'm doing the lingerie i just launched the swim i'm doing occasion wear i'm doing perfume i'm doing night wear so thank god it's going really well
you pick and choose and do some modelling do you do all your modelling now for your own products
my babe things have not gone bad yet i do all the modelling myself yeah if it does go bad i can just retouch it so so it's all good if you need a hand with the touching
i'll do it i'm glad to help that's so sweet my pleasure entirely i've got very soft hands you'll be fine
when you were doing that model look earlier on when you were guessing away it looked very elegant
yeah i have a swagger about me in a modellistic style
you would be perfect to model women's underwear i think so ooh i love that
i'll have a wax down it'll be fine a twist for you caprice
whatever floats your boat it's good
if it helps with the margins i'm your man oh i love him great
yes in the west end in the west end i'll never forget gosh i wanted actually the first night i almost peed my pants i was so nervous i was so nervous because the audience was full of journalists of course they wanted to absolutely slash me a model doing a credible production like rent and i was playing the lead and i was really nervous but the reviews thank god were really good
yeah really good they were you mentioned the press that's an interesting you take a rather things i've read realistic attitude in the sense that of course there's intrusion into privacy but basically that's what you're signing on for if you go into this business yeah
at the end of the day if you don't like it you could go into hibernation and they'll forget about you and they will they're that ruthless at the end of the day it's made me i'm from a normal middle class family now most of my family don't have passports and i live this unbelievable life and most of it is thanks to the press it's what thrusted me into the limelight it's what's made me my money and helped me to get to where i'm at today
so that's the price you have to be prepared to pay and not whinge about it
well no sometimes i do whinge about it yeah why not why not it makes good press right yeah yeah yeah
but i mean not all from what i read not all the stories about who you're romantically linked with have an iota of truth
can i tell you some of them i haven't even met yet i guess whatever sells they'll chuck it on the front page there have been some really hurtful stories that weren't true that did bother me but as time progresses you kind of develop a thick skin and you just say everyone will forget a week later they really do yeah so you take the good with the bad it's all good
can i tell you you are so true it's so true it really is you know what it's a very blessed and a privileged life i have to say
well you've earnt it
i'm so excited i've been waiting for this this is the magic moment
here it is coming your way now the through the keyhole key that says it's been great to have you with us
aw thank you caprice well done you guys i won't sell it on ebay too i'm keeping this
i wonder what it would be worth a beautiful business executive caprice now let's join lisa at house number two remember the clues are there as we go through the keyhole
mm interesting somebody a bit of a thinker i was just waiting for a bit of encouragement bit of a thinker thank you wait for the applause somebody who's not interested really in sort of much more than reading books playing chess
playing games
no interest to me whatsoever to be honest obviously doesn't like going shopping especially for food doesn't eat just reads reads a lot quite outspoken i think likes to be heard there you go likes his opinions heard
a good character study there over to you anton
it's obviously a man he spends i would say thank you he spends i just went with what lisa said but thanks for being impressed he spends a lot of time around i would say the houses of parliament and i would suggest his favourite colour might be yellow
i think that definitely must be
and potentially maybe a wee penchant for certain things cheeky
jennie
i think i know where he's going and it's a good direction i think this is quite a naughty slightly nutsy individual an eccentric a biker maybe likes flying after dinner speaking probably likes the sound of his own voice
that's a qualification if you're in politics that's right
yeah i think we're heading down the lib dem route
and the question is
he likes to be a little bit controversial sometimes if he can get away with it i think
the romanian dictionary was a bit of a giveaway see if someone like i might have heard of him because of those silly magazines where other people would have heard of him from reading the times and the telegraph he might have been in a few chatty gossipy magazines and things yes as well as being a political person
yes he has a public life in more senses of the word than one
mm
what about all this astronomy business
yes that's a bit wacky i think this person is wacky
maybe his head's in the clouds oh i like that
i think poet i think that astronomy stuff runs in the family
so we haven't got to guess what star sign he is as well have we
no but if you can get that you get a special bonus
ooh i think he's a sagittarius all right
we'll find out in a moment but can we find out first who is gonna say the name
i think it should be jennie yes
we wrote it down at the same time i don't know if you did jenny no we wrote lembit opik
and you were right hooray it's lembit opik so lembit opik will you come through the keyhole
well done
now in fact they got there very commandingly and quickly didn't they
it's a tremendous relief though i am pisces not sagittarius aww i was gonna say pisces
not bad it's almost the same talking almost the same not almost the same the dictionary there that was between english and romanian your background is estonian that's right not romanian does romania cover estonia for dictionaries
no i had to go to a specialist shop to get that one to play scrabble with my other half she basically uses that to improve her english and i use it to improve my romanian but unfortunately it's not the same as estonian at all it's not that english is spoken here and everyone else speaks foreign there are lots of different languages all across europe it's about one thousand five hundred miles apart between estonia and romania i spoke estonian before i spoke english when i went to school which wasn't too handy in northern ireland
but growing up in northern ireland the family's home language is estonian how did you deal with the transition
my parents knew that once i was old enough to go to school i'd learn english anyway so we spoke estonian until i was about four or five and then i went to school and i remember the first thing i noticed was what funny names everybody else had then i thought maybe lembit opik isn't as common as i thought when i was at home my sister actually had a bit more trouble with it but my brother fitted in perfectly we were about half of the entire estonian community of northern ireland at the time you were we got on with the other half quite well but we didn't see them very often
at the same time as our panel rightly said all forms of stars have been part of your life do you find the coverage of your private life becoming public is fun
first of all i thought it was really stressful because it's kind of a free for all in politics you get judged for your policies and your views if you do celebrity stuff you're judged as the person you are the personality the character that is more stressful but there's nothing we could do about it me and my partner actually i think we've come to enjoy it now it is a bit of fun i think it helps me reach people in the political world who aren't interested in politics the danger is you have to have a political narrative to do that if you lose the narrative you just become a b. list celebrity that's not really what my core business is it's about politics
what's your ambition
i suppose to save the world from asteroid impact once i've done that i can maybe campaign for civil liberties issues in politics that's really important to me that's why i guess i'm a liberal democrat outside politics i fly planes if i can do those two things i'll be a happy man
you were lucky once in a crash weren't you
yes i nearly got killed in nineteen ninety eight thirteenth of april when i was paragliding it's like a sort of parachute that you jump off a hill and you're meant to stay in the air but i didn't i fell about thirty metres broke my back in twelve places and i was a disaster of an accident smashed my ribs my sternum my jaw and the incredible thing is i had enough of a survival instinct to walk a mile with a broken back you're not meant to walk with a broken back but the choice was walk or die so in the end i walked to the car you'd have died the extent of the injuries was so great that
you had to get there quickly
we were nowhere near a hospital fourteen miles from the local hospital llanidloes in my constituency a small place then forty eight miles extra in an ambulance to get to shrewsbury hospital and they literally saved my life so it changes your state of mind about things it makes you relax more and enjoy the journey of life rather than always being focused on a particular destination
we're delighted you survived not as happy as i am we hope you continue to survive a the gossip columnists and b. the world of politics it's been a delight to have you with us thanks a lot
it's all been worth it for this
this is the truth the validation of the fact you were here
thank you very much indeed
we're twenty minutes from the bustle of central london in richmond upon thames welcome to flog it this area's jam packed with public houses it must be to do with today's venue the world famous twickenham stadium which dominates the skyline casting their eyes over all the unwanted antiques in these bags are the elite squad of experts david barby and philip serrell there's no time to waste and philip is already watching the clock
look at my hair that is brilliant
your hair is magnificent it's all different colours
it's dyed henna why do you do that i want my hair to look goldy like goldilocks or whoopi goldberg
whoopi there's a likeness
yeah i won a lookalike competition
how much did you win one hundred and some peanut butter where did you get this from this belonged to my late father in law
somebody gave it to him after the second world war this person used to run an antiques shop in twickenham after the war he packed up and wanted to go back to france
do you like it yes i like it
but it just sits and collects dust
it's a bit ritzy for me originally it would have sat underneath a large glass dome it's emblematic of the sciences we've got dividers here the globe we've got galileo newton it's really decorative isn't it
yes that's why i liked it but as you say the glass dome is missing
you can buy replacements
oh really i didn't know that
you can buy brand new glass domes yeah it isn't the best clock in the world there's damage to it in terms of date you're looking at the back end of the nineteenth century i'm assuming there's no maker's marks on the back
no no dates not that i know of it could be on the bottom
we'd have to take the dial off and see if there's any maker's mark the auction room will do that for us yes
if it's by a really good maker which i doubt it is but if it's by a good maker they'll put that in the catalogue and adjust the estimate
the thing about it is that it's actually a big piece you don't realise this sitting in this big hall you put that on a mantelpiece or table and it's a really imposing thing yes it is that might just hold it back in terms of value cos not everyone can accommodate it
a lot of people have big houses and high ceilings
yes that would look nice in the hallway they'll need to yes in terms of value i think at auction it'll make one hundred fifty to two hundred fifty that'll be my shot for it i'd like to put a reserve on it of about one hundred twenty five a fixed reserve i think that someone will buy it it's a good looking lot
yes it is it's a decorative lot it's quite nice happy with that yes fine i'm happy with it
so what will the two hundred do more hair extensions
i think if i get the money i've got a place in spain so i'll use it to do the place up with
good let's hope it does well
thank you very much i hope so too
sylvia i'm quite intrigued by this painting where did it come from were you born in the north i was born in london you were born in london where did you get the painting my aunt gave it to me fifty years ago right did she come from the north no she was born local so you're both london girls yes we were the reason i ask is because ernest dade is a well known northern artist so a lot of the subject matter like this sailing boat is of the north scarborough whitby robin hood bay that sort of area but he spent some time in chelsea so where did your aunt live
she lived at battersea ah well there we are
oh i see so your aunt acquired it from an auction
maybe at the time that dade had died it's this chelsea connection and your aunt at battersea which is so intriguing why on earth are you selling it
i want to do a bit of downsizing it doesn't go with my decor now
is it the large gilt frame that doesn't go
yes i think so and i'm downsizing it is big when people downsize
it is a big picture to go on the wall yes i like it and i think at auction there'll be a lot of interest i think it'll be over five hundred i'd like to see it go for something like one thousand two hundred
oh lovely
yes i think we should put the reserve at about seven hundred fifty lovely is that agreeable very agreeable
maureen thank you for bringing an item of furniture with you it's made my day you know i love wood yes what can you tell me about it well it's my sewing box how long have you had it
it was my grandmother's and my mother and then to me
it's been in the family three generations used as a sewing box it's not a sewing box we've seen only one other on the show before it's a tea poy you're probably wondering what a tea poy is
yes i am it's like a very large tea caddy on a stand
i didn't know what to do with it it always had sewing stuff in it with my mother and i just carried on yeah
this section would be for a glass mixing bowl yes so you could blend different fusions of tea each compartment if i lift one out this is a cuban mahogany which was very fashionable in the mid seventeen hundreds and this is a rosewood also imported from the west indies which became very fashionable in the early eighteen hundreds all this is a veneer it's stuck on to the mahogany look you can see a little two millimetres there yes that's rosewood isn't it decorative it's got that striking grain of blacks oranges and yellows if you open up one of those sections it would have been lined with tin foil can you see traces of it
yes and you can see it in there in there
that kept all the tea fresh so you'd have black tea in there as one blend possibly you'd have green tea in this one and you could mix your own blend and have another compartment for your mixture
very interesting absolutely stunning
even though it's in appalling condition was it always like this
ever since i can well this piece at the side that came off
the veneer you've got the section i've got it it's always been kept that can be put back on easily by a restorer we thought about it
then remembered somebody said don't do it leave it
leave it alone look at the striking architectural proportions it's got lovely curvetto sides see this waisted side
yes it just softens the look doesn't it oh yes
the whole box is supported by this column the pedestal base which tapers at the top and is rocking down by the acanthus leaves yes one thing that someone's done is put this on i don't know where it's from that is a flower motif from a panel or something that shouldn't be there who did that if it's been in your family all your life i've no idea no it's always been like that have you any idea of its value
not a clue if i said three hundred to four hundred would that surprise you um no not really i mean it is old and it's nice yeah
happy to flog it three hundred to four hundred and let's hope it does the four hundred fifty mark we'll put a fixed reserve of three hundred cos we don't want to give it away
yeah let's do it then let's flog it right
patrick this is a really nice bit of doulton how did you come by it
i started collecting about thirty years ago i lived in edinburgh then just above an auction room probably where i bought this
so you bought this thirty years ago yes how much for
about can't have been more than seventy five quid i would think
it's doulton the impress mark's here it's quite early about one thousand eight hundred seventy two one thousand eight hundred seventy five something like that it's salt glazed stoneware which gives it this orange peel effect this is sgraffito decoration a wooden spatula would be scratched into the clay when it was green or not quite set and you get this incised decoration the name that springs to mind is
hannah barlow hannah barlow
i'm not sure that's quite good enough for hannah barlow could be her sister florence barlow so what we'll say is it's a royal doulton salt glazed stoneware flagon decorated with rabbits or hares attributed to barlow and we'll leave it at barlow if the auction room want to put hannah or florence barlow that's up to them it wants an illustration in the catalogue whether it might have had a silver collar at some time is debatable it makes you wonder stylistically you have the hares here and at the back is this foliage i just wonder whether they're both by the same hand
yes they may be by different hands
the other thing that's interesting is the decoration on the base which is sort of browns and blues almost and i wonder whether this is perhaps an early experimental piece because this is not uniform all the way round here you clearly don't collect doulton any more i don't have you moved on to other collecting spheres
lloyd loom lloyd loom sad isn't it
you need to get out more how the hell have you gone from this to lloyd loom
i don't know i've got more modern
the thing we associate with lloyd loom are the corner linen baskets
linen baskets chairs ottomans ottomans and chairs
will this be a star bit of lloyd loom if it sells no
it's my thirty fifth wedding anniversary coming up so i'm collecting for that that's normally jewellery i think
sounds like you've got problems
let's get straight to the auction action and see if we can find a bidder for etha's clock whoever buys it will need a large mantelpiece sylvia's maritime masterpiece should sail away maureen's tea poy needs t. l. c. but it's still a quality item and patrick's royal doulton jug i hope it sells well so he and his wife can celebrate in style today we've nipped down to the chiswick auction rooms the man in charge of the gavel who'll give us the hammer action is auctioneer tom keane right lot number one hundred thirty six this lot has the lot quality condition and a great maker's name royal doulton it belongs to patrick and we've got a valuation of two hundred to three hundred fixed reserve at one hundred eighty should be fine it should bust it it should do it's almost hannah barlow
it's stylish enough got everything going for it i think it'll go a bit better so do i hopefully three hundred three hundred fifty that sort of mark yes it's a nice tall vessel as well
it's decorative it stands well by itself so i'm hoping for three hundred eighty on that i've seen them do that before
it's got every chance fingers crossed
cloud detail is good dutch influence it's good
fingers crossed we need movement right now
this is it good luck

i do you don't want to take it home not really
unfortunately you have to today or they'll charge you storage take it with you today to save a trip back to the sale room but there are other auction rooms and i suggest maybe a maritime sale or a fine art sale because we're in a general sale here it didn't find the bidders did it no time is ticking away for etha for her french clock that is and because you're leaving the country etha's flying off to spain for a new life tell us about that

maureen and i have pulled a seat up cos it's getting hot and the tension's getting to us it's very exciting with lots of highs and lows i'm hoping the next lot will be the high because it's my valuation it's the tea poy and we need three hundred to four hundred condition's against it but it should just do it it's a good restoration project
let's hope i'm sure whoever buys it won't keep their sewing stuff in it i've got all my cottons in a plastic box now

thank you so much for coming in that's all right if you want to invest in antiques invest in quality a good maker's name in good condition this lot has got the lot it's royal doulton and belongs to patrick why are you flogging this then
um i've sort of lost interest in it and i need to get some money for something else
it should do well it's decorative it's the thing of the moment you've got to keep your fingers crossed that one or two people that want it are here today
i think they just might be we had a chat to the auctioneer earlier you don't know this nor does philip he loves it he says it's got the look got the touch condition everything is going for it even the rabbits on it he thinks it could do the three hundred to four hundred so we're looking at the top end

two hundred eighty that's a sold sound brilliant that'll do the business for you
fantastic thank you for coming in
philip great estimate i'm very pleased with that this is syon house nestling on the river thames the london home of the percy family earls and dukes of northumberland for the last four hundred years all of those generations have contributed to the house w. e. see today a culmination of a series of conversions to the original tudor mansion but sir hugh smithson the first duke of northumberland possibly had the greatest impact on the house inheriting the estate in one thousand seven hundred fifty he commissioned the scottish architect robert adam to redesign the interiors instructing him to create an opulent palace of greco roman splendour presumably money was no object because the resulting designs are some of the most striking neo classical designs you'll find anywhere else in the country just look at this your eyes gravitate up towards the heavens it's marvellous it's splendid it's so hard to take it all in your eyes vying for attention every surface is covered just back from his grand tour of italy robert adam's head was full of all the greek and roman statues he'd seen on his travels borrowing all these classical symbols of wealth power and antiquity he repackaged the whole lot for his client joining me to take a look at robert adam's work here is architectural historian christopher woodward thanks for joining us hello good to see you this has the wow factor this entrance hall
what's amazing is you walk up to this jacobean facade this english exterior and you step through that door ancient rome wow
it's quite austere outside but inside it's just true theatre tell me about the owners of the house
it's the first duke of northumberland but his wife's house and her money she had a brother who died on the grand tour this is the percy family so there were no men left she married a young baronet sir hugh smithson and they spent lavishly they lived lavishly they lived and spent more grandly than king george the third and his family
how did robert adam get the commission
robert adam is a genius a brilliant scottish architect he goes to rome and he writes home i'll be wasted on scotland he decides to conquer london so he comes back and he opens an office in mayfair with a team of italian artists who work for him that he brought back there's sculpture and paintings on the walls and he has his sketches of rome
on that journey he persuades you that he better than anyone else
can conjure up for you the true spirit of roman antiquity here their british architect james payne has never been to rome and they kick him off and give adam the job adam had a vision yes shall we go on a tour of adam's work throughout the house this is the anteroom wow gosh it's a kaleidoscope of colour
what was this room used for
the duke is a statesman a man of power this is where you waited to see him
shuffling around making you feel very insecure it does show off his wealth was ancient rome as bright as this that's what robert adam believed
he's saying this is how roman architecture was this is how they lived he created this gaudy brilliant interior the statues of roman gods and goddesses are modern replicas they're plaster covered in gilding what i love what's real is the columns because romans loved marble they were connoisseurs of different colours and patterns of marble these are single pieces of marble quarried in egypt floated down the nile across the sea to rome where the boat sank they were buried in the mud of the tiber for two thousand years someone found them and they were brought to syon house so this is not just a house imitating rome these columns are real roman architecture
why was the family trying to copy the roman way of life what was it about the romans
britain saw itself as the new rome the one thousand seven hundred sixties is when britain has beaten the french in the seven years war
there's a feel good factor yes very confident we have an empire the richest country in the world
it really is splendid shall we see some more next is the quieter dining room another demonstration of adam's skill in expanding a small space to create a larger one by means of niches screens and perspective gosh now this looks altogether a lot more feminine
yes this is for the women to withdraw to after dinner
look at the ceiling
what a talented artist i absolutely love the woven silk on the walls i love that faded look in its day it would have been a very bright red was that imported from france
the duke wanted to but because of the war with the french he wanted the most fashionable silk hangings so he had weavers in spitalfields copy it for him
gosh really well they've done a fine job haven't they
you have to imagine this room without the pictures and also imagine it by candlelight this was an evening room the duchess was famous for the candles she burned the duke was very proud of those two pier glasses they were made in paris they cost more than four hundred they were two of the biggest mirrored glasses anyone had seen in britain and you had to get it from france
they are big
robert adam's ability is to design a room knowing it will be lit by candlelight what you see in this room is just how much expense they'd go to to get every detail right when you come to the doorway you have these gilt and ormolu details set against panels of ivory the attention to detail is spot on
now this is typical of a tudor long gallery where people took their exercise on a rainy day but he's taken it and remodelled the whole thing
he's created a new classical interior in the existing space what i think it shows you about adam is that he designs everything down to the doorknobs he is one of the first architects to do the house interior and furniture
you get the whole package with him yes and he showed here that
when you think about roman interiors don't think temples and monuments he'd looked at these baths and private houses they'd dug up with this light gentle easy going ornamentation exactly what you also get with adam is a team so one artist he'd brought from italy painted the portraits i see
these are all family portraits yes the ancestry of the percy family
a second artist painted scenes of ancient rome landscapes architecture and a third artist michelangelo pergolesi painted the walls with these delicate arabesque patterns he so liked the duke was so pleased with his work he gave him a twenty tip
gosh that was a lot of money in those days thank you very much for showing me around if anybody wants any tips on how to make their house look like robert adam's they should visit syon park thank you it's time to get back to the valuation day and see what items our experts have set their sights on david has certainly got something brewing
carol who was the irish member of your family
all my family all your family's irish yes
you haven't got an irish accent i was born over here
but all my family are irish and that's where this came from
that's interesting because this is belleek porcelain which was produced in northern ireland in fermanagh how did you acquire it has it been passed down
it belonged to my aunt and she left it to me she was a single lady so had no children of her own um the story is that it was given to her when she was a young girl
really now what i like about this
is the northern ireland association with the sea so here is this wonderful teapot which is in the form of an urchin so we've got this lovely sort of bulbous shape with the markings of an urchin shell then the actual handle is the fall of coral even the spout has coral decoration on it now when you look at belleek because it's such a fine porcelain you look for damage inevitably pieces get damaged they're quite famous for those delicate baskets yes it's difficult lifting that out because of the smooth glaze looking at this little finial in the form of a shell it's slightly damaged there i don't think that will go against it too much we'll take that into account i'll leave that there and turn it upside down to look at the mark the mark is somewhat rubbed see that with belleek underneath that's the mark for early belleek count of fermanagh would be later
right this is a black trademark so it's quite an early piece
so carol why are you selling it no one in the family wants it
i've got two sons but they're not interested in having it so if somebody would like it who collects and would appreciate it like that
well this is a nice collector's piece but it's so very fine and susceptible to damage bearing that in mind and that element of damage we've got to fix a price i think the auctioneer will probably say somewhere between two hundred forty and three hundred that sort of price range allowing for the damage we've got to tuck in under that figure so i think we'll be seeking a reserve of about two hundred twenty five
right how does that sound yes i'll be quite happy with that yes
there's a slight hesitation we all like to think it'll be more valuable that's true peter what can you tell me
not much i found it in my mother's house when i was clearing it out till then i didn't even know it existed
let's look at the obvious things first it's got recessed handles either side which pull out when they're recessed it makes you think it's a travelling case as opposed to a box that would sit on a side table so it's a travelling box it's victorian coromandel or calamander wood it's got cut brass inlay here and here's a name plate for lady dickenson when we open it up what do we find open it up wow look at that isn't that lovely so this then falls forward there's a stationery pouch behind that you can see here where the stationery drops in we'll take one of these out it's a little glass perhaps soap container there you can see there are hallmarks on the inside of the lid they date to one thousand eight hundred fifty two victoria came to the throne in one thousand eight hundred thirty seven so she'd been around for what fifteen twenty years by the time this was made if we now drop the flap down you can see again recessed hinges one might be a jewellery drawer one might have a writing slope in it let's have a look so there we are a little jewellery box or jewellery drawer and another one with a lift out tray i think it's a lovely thing push that down value what do you think it's worth
i honestly have no idea well
there are minor problems there are some scratches here which a good cabinet maker can sort out but you have got a fairly healthy split along the top but it's a good quality box i would estimate that at auction at two hundred to four hundred
as much as that yeah
i'd put a reserve on it of about one hundred sixty one hundred eighty i think it'll do well what will you do with the funds
as i say my mother died about five weeks ago and i want to get a memorial to put at the crematorium for her
that's going to go to a really good cause i hope it does really well thanks for bringing it no problem babs how many years ago did you buy this thirty years ago thirty years you've been married thirty years thirty three years yes was it a wedding present a late one
sort of one treated ourselves yes very nice
did you actually go to the troika shop yes at saint ives
yes saint ives down the little street and what was it like oh i remember there was a window and a lot of glass and other things shelves and things around
oh even the glazes are more controlled on this one
than the earlier so this is an object that i don't think was intended to hold flowers this was always intended as an object to admire handle but not necessarily in a utilitarian manner right it's very nice how much did you pay
i think it was about eight pounds about eight pounds
well that was a good investment actually if this goes up for auction we're looking at round about sixty eighty
oh maybe a little bit more really so quite a good investment
my era your era what else can you associate with that era music what was the music of the time lively much better than it is today
i don't know we haven't thought about it yet
a familiar mix of lots for our final section of today's auction carol's belleek teapot is a fine example but there's some damage peter's vanity box is a bit tired they used to make great money and finally barbara's brought in an old friend troika but there are no guarantees at auction it's time for tea but don't go and put the kettle on we have a teapot up for grabs it belongs to carol this is lovely an urchin teapot which david put a valuation on we're looking for two hundred fifty hopefully three hundred fifty it's got the quality it's got the look
it's so early the early stamp i love the way they feature the sea
yes all the creatures the urchin is a very early shape gorgeous
something for belleek collectors and for teapot collectors you heard what david said i think it'll do its money i'm with david i chatted with the auctioneer earlier he said it might struggle
well it might just get the bottom end
fingers crossed though we're here to prove him wrong we want the top end don't we yes that would be nice why flog it well it's been in the family a long time
but my sons aren't interested in it i suppose not if somebody that collects likes it it's a family heirloom it's a shame
the belleek teapot start me please for one hundred one hundred for it i'll take one hundred ten one hundred i'm bid i'll take one hundred ten who'll give me one hundred ten one hundred twenty there one hundred thirty one hundred forty one hundred fifty one hundred sixty one hundred fifty's bid the bid's at one hundred fifty take one hundred sixty at one hundred fifty all done and finished at one hundred fifty should make more than this at one hundred fifty no further interest anyone one hundred sixty we're gonna finish at one hundred fifty
that's auctions for you i'm not worried is it going home definitely i think it's a lucky omen you've had it a long time i do miss it
i miss looking at it there you go i'll take it home i'm not disappointed it was a day out
or try it in a specialist ceramic sale that's the answer it's a good sale room but a general sale i think we're keeping it
a nineteenth century brass and inlaid wood fitted vanity box number two hundred ninety two it has a fitted interior all singing and all dancing start me at one hundred see where it goes i'm bid one hundred first bid of one hundred are you one hundred ten one hundred ten i'm bid one hundred twenty one hundred thirty one hundred forty one hundred fifty one hundred sixty one hundred seventy one hundred sixty you bid take one hundred seventy one hundred seventy one hundred eighty one hundred ninety two hundred

would you like to go back there
especially on a hot day like this after an auction
you can come with me
hey everybody how you doing that's what we like thank you very much indeed ah hello good afternoon welcome to ready steady cook great food coming your way in a matter of minutes with food that the chefs have never seen before let's welcome them and our guests first up in the red kitchen we have chef james tanner joined by former world rugby champion matt dawson and joining chef nick nairn in the green kitchen yeah we used to see him sprinting down that track it can only be the one and only roger black got out of that one all right how are you doing you like that ah dear oh masterchef champion do you feel walking on to this show you have every right to be a winner straight off
no way no way we had to graft hard both myself and roger had to work very very hard it was brilliant though always nice to win
actually this is pretty much what i would find in my fridge regularly parma ham i would use that rather than bacon and mix it with loads of other bits and pieces
yeah i'm allowed to eat loads of steak now that i'm retired so it's something you literally had to avoid always
er not totally but it would be more chicken fish rather than
take too long to digest that
that's very true this is my vice that is my vice cambozola it is my vice
it's a pretty mean cheese oh a bit late night
desserts no cheese yes lovely and some chestnut mushrooms there you go mushrooms rice broccoli and the old banana shallot
how much did you spend then matt
ten point oh four
oh it's a little bit over but he's a champion we're not going to argue with him are we ladies and gentlemen oh no come on then chef tell us what you think of that brilliant bag
did i try and pad that out long enough for you no no that's good
yeah my brain's ticking over
what we're going to do is we're going to take some of the cheese take some of the mushrooms we're going to do something called a mushroom duxelle where we sweat it off with the shallots and garlic we blitz them up we're going to add the cheese i was going to do the steak with a cheese crust but i'm going to go for it and do a beef wellington so wrap it in some pastry we'll make some pastry and do a beef wellington we can do obviously a nice side of rice incorporating the broccoli the rest of the mushrooms some of the parma ham will be used to wrap around the steak so it doesn't bleed into the pastry all will be explained we'll do a nice broccoli salad with crispy parma ham as well and we'll
leave it for now there's about twelve items there ladies and gentlemen
i've got the feeling i am going to be involved yes you are
we want you to make your own dish both you and roger for the moment though ladies and gentleman let's hear it for matt and james how are you doing very well how are you feeling about the challenge today
i'm good but dawson was quite impressive on masterchef so this is my chance for revenge and it is sweet it will be sweet
come on then without hesitation let's have a look at those ingredients
a bit of apricots and pine nut kernels because my wife likes it she always says to me chuck that in the food and i never really know what it can go with and what it can't
my wife says the same thing i end up putting them in the salad a bit of a nutty experience in my house just like you roger absolutely how much did you spend
well i went a little bit higher actually i went ten point one oh ah
but look at those ingredients look at the lamb
what do you think then chef these are fantastic ingredients
what we're going to do we'll take some of the chops off these and we'll cook them with a little crust a nice crunchy herby crust made with pine nuts the rest as a rack of lamb and one of the best things with rack of lamb is a gratin dauphinoise thinly sliced potato instead of using garlic to flavour it we'll use lemon zest go with me on this one we'll do a really nice red wine gravy we'll chargrill some of the asparagus and do it with a nice poached egg and a little hollandaise on there i think we'll poach these apricots in a cardamom scented syrup and we'll make little citrus mousse to go with them as well and
they are seriously sweating over there
fillet steak really nice i'll get this on as quickly as possible i am going to sear off the fillet and i'm going to trim it up and incorporate a little bit of it into a salad like i said with the crispy parma ham i'm going to flatten it out slightly lovely marbling of fat through it lovely
is that what people should look for definitely
but with fillet steak it doesn't have to be as aged as much as an entrecote or sirloin steak so when you see twenty eight day steaks it's not usually fillet that's that long
all right that means it will break down too much
think about that when you're buying fillet steak when you go to the butchers even supermarkets now have got aged meat have a think about that
matt at your butcher's or do you buy your meat from a supermarket
no definitely the butcher's fishmonger's market for veg
has it always been that way
it's one of the things i've learned from the show the quality is
paramount absolutely
it can make a huge difference to the way your food tastes fantastic
i am going to rub in the fat the butter we're going to bind it with an egg i need quite a taut pastry because i don't want the steak to bleed out into it so first we rub the two ingredients together
yeah if i can get this machine working
always butter or any time you'd use olive oil instead
you can do but if i used olive oil in this one it's a bit greasy it will react with the steak and the fat from parma ham so i wouldn't
he's doing broccoli he's cutting mushrooms because i need them
sorry i tell you what your breadcrumbs are there chef
what we have done we've just taken off the chops here three chops what we'll do with the rack is roast it just dry pan skin side down a bit of seasoning a bit of salt and a bit of pepper in there once the fats start to run it'll go in the oven it'll take eight minutes to cook out in here we've got half milk half cream salt pepper roger's just zested the zest of one lemon in here as that comes up to the boil i'm just putting thinly sliced potatoes you don't actually have to peel the potatoes for gratin dauphinoise
goodness is only skin deep i'll tell you something about gratin
yeah yeah yeah i'll tell something about gratin dauphinoise in a lot of recipes we tell you to wash the potatoes to take the starch off the outside all you do then is you lose the thing that's going to thicken this up which is the starch
and glue it together so you must leave them nice and starchy
the starch will thicken it and hold it together
roger are you picking up any tips here mate are you eavesdropping on this
yes well actually i was just doing this a fab job over there
and a little bit more
four minutes gone gentlemen
and there is no cheese in gratin dauphinoise either in this one in this gratin here instead of using garlic we've used the lemon zest which is going to add a citrus thing in to the lamb dish
and other things you could put in can you infuse a little herb in there a robust herb
sorry put them into this chargrill pan do i season them now or in there season them in there
lovely now roger there we are the final of masterchef i know
talk about pressure i tell you i know what is more pressure
lining up in the olympics to run that has six hundred metres or that four hundred metres
six hundred metres would be good
or getting involved in masterchef just being in the final
well i knew i was good at running and that is what i did but cooking it was completely different and i have never it's the hardest thing i've ever done on television masterchef because the worst thing is actually the first round not the final it gets easier as you go along because you walk into this studio and there are these mystery ingredients and you have fifty minutes or whatever to come up with a two course meal which you'll be judged on i had nightmares about that oh it was awful why did you actually do it because i love a challenge i wanted to become a better cook and it worked but it was just the challenge of doing something out of your comfort zone and i think everyone wants to be able to cook better and to have the chance to be around these great chefs and to have the experience was fantastic
what are you most proud of just throw them all in drop them all in at once that's it give that pan a shake that's lovely what recipe were you most proud of oh my piece de resistance was a lemon souffle which worked
because you either get it right or you get it wrong and it came out of the oven and it was that perfect that was my moment that was my moment
nick have you got a recipe you are particularly proud of nick
i don't think there's one that particularly stands out ains i think the thing i am really proud of is developing a style of produce based cooking i need to get his man to do something take these apricots half of them chop them into quarters and the other half we'll make a sugar syrup in here so i'm going to get a little bit of caster sugar
this is going to be the cardamom syrup equal quantities of dry white wine cardamom sugar
sorry chef quarters like that perfect yep
did you hear that sorry chef he is getting into the kitchen mode he's right in the zone
cardamom seeds in here
cardamom pods there chef they're there are they not there straight ahead that one that's it
cardamom pods a great substitute if you want to use nutmeg or something like that crush some cardamom pods they are wonderfully aromatic guys lots of lovely ideas going here don't forget we've got a website with today's recipes it feels a bit like a masterchef moment doesn't it we'll get back and see them later let's get back to that fillet wellington
a small knife chef thank you there you go
soup a little bit of broccoli use the stalks cos that's good you're not wasting anything use the stalk some onion some garlic a little bit of vegetable stock this is your own creation is it er well yeah you know you've got to give it a go haven't you
absolutely we love that he gives it a go that's what we want on this show here we are now matt doing masterchef has it improved your skills are you a better cook better at creating dishes and experimenting
you get the bit between your teeth does masterchef help you get to that stage then
masterchef taught me about my palate if anything there were loads of dishes that i enjoyed doing it was understanding what food goes with what how that reacts in your mouth and how you can understand if it needs a little bit more salt or does it need more sugar so it's changed your taste a bit yeah
it's kind of adjusted things a little bit and getting to the final with yet another top sportsman is part of it that competitive edge or just love of food
it was a bit beyond that it was about i've got to find this grill pan it was about being competitive with yourself it was about being competitive with yourself of course all of us wanted to win yeah but i wasn't competitive against roger i don't think roger was competitive against me we competed against ourselves
you were focussing on it we were into something we were getting passionate about
i wanted to be better and better and better i'm never gonna be a great chef there was a life skill a little bit like the dancing it's one of those things you can always then do
are you still talking to mark ramprakash of course i am yeah look at that face it said it all
anyone who can move his hips like that deserves to win believe me
he's a sweet mover do you remember that yeah the ladies remember it i don't know about the gentlemen i don't know about that chef tell us what's going on here
flat leafed parsley sauteed mushrooms can i move that yeah that can come off now the rice that we cooked down in the stock mix it all up season it up and this will make a wonderful perfumed side order
and the pine nuts are going in there
yeah have you ever prepared this for the wife no i haven't i usually just throw them over
this is a new pine nut recipe then this is why i chose it that's fantastic who's the main cook you or the missus
definitely me yeah yeah we've a busy life at the moment we've got two year old twin boys
they're twin boys aren't they yeah
so i do all the cooking at the moment
what sort of things are you cooking for them
i don't think we should be gourmet all the time they like their fish fingers yeah
and sweet potato just mashed up do you want me to spin this yeah please sweet potato pureed up fantastic they love carrots fresh chopped mint they love chicken pretty basic give that a spin round
it might need a bit more olive oil
like matt doing masterchef changed the way i saw cooking cos i'm not scared of cooking any more when you're immersed in it for a few weeks you pick up so much so quickly i'm not scared of it i think it's great
what gave you more satisfaction getting through to the final achieving what you did or having that olympic medal
well it's a tight one but it still has to be the olympic medal
yeah that's what i wanted you to say that's what i wanted you to say
nothing's the same as standing on the olympic rostrum you can't you should try it it's great
what's happening in the future business things happening for you i've got a fitness company
which sells treadmills and bikes to try and keep the nation healthy i do corporate speaking and bit and pieces but really it's changing a lot of nappies and being at home
it is as long as the wellington cooks through in time which i think it will do how long have we got about three minutes i'll take the wellington out and leave it to rest for a bit
we're just melt it up with a bit of butter use the heat of the pan that'll add a lovely richness and gloss to it we've got sauteed off beef with a bit of balsamic a bit of broccoli we've got an egg on the way
we've got rice pudding matt's segmenting oranges to garnish it
beautiful
your soup matt i'll grab that soup
lovely what type of soup chef
i haven't tasted that actually you might need to go for it
isn't that an interesting thing there ladies and gentlemen i haven't tasted it yet how many times do we look at recipes and books and stuff and pop it out taste is the most important thing before you serve
certainly is it makes a big big difference what's coming up matt what are you doing next i've been with the b. b. c. working on the rugby the six nations and they're touring in the summer down to new zealand
do you miss the rugby do you miss that competitive sort of thing i'm so so fortunate
when i work with five live i've got two great commentators former players and i sit on the halfway line at twickenham wow in the best seat two minutes it's just magnificent i feel like i'm really still part of it yeah but i'm not getting my head kicked in at the weekend as well oh no we've got to go down there
roger black i've got to ask you roger yep do you miss that competitive element do you want to get out there
no no chance it's too hard ainsley matt'll tell you it's too hard at the top we were lucky you end at the top and move on with the rest of your life let the younger ones do it
quick quick quick come on we've really got to go
on here yeah yeah yeah on the top watch your legs
fifty seconds get the rice pudding as soon as you've done that please
this on the top yeah
forty seconds what does it go into
it's gonna go into a long
put it in there
on top onto there yeah yes let's go
then pour this in at the same time
so we've got some broccoli sauteed down with some fillet steak a nice soft poached egg some of the cheese crispened up the parma ham a dry pan just makes for a nice salad a touch of balsamic on with the broccoli as well for a bit of tartness as well
if you had those things in your wardrobe wardrobe if you had those things in your wardrobe you shouldn't cook it it's probably out of date
so also got some mushrooms in it but the rest of mushrooms are split into another two dishes here we've got the rice flat leaf parsley mushrooms bit of butter in there as well flat leaf parsley works well with it parma harm on the top am i doing well you're doing fantastic
what about the old beef wellie get stuck in there here we go
like i said nice and pink and we've got in there the cheese we wrapped the beef after sealing it in parma ham put in blitzed up mushrooms with a bit of garlic in there bit of shallot in there cooked that down and then literally straight for it look
oh goodness me you've got to appreciate how difficult that's to do in twenty minutes that's unbelievable by the way
yeah that's unbelievable the competitive element is once again coming out in matt dawson of course we've got matt's soup we used chicken stock for this onion garlic we used the stalk of the broccoli because we didn't want to waste any of it cook it down with a little bit of water you have a taste tastes great because i seasoned it it's very nice very fresh flavour cheese croutons cheese and broccoli goes very well with the rest of the rice we cooked it out in the milk some cream some vanilla no sugar because i used honey we cooked it down with all of that the black flecks are the vanilla seeds matt finished it off with some oranges bit of orange juice in there as well
just look at that face ladies and gentlemen james and matt
my mum couldn't do any better
are you ready for this we're fine yes this looks like it needs to be eaten pick up your cutlery
that is food worthy for the first round this is final food look what he's done here food is about not just what it tastes like but what it looks like isn't that beautiful
you've got to pick it up with your fingers that type of stuff look how beautifully that's cooked dip that in your red wine jus
so this one rack of lamb roasted it season it well into the oven and we cooked it out roger made this crust with pine nuts herbs we used parsley basil garlic bit of breadcrumbs lot's of pine nuts you get a real crunch to that
that is nice very nice sweet as well it has some sweetness
would you eat that with the lemon dauphinoise potatoes
chargrilled carrots in there as well it's got lemon in it you say yeah so it's a much more refreshing flavour than you'd normally get with garlic the lime has a sweetness to it you get the lemon as soon as you put it into your mouth there's no juice in there just the zest
i've never had lemon in dauphinoise there's a first time for everything
and there's the sweetness of the carrots the sweetness of the line the sweetness of the carrots the lemon zest in here chargrilled he peeled the asparagus cut the egg gotta cut the egg haven't you go for the heads of the asparagus
that's fantastic the hollandaise two egg yolks
a teaspoon of mustard juice of half a lemon half a pack of butter whooshed it all up together chargrilled asparagus really brings the flavour out usually you have poached egg on asparagus don't you
that's different it's interesting
i think the fried egg really makes it just pick one just spices mixed spice on the outside pan fried those and left them to rest roasted the carrots with cumin cumin and carrots have a natural affinity we made this sauce
i've got to be the umpire impartial but it is fantastic
apricots mint pine nuts white wine and chicken stock
i'm going to let you get on with the dessert let's hear it for roger and nick
a difficult one today you know that at home just by looking at the quality of the food what will our audience decide to go for is it going to be a red kitchen win with matt and james or a green kitchen win with roger and nick the choice ladies and gentlemen is yours please pick up those keypads because i'd like you all to vote now are you in a lamb mood this afternoon or do you fancy a bit of beef who has won today's twenty minute challenge you can see it's a red kitchen win he's done it again there's your ready steady cook winner's plate of course we'd like to make a donation to your charity which is would you that's fantastic it's to be beat bowel cancer but i think it's only fair we should split it
that's really generous of you what's your charity
mine would be the phylis topwell hospice down in surrey
thank you very much well done to you too you're used to holding things aloft normally you're gripping an olympic medal
i came second there as well
you can always remember us with your ready steady cook mug yeah well done nick thank you very much
how did that feel yeah let's hear it for him what happens next year what you get out of that
i've just finished a month with heston blumenthal me and graham are helping to find talent for two thousand nine in canada and two thousand eleven when it comes to london
and you've also been doing some work at claridges haven't you
i've worked there for seven years so that's good they helped me with my training to get to japan and also they're helping other people
we're very proud of both of you guys keep it up you can always rely on brain he's very encouraging for the youth cooks in this country before i go brian what do you think of what these guys are doing
the one thing that they didn't mention his it's not only the skill that's important you've got to have mental strength physical strength you travel away from home a foreign country a strange atmosphere and what it takes out of those people when will did well it's a fantastic feeling these guys are heroes lots of people should have a go it's a great breeding ground for talent in this country thank you very much
we take the filo pastry and we could do deep fried strawberry samosas with a chocolate sauce while we're melting the chocolate incorporate the hazelnut cos i love chocolate and hazelnut mousse we can incorporate that into kind of like a fool but using the pineapple with the rest of the pineapple pineapple lime and chilli carpaccio with the rest of it all incorporating the ice cream you could do a baked alaska tart but using as a base the filo pastry
chargrilled pineapple with caramel sauce and toasted hazelnuts ice cream with poached strawberries and raspberries sauce little tricorns which is pretty much the same thing as the samosas stuffed with raspberries with a strawberry sauce and a chocolate mousse instead of the hazelnuts make some praline to go with that chocolate mousse with praline
i need to get some strawberry samosas on the go please ainsley get a couple of pans up brilliant i want to cut the pineapple
here we are nice big pineapple thank you
nick you're gonna take some of this pineapple i'm gonna use a bit for carpaccio just quickly take off the husk
tell us about that pineapple slightly unusual is it
yeah it is it's quite ripe now actually obviously not as dark yellow as you usually get and also the shape is more like a rugby ball isn't it
it does a little bit matt would be happy very nice just taking off the husk
i am just going to melt some chocolate quickly in the pan be really careful to make sure it doesn't burn i'm just going to melt some sugar so it tastes of caramel i'll use the hazelnuts to make a bit of praline
lovely
i'm going to serve the fruit alaska ainsley in the pan i think would be best i'll get a small non stick pan this one's quite nice and deep i'm going to nick some of this can i take this
yeah you can take what you want i'm just making up your little filo triangles
i'm just going to scrunch up the filo because it does cook exceptionally quickly basically give it so it has got an edge so there's something for the fruit to sit into then nick is going to do a meringue to finish it off over the top and we'll serve it in the pan
now guys most of us normally associate filo pastry with melted butter because that is the way that the greeks traditionally do it i'm using a bit of egg wash here because we want a tight seal because we'll be putting it into oil sometimes the butter can separate and the edges of the pastry can curl up we're trying to avoid that hence doing it this way a bit of sliced strawberry going in here all right then
right so get myself some limes
it was but i've changed my mind do you want it yeah i'll have it
have you got a bit of sauce to go with this
i'm going to do some raspberry sauce ainsley
chefs we all know that delia who we respect and love four point five minutes has now got a new book out and a new television series all about cheating do you actually think she's doing the right thing and would you actually eat frozen mashed potato at home or anywhere
thank you very much indeed chef brian turner gentleman
that's what you call a poisoned chalice i'm not a huge fan of frozen mashed potato but i do cheat i wouldn't call it cheating but i use things like convenience ingredients like filo pastry like canned chickpeas but some of that stuff using cartons of ready made meals to make and dress it up as something else i don't think is consistent with some of the messages we are trying to get out as professional chefs and some of the messages delia has been giving out over the years it goes against the grain but i can kind of understand where she is coming from but in terms of people have short time and want to do things as quickly as possible but there is a kind of limit as to how far you go that is as much as i'm going to say
yeah he's right no i mean the hard thing is you're asking us and as you know we're cooks we're very passionate about food and take it very seriously as nick said for years i grew up watching her teaching me how to cook my mum has got all her books and stuff like that i think part of it has been aimed at the market for people who are working longer hours and their lifestyles but personally i wouldn't get packet mashed potato and warm it up not when i can cut up a nice king edward potato put it in a pan and stand there and look at it for ten minutes instead of pinging it for two minutes
you can do it in the microwave in five
thank you very much indeed chef brian turner as far as i am concerned guys i think we've all had a little bit of a debate about that you'll always get something like that on ready steady cook you're also guaranteed wonderful food which we'll have in a matter of minutes very little time gentlemen let's get on with it one point five minutes to go
there's some raspberry sauce to go with your chocolate sauce nick yeah
i've just made a bit of praline here we should really let the caramel cool down but we don't have that time i quite like these strings of caramel don't try this at home because these are very hot and you could easily burn yourself
coming up to the minute mark now gentlemen
a nice bit of height on there
nick nick can you get the meringue over please
do you need it in a bag yeah i need it on top of that
over the top of that ice cream nick please
ten nine eight seven six five four three two one stop cooking come back and join us come on how you doing will good thank you you don't get ten minutes to produce this type of food
four days we had for the competition so are you impressed not bad
do you like that not bad this is the one when ainsley used that filo pastry sealed it with an egg strawberries inside simple raspberry sauce melted dark chocolate strong cocoa percentage works well with strawberries
now you tuck into those things because we've got a couple of other people who are used to high quality food that our chefs produce it can only be matt dawson and roger black come back in here boys pick up your cutlery time for a bit of dessert

i was chuffed to be in the final and philosophical about not winning the money it's just one of those things
i love music and i like to be pretty creative l. really like oil painting l. don't have much inspiration in forest hill particularly playing music the flat is quite small so i had been banished to the loft it is not ideal because there is no natural light or inspiration l. would like some countryside and
this piece of grass this piece of land is overlooked by our neighbours l. up in denmark in the countryside my parents brought me up to appreciate the countryside and i really miss it what i am really looking for now is an english cottaged garden vegetables make my own jams relishes i would really like that
home grown veg aside they are not quite ready for the good life so they will still rely on their local amenities when they move
the problem that london high streets they are full of chain stores take aways everything is really and personal the traffic roaring in the background there is no sense of
floor through the front door is
hallway where daniel has workstation the first run you come to is the bedroom
a double bedroom plenty of sunlight a good size overlooking
the communal garden up up the corridor a refurbished bathroom and the dining and living room which lead to a small kitchen
one of the disadvantages of the kitchen is not grow it is small but it is very well used it leads directly into the living room and offsets
the disadvantage outside outside the flat their communal garden and private parking area i have had your flat valued for you
the most important thing for me is how much you can afford to spend on your new
it is still within an easy commute
daniel how long a commuter are you happy to do daily
door to door no more than an hour one hour and a
quarter essentials
bigger kitchen
would you rather be in a village or the middle of
i am going to offer you the chance to say anything that would be a bonus things that would sell a property to you
i a third bedroom would be great views
period fireplaces
somewhere to park the car would be
hope that north kent can come up with enough of the chocolate boxy villages of their imagination with the area so popular and the markets are buoyant my concern is that properties may be selling faster than i can see them so they have two hundred fifty thousand for their english country cottage which is a tall order in kent they need two bedrooms a good sized kitchen and their own private garden the main thing is's is daniel's canute so they need a train station as close as possible commute this blissful country scene may seem a long way from the city but i have only travel twenty miles south of forest hill mind you kent has not always been this peaceful it is hard to imagine that this gorgeous tranquil landscape has actually been home to civil wars numerous rebel uprisings and countless invasions over two thousand years ago julius caesar began his british invasion here he famously uttered i came i saw i conquered kent is becoming more and more attractive to london commuters eager to settle in the country but this means competition for property is fierce for every house on the market there are fifty potential buyers l. start off in this quiet village just eight miles north of sevenoaks the village has a population of one thousand six hundred and there's only a church and a pub but a twenty minute stroll takes you to all of the amenities in nearby borough green saint mary's platt is in the heart of the kent countryside which should please daniel and kalle because they want to swap city fumes for fresh air and there are plenty of places for bracing walks this spacious terrace cottage has two bedrooms two reception rooms and a huge garden back in forest hill they are keeping up to date with my progress
not very quaint but it's period
on earth has she brought us to this property for because this is an a road
that's right
that's right the middle of this month we will hear from the council if they are going to take it further
it is busier than outside here
we would have to check that out
lovely hallway is it quite unusual to have a hallway in a cottage
it is in this one most of the others have open plan rooms
quite nice
it makes a difference with entertaining the current owners can make a table bigger to fit a lot more people around
i like that
and we flow through into the kitchen which my boys will laugh because it's about ten times the size of the one they have got love
huge compared to the
it is smaller but it is cosy especially when the fire is going
a very narrow very narrow
one thing that strikes me about this property it is so recently and neutrally renovated that they could move in with no worries about diy arguments they might want to use a paintbrush to give it their look they did not want contemporary but they will be hard pushed to resist this bathroom
yeah
very nice
the middle the smallest of the two bedrooms this is a bit of a disappointment you could squeeze a double bed in here and i really do mean squeeze
really squeeze very small
into the master bedroom no worries about space in here it's a really good room we have two big rooms we have a lot of natural light plenty of space for the bed there are fitted cupboards but there is the obvious place to put them on either side of the fireplace which i am guessing is an original feature
the kitchen first of all have you a very good sized patio area then this section of lawn
the summer
that is a bit much the whole idea is get out to a countryside to move to a road that is busy
i love the kitchen and the bathroom
my search continues in the village of bourough green seven miles north of sevenoaks this was once a quiet hamlet where locals of the rootham parish met for games of sport the arrival of the railway transformed it into a thriving
green with wealth of shops and
third bedroom
or straight from the street into the living room these are victorian cottages yes it was built in one thousand eight hundred seventy four it's so a proper period house
they were one of the original cottages built for bourough green they were built particularly for the station
which is my key point daniel will be commuting he has a five minute walk from here
they are original
so quite a few features in here it's not huge but i suppose the fact you have the glass doors opening into the next area makes it feel bigger
it does
very similar to the kind of style we are thinking of
it has funky decoration is this
she has put her stamp on it but things like that are easy to remove obviously through here we are going into the kitchen
not much bigger than we have now
it's seclude and it's
plenty of space for good few vegetables and keeping lovely entertaining space for when the visitors come down
project that need doing this is bedroom one plenty of space for double bed
a good sized bedroom
next along the hallway we come to bedroom number two it's not a bad size overlooked the garden it's currently being used as an office but maybe it could be used as a
at the far end of the cottage at the back of the house this is the bathroom l. think thiss a real bonus quite often in the railway workers cottages you will fipdz that the bathroom is downstairs not only is it on the first floor but it's good size
so the top floor has been converted to make a third bedroom one of my bonuss and i haven't even had to go to full budget to get it
you have sloping ceilings the main part of the room has good head height it's a pleasant double bedroom so great extra space for the visiting friends
it's huge
that could be the master
i like the fact it has a third bedroom kitsch s. n. a nightmare but certainly have to think about that the kitchen is
still to come an escape to the country realise for kalle it's all about the aesthetics when he changes his tune about being overlooked
that is quite nice
the inside sounds spacious but all of this doesn't come cheap being right at the top end of daniel and kalle's two hundred fifty thousand budget the current owner kate has lived in the cottage for five years hello
a local pub to walk to it's handy how much noise do you get
not at all we don't hear anything we are in the front bedroom
what is in here
the cellar we use it as a storage facility we did have a quote at one point to have it tanked you could convert it to another room it has electricity
yes lovely
we inherited it spot on a lot of wood
i like the stable door which way are we facing
it's walled and it's private quite quite small
have you a good lawn space l. am thinking vegetable patches could hard some space here
yes i was thinking that is that enough space for all the ideas you have for a garden
i think it's a start
coming upstairs you come first of all into the original the old part of the house which is at the front here this is the master bedroom now it's not a bad size it has fitted wardrobes which is handy on this side of the house kate and her have had secondary glazing fitted l. l. have never seen wooden before but it works quite well coming out into the hallway you have the world's highest window which lets in a lot of light into the hallway here then in the centre of the bedrooms nice and practical is the bathroom a good
i would have to see them to work out what you could do
it could be an option to knock down the wall to have a two bedroom house
that looks nice
we find it easier to come in at the side
so it's galley kitchen how
i am not sure it's that practical looks awkward with the bin
i don't know
we have door here what is that
that is the bathroom through there
i have a thing about having a bathroom next to a kitchen
all of that is newly fitted has it been recently done
it was there when we moved in about four years ago ynk they had just done it then
had well done
it is quite cosy
it really suits the style of the house somehouse these originally were railway worker's cottages that is fantastic for commuting but how much train noise do you get
you get used to it we only have a couple of trains every hour they stop at the station so you don't really hear them of
i am not convinced
a practical issue is that these two neighbours have a right of way in and out of their garden apparently they don't use it that often they have got their own back doors anyway and they are all very friendly which is a prerequisite because as you can see there is no privacy between these four gardens
it is not private but that kind of set up you don't expect it to be
it is very green down one side
space wise it is very good one hundred forty five feet altogether just the kind of garden you can imagine really big vegetable patch to grow your own and there is still space for table and chairs with a glass of wine in the evenings that is the station behind me it gives you an idea of the proximity great for the commuter it means you will get a bit of train noise
trains going past to know how bad it would be
i should point out that this is a steep small staircase it might have been swung around and made small at some stage to create more space it leads to two bedrooms this is the first a very sweet little fireplace which i imagine is an original feature and it is a good size perfect as a guest room a good fitted cupboard as well into bedroom number two it is really nice to see this property has kept a lot of the original fittings l. am pretty sure that is one of the original doors another fireplace which matches the one next door a lovely cemetery
they could make an en suite up here and use it as a guest bathroom in it's nice
let's have look at the four we have seen didn't get anything from that one
it i liked the bathroom
you can't buy a house for bathroom a bathroom it is on a main road
it's a no
the second one the bedroom was a bonus
i like the bedroom in the loft
i did i love it
a nice looking
in that case
three bedrooms as
stunning it looks straight on to a little orchard and pretty far which
and here is the house what do you think
a good sized garden behind it as well let's have a good look around in you come
straight into the living room
that's really nice l. like it
i like it it's
cosy very very cosy a great little fireplace it is a lot bigger than i expected from the front from the outside
which we asked for and great kitchen
it's huge
it it is being under used
first come and admire the wonderful kitchen
it is a stunning kitchen
they have managed to do the kitchen extension and still leave a sizable garden at the back you can have a look at that later the bathroom is on this floor just through here how do you feel about that
i don't mind it being on the ground floor just how close it is to the kitchen could be a problem
when you look upstairs i think there is an option to remedy it bear that in
come back on the market they have already had lot of you ins if you like it bear in mind that we cannot and around a lot of viewings on that note have a look at the bathroom he wow
very new it does not matter if the bathroom is modern you can't really have a nineteenth century bathroom
a few into the garden a view into the garden
nice to have a bit of extra space
it's enormous room for all of my vegetables
i can see
hold those thoughts we have another property to see let's have a look at that one next welcome to cobham the very different from the house we saw this morning you are located right on the village street how do you feel about that
don't mind at all very little traffic compared to the last place
a pretty village i really like it
you said you wanted a handy pub
that's incredibly handy you could reach out and grab a pint
what are your impressions
from the outside stunning very stunning very period
i love the windows
even seen inside let's have a look
it's not
look at the fireplace
have a look how does it compare with walking
it's very big
and again
set out very nicely a little eating area
you have got couple of properties
so that's all right then still a lot more to explore so have a look around and see what you think
we can see the pub over their l. can keep an eye on you
a small double bed
we could use the little room for the keyboards
so we have seen both properties in kent decision time of the two i think i know the answer but which one do you prefer
definitely this
tick every box takeed every box the views were great but it did not have the wow factor
it's everything we are looking for and it has a cellar extra storage fantastic feeling and the village
from denmark a bit of what england
flat on the market in forest hill so you can become better buyers the lady that owns it has already found property so she needs and
got to pitch your offer correctly
we will have to think about that seriously
i am so excited
still fragile signs of life but
that's right in fact we have seen a number of parents directing their anger at the authorities because we did see so many school buildings collapse killing many children inside the authorities have respond to do that they have said they are going to launch an investigation they say if they do find anyone who has been using shoddy building practices they will be punished but whatever the outcome of that inquiry it's going to be little comfort for the parents who lost their children
the policeman beaten up by mob of rangers supporters in manchester on wednesday night has been talking about his ordeal p. c. mick regan said he feared he'd be seriously hurt as the supporters closed in on him b. b. c. news has obtained new pictures of the violence which marred the uefa cup final here's mark simpson is still reeling and his hands are still shaking
at the time i thought he been pushed over just hit on the left elbow by a bottle and i was starting to withdraw up newton street and i ended up on the floor the next thing i was getting kicked in the body on the legs l. knew i was in serious trouble as the other officers had withdrawn up the street l. thought i was going to get hurt l. was trying to activate my emergency button and i couldn't get to it at that point one thought i'm in serious trouble here because these people are going to try to hurt me l. manage to do get up and run you can see my colleagues at the top of the street that's myself in the middle this man threw the botle at me l. tripped up there
looking at that again how does it make you feel
funnily enough watching it from there now its brings it all back to you at the time it's frightening let's put it that way it is like a flashback it seems worse now that i see them attacking me like that not just me but my colleagues as well the fear factor is starting to come i was just trying to defend myself the best i could after that it was help get me out of here
she said the child was hers but council officers had seen her only a few months before and knew the child couldn't have been hers as she wasn't pregnant she then changed the story and said she was the adoptive mother of the child council officers were not satisfied with her explanation and were of the opinion she was using the child to gain ascom days
she's brought this baby out of its home vierpblgts for the sole purpose of gaining benefits for herself without any regard for the child's future if child will probably grow up without knowing its identity or where it's come from
peace sandberg got through immigration because she had the right paperwork this is not an isolated case
we get information brought to us about suspicions of child trafficking particularly for housing benefit fraud from social service and children's organisations it doesn't seem to be getting report to do police but we believe it is much more widespread than people realise
uneventful day today just what b. a. wants passengers were complementary especially about willie walsh's decision not to take a bonus
they have shrunk into profitability unlike many airlines which will press on regardless building market share they have
pesticides a new compound would take about ten years to develop that is taking into account all of the legal hoops that you have to go through we are talking hundreds of millions of dollars as well
absolutely critical they will set policy for the next ten years possibly the next few decades so they have to have the protection of public health being the number one priority and it would be a travesty if they were weakened or watered down from industry lobbying
but farmers argue that at a time of rising prices and concern about food shortages they need every possible tool available to kill the pests that damage our crops
i think the danger is that we will be so selective that we will be in the hands of very few chemical manufacturers so therefore the cos we'll go up inevitably and we cannot afford that the costs
emerged from the shadow of nineteen twenty seven until this season to say this is a big year for the club is an understatement the club has nearly gone out of business they are in the process of moving to this new home in the heart of the city and there is the small matter of the f. a. cup final after languishing in the lower leagues city hope the move from ninian park will help propel the club forward winning the cup could mean three million for the club

but will they tackle crime or people's fear of crime also tonight dwain chambers will launch an appeal to compete in the olympics and we are in the north london borough that has already got these and wants to bring in these to make and ooh ah just a little bit eurovision on the west end stage good evening and welcome to b. b. c. london news it was one of his key election pledges to make public transport safer so this morning mayor boris johnson unveiled the new police teams which will be deployed across london's bus network but crime on buses is already falling so is the money being well spent our transport correspondent tom edwards is at vauxhall cross bus station now tom does this mean extra
arson on a bus in haringey this offender got eighteen months but crime
and antisocial behaviour are
concern to passengers
i can see youngsters making a lot of noise on the buses they kick the seats and put their feet up if you tell them they're very rude
i've just got off a bus and someone was causing problems all because the driver wouldn't let him out in the middle of the traffic bang and crashing it is ridiculous
it wasn't long before those who live here like maureen reynolds were making their voices heard are you convinced this will make a difference
i will wait and see i will see what he is going to do and see if it works at big job ahead but i would like it to work
the met's figures show that crime on buses is coming down but travel watchdogs and passengers say there is still a problem with low level antisocial behaviour many people blame free fraful for young people each team will have two police and
things that the new mayor doesn't want to do which the old one did i'm comfortable to give another nine million to the met on top of the
she hasn't been able to get out much she would ring in every saturday like clockwork give us a list of shopping and by ten to eleven
its to have changed it was getting better it's had its things over the years then it got better and this happens it makes you wonder i've lived in the worst parts of london and even
into other areas of at lettics this is the european indoor championships doing it clean and doing it best rung very fast in a straight line he got a silver medal this is a man who wants to come back very badly indeed
it is better if the cars are aware of the children at very good idea because there's so many children in the area and schools as well
it's the noise or the extra pollution caused by speed humps when we can get government approval to use average speed cameras that will be a great advance for us
it's a dream it was a dream of the club even more than anything else to be in the final
high hopes at chelsea as the blues aim to become london's first rf european champions and euro vision fever hits the west end after years of rising house prices the credit crunch seems to be hitting the property market in london so is it finally time for first time buyers who have been waiting for downturn to take that step on the property ladder kemi lewis is rentsing her flat in putney but is dreaming of buying her own place in clapham her budget is two hundred ninety with fifteen thousand savered but she has too many uns unanswered questions about whether now is the right time
should i continue paying rent or should i jump on the housing bandwagon is it a good time for a first time buyer
in rented accommodation it can be pretty expensive rents are actually going up so if they can find a seller who is willing to negotiate and they can negotiate hard then it could be a good time to buy a lot of the lenders will draw the line at two hundred fifty thousand as their loan amount if you have only got a five per cent deposit the answer is either to hold off for a couple of years take advantage of some of the really great interest rates that are available for savings accounts use your eyes so allowance and save up some cash or go in with a friend your isa allowance
a lot of developers at the moment have got huge stocks of finished properties which are not selling also there is some good news some interest rates are coming down slightly that is all good news so with two experts advising her to buy and one to save what will kemi do next
i want to look at how much money i have got currently which isn't very much and look at whether i can actually save quite aggressively over the next six months two years
for kemi like thousands of londoners the buzz word is wait if you are struggling to sell your property or you have got another tale to tell about housing get in touch with us now five days left until the biggest football match ever played between two english clubs kicks off chelsea meet manchester united in the champions' league final in moscow on wednesday mark bright is here to tell us more united got the better of chelsea at the weekend can chelsea strike back
absolutely over thirty eight games there was only two points between them l. am going to this game i am really looking forward to it but london teams have not had much luck in the champions' league way back in nineteen sixty two spurs lost in the semi final chelsea have lost three times in the semi final so if they are going to win this trophy they have got to get rid of the capital who do
it's the most sought after prize in club football when liverpool got their hands on it for the fifth time three years ago close to one million people came out onto the streets to celebrate six years previously there were similar scenes in manchester when united lifted it for the second time in their history but the famous trophy has never been to london it is fifty three years since the trophy was founded and no team from the capital has ever won it but chelsea are aiming to change all of that avram grant was a surprise choice to take over from jose mourinho back in september but his players are determined to help him succeed where the special one failed
it is for the fans and everybody that supports chelsea we want to make chelsea we want to make history
it is special for me and for chelsea they have never been in the final before l. hope i will come back with the title
it is a dream it has been the dream of the club even more than anything else to be in the final especially after losing three semi finals but we don't want the dream to stay in the semi final
in nineteen eighty two half of birmingham was bouncing when aston villa claimed the cup for the second city and even the good folk of nottingham have twice experienced european glory thanks to the fine work of brian clough the search for london's first european champions goes on with chelsea have been a magical night in moscow will put an end to the capital cost like you said none of our clubs have won in europe i find it incredible
yes looking around europe amsterdam barcelona madrid milan glasgow all of these cities have had teams which won the trophy it does not seem right that london has never won this trophy
but at least chelsea are going to moscow the country of roman abramovich
he said he wants chelsea to be kings of europe honestly he has spent over half a billion pounds ranieri tried and failed mourinho tried and failed now avram grant stance on the verge of creating history stands
after being picked up opposed by man united in the premiership are chelsea looking for revenge
it is whatever term you use revenge they know they can beat man united in any one of game they did it last year in the f. a. cup final they did it three weeks ago in the
looking at would be it could be a farewell for a big name looking at rugby
he is a big chelsea fan lawrence dallaglio but he cannot be at the match if wasps win the semi final they will be going to twickenham for the final
half a dozen clubs you have been a one club man
it is a nice thing to be able to say but i have still been fairly ruthless and selfish in my career the reason for joining wasps was very simple when i left school i looked in the paper and they were top of the leak l. thought that's a pretty good place to start l. have always wanted to be competitive league l. have always wanted to play for england and wasps have given me the opportunity so i have kind of used wasps and wasps have used me and it seems to have worked
life after playing you briefly said you have got things to do you want to enjoy life is there a plan
chambers while you are here you were incensed when he competed in the world indoor championships do you think he stands a chance of overturning this ban
year again the eurovision song contest which takes place in belgrade next week some people have been getting into the mood early including the cast members of some of the west end's biggest shows they have been paying tribute to the competition approaching midnight this west end theatre is filling up it is all because of the attraction of a certain type of music
soon you will find there comes a time for making your mind up
cheryl baker was here as a judge for london's take on the eurovision song contest
doing it for the
i thought they were tremendous i thought the whole show was fabulous every act every cast from every show they really did their homework it was a wonderful evening i really enjoyed myself i am so glad i was invited
it's judgment day on great british menu where fourteen of our very best chefs are battling for the honour of showing that cutting edge british cooking is second to none the winners will serve their dishes at a banquet to be held at the top of the gherkin in the city of london hosting that prestigious meal will be none other than heston blumenthal himself a leading trailblazer of contemporary cooking and his guests will include members of the world's gastronomic elite flying in especially for the night our chefs have everything to prove duelling for the last place in our national final are the two chefs representing london and the south east despite being old friends atul kochhar and jason atherton have been striving for supremacy all week today one will continue in the competition and one will leave defeated
i'm confident i'm always confident
i wouldn't be here if i didn't want to beat him there'd be no point being here
preparing for their final round of culinary combat today are two of the south east's top chefs the first to arrive is two time regional champ and michelin star holder atul kochhar with a mission to stick to superbly executed british indian cooking he's more determined than ever to win a place in the final
i really want to get through i'm here so far and i'd like to see myself through it's important i do that
striving to take the regional crown off atul is fellow michelin starred chef jason atherton competitive to the last he's hoping that his modern british meals with international influences will tickle the taste buds of our expert panel
i'm a british chef cooking modern food totally regional my food deserves a place at the gherkin but only the judges will decide that
matthew fort prue leith and oliver peyton know what they're looking for but they also know that deciding which of these chefs goes through to the finals will be a very tough choice
i think this is going to be the most competitive day that we've got as judges i honestly believe jason is one of the finest chefs in britain
he's up against one of the finest chefs in britain too
atul kochhar for me is one of the finest exponents of a food very particular to this country
in the past with atul i feel that he's been a little constrained by our emphasis on britishness but this time he'll have more freedom
today each chef will serve up his entire four course modern british menu for the judges
atul hey all right are you going to kick my ass today i'd never do that
it's the starters first of course and for his dish atul will be putting a modern spin on the good old cup of char and biscuits he's serving a refreshing chilled pea soup with cumin foam and mini poppadoms or poori topped with peas and potatoes which took forever to cook on monday
atul bringing back any bad memories bad memories
i've got no bad memories
on the other side of the kitchen jason will be putting his modern twist on a plate of sandwiches he's come up with a twenty first century b. l. t. in a glass accompanied by a croque monsieur with truffles atul's starter is going first the key to the dish is getting the delicate balance of cumin right in his soup the foam topping and the mini poppadoms perfecto atul must concentrate but jason is doing his best to distract him
have you been thinking about the gherkin atul yeah i haven't forgotten it's like the chief inspector of michelin walking in like a room of them never mind just one of them that's true it's pressure it's real pressure yeah
the soup is ready come on jason this is a serious competition the poppadoms are nearly done and there's just one important thing left to make
the foam ready i'll just make it in the last minute you did that last time
earlier in the week atul had a major upset with his foam so incredibly his rival volunteers to make it for him well they are friends
now we're rocking and rolling the daddy's back
so once the self appointed father of foam has whipped up a storm atul applies the finishing touches to his dish the poppadoms are topped off with a touch of tamarind chutney and the soup gets a good head of jason's foam
they look beautiful where do you want these atul on the side on the side please
thank you go slow happy happy very happy and i can't thank you enough for the foam
i wonder what the judges will make of atul's pea soup and little poori that's if they can tell it is soup
poori isn't it underneath mm
very light almost crumbly texture slightly sandy
this is so interesting because pea soup is very british and although he must have a dozen flavours in that little poori it's not one brown mess
i never thought i'd hear you sing the praises of a dish with a foam on top
i can see chefs at the gherkin i can see them wolfing that down with a certain amount of pleasure this is a strong modern dish
i can see this at the gherkin it really fits all the criteria
it's very modern this is modern british cooking
it leaves you fresh and geared up for the next course
so a cracking start for atul but of course he doesn't know that the chefs won't hear the judge's verdict until the end of the day when they've tasted all the dishes jason's starter is going next he's putting together a very modern take on a plate of sandwiches it'll be a stylish dish but atul can't resist poking fun at it
how are your american sandwiches coming along
they're really good i was even going to fry a burger in there sounds good to me
there's a french element too a croque monsieur garnished with truffles he then assembles the b. l. t. itself tomato consomme jelly is topped with bacon and onion cream onion rings and bacon lardons on monday atul thought that the lettuce veloute or sauce that jason is serving alongside it tasted like spinach so has he made any changes
is it lettuce tastes like lettuce this time
what do you mean this time it tasted like lettuce last time did it
then it's off to the judges
i think that's my sort of not weakest dish but i'm a little nervous about it that's all
it is quite a complicated idea so it'll be interesting to see what the judges make of it
mm it's a cocktail party oh look canapes oh my goodness what's that green stuff looks like health food i think this is just such fun
i guess so
it makes you happy just to eat it doesn't it
um it's cheese and ham it's a croque monsieur with a croque monsieur ah i must say it's rather like trying to do a crossword this a series of clues in there
a b. l. t. is very american and a croque monsieur is very french
so are we having a universal this is a nod to the international chefs isn't it
this is as good as it gets for me he didn't wake up one morning forget to shave go into the kitchen and make this dish this is a dish that has been developed by a very very smart chef
it's seasonal it's summery it's innovative it's pretty it's got that banquety wow factor
i'm never going to be able to eat a b. l. t. ever again because i'm going to want this indeed
so a great result for jason too but it's straight on to the fish courses and atul is first to go again he's cooking his version of a salmon madras served with a little tomato chutney on top of semolina polenta and there will be a curry leaf foam this time to finish off the fish on tuesday atul lost time when he overheated the poaching pan for his salmon today he's playing it safe and using a water bath to cook the fish instead which hasn't escaped the eagle eyes of his rival who will be using the same technique
shall i say you inspired me will that make you happy
i'm always happy atul's new method has paid off
the salmon is perfect
look it's gorgeous
i think i should just crisp the skin lightly yeah
you wouldn't think they're arrivals at all
if i go through next time if i have to compete again i'll bring you with me
then i'm surely winning if you are my sous chef
he is already really atul's got him doing this foam too
oops
i'd use it to shave these days it's a bit passe right
it's a bit passe maybe it's still new for me maybe
atul can now plate up the salmon goes on to the sambal sauce and the semolina polenta is dressed with tomato and raisin chutney
if you go quick we can actually get this on the time
that's a bit cheeky i'll be quick the finishing touch of course the curry leaf foam
stop the clock done
wow look at that nice guys huh
but once the dishes have gone off to the judges jason drops a bombshell
i found out from a source reliable or unreliable very reliable the judges hate foam they hate foam
well he could have told atul that while he was making it but it's too late now as his salmon madras complete with foam hits the judges' table
d'you know i'm sorry i'm going to go on about froths and foams now
yes do foam at the mouth what is the point of this foam
it has no flavour it's just like spit on the plate what is it about
the leaves inside it i suppose you can eat them
no you can't i defy you to eat those leaves
i've just eaten mine i eat everything as you know prue
i like this fish finger looking thing i think it's fish finger couscous it's out of semolina i think
it's absolutely light as thistle down that's quite nice
if you like semolina pudding it's quite nice are you saying that you don't like semolina pudding prue well this is just mild soggy semolina with some very nice tomato ketchup on top
i think the salmon tastes quite nice it's very nicely cooked but i don't think it's good enough for this competition to be honest with you nor me
i think there's very little flavour in the curry sauce very low impact do we talk about things been feeble flavoured
or do we talk about them being delicate i think that's quite a delicate sauce
i sort of agree with you but i don't even think this dish is particularly modern a foam foam the hallmark of modern cooking that's one of the hallmarks of modern cooking i don't like the one bit of modernity on this dish is the one thing i really hate
well atul's fish course sank like a stone now it's jason's turn and he's using salmon too his fish though has already been cured and lightly smoked so there's not much cooking involved the salmon will sit next to an avocado puree with horseradish snow and will be topped with a rye bread cracker the salmon is vacuum packed with olive oil and dropped into a water bath for ten minutes jason may not have been too confident about his starter but he thinks he has a winner with this course
my fish dish i'm really pleased with my meat and my
fish dish you should be pleased with because you didn't have to cook it
it's the love and attention it's been prepared with that's the thing i don't just stick things in a wok you know
he said that with a straight face so i think he was joking he's nearly finished now all he has to do is finely slice the rye bread for his cracker blitz up his avocado puree and salt the salmon but simple dishes need very careful presentation if they're not to look easy a little caviar should help but the really classy touch is the horseradish flavoured snow
quality of snow is good it's ready to go
i know you're dying to ask me why snow in summer yeah why not indeed just be careful when you're taking the cloches off you don't knock the twill quick as you can please so the snow doesn't melt
but will the judges appreciate the snow
well that is a big thick chunk of salmon
you'll have to like raw fish to like this dish
no this is not raw is it smoked this is what happens when you cook at very low temperature
i'll tell you something now i've been listening to what you've been saying
i hang upon your every word
you should hang upon this i don't like it
why is that i think the salmon is too slab like i will startle you even more it's a bit salty
i'm gonna say something else i don't think the quality of the fish is that good
i think sadly it doesn't quite work
we've sort of moved it seems to me from the ballet slippers of the first course to clog dancing with this really
we are now halfway through the menus and both chefs are enjoying mixed fortunes still to come we find out which of the dishes gets this response
this is what i did call a very brave dish i'm not sure it's a very well advised dish
and we'll discover whether it's atul or jason who takes the one remaining place in our national final
the chef going forward to represent london and the south east in the final of the great british menu is
so now it is on to the main course jason will be the first to plate up he's chosen a hearty dish of dexter beef fillet with ox cheek smoked pomme puree and marrowbone he's even got into trouble of bringing along his own wooden platters to serve it on both chefs have high hopes for this competition but while jason gets on with preparing his beef talk in the kitchen turns to their previous achievements
so you always wanted a michelin star
i just know how important they are to a young chef like myself growing up into that whole michelin environment did you always have ambitions to get michelin starred and be the first indian cuisine type restaurant to get on i never aimed for it
the first time i was told i hung the phone up
why did you hang the phone up
i couldn't believe it i thought it was somebody pulling a prank on me finally they called me and said i'm being serious
since that call atul's career has gone from strength to strength he has won this heat in both previous great british menu competitions has he finally met his match in jason for his main course he's pan frying beef fillets braising some ox cheek and adding a smoky flavour to his pomme puree all that remains is to plate up or whatever you call it on a posh chopping board
but will they this is definitely a dish for serious carnivores
this is sort of prehistoric man's platter isn't it a very senior piece of beautiful beef isn't it i wasn't thinking of that i was thinking of the mashed potato looks like something has been lifted out of some sort of swamp bristling like that
this beef is heaven
i think the potato and the um the cheek are just perfect it's a real celebration of produce that's a great piece of beef
one can't say this is the most summery looking dish we've ever seen i don't mind because it tastes so wonderful
i don't think it's modern a la air blowing round the plate and that but this is an extremely well constructed dish i would be extremely happy to see this at the gherkin excellent meat
and the smoked mash i think was a little touch of genius it's perfect
so jason's main course has got him back on track with the judges can atul redeem himself with this course too he is going for an aylesbury duck breast with duck foie gras ice cream a coriander and coconut pesto and a garnish of mango and pineapple salsa he's decided to serve the duck breasts warm rather than hot leaving the meat very rare will that be to the judges' taste i wonder before they even get a chance to try it disaster strikes atul's foie gras ice cream
the machine has broken down
what's happened atul the blade is broken
the blade that churns the ice cream has sheared off leaving atul in the lurch his duck breasts are nearly ready but for now his dish has to be put on hold it's a major blow
come on atul we're gonna get it sorted out i'm on the phone now
luckily jason has a similar machine in his restaurant which is only a few minutes from here a quick phone call is all it takes for a replacement blade to be dispatched to the great british menu kitchen
they are both desperate to win but they've been really supportive of one another all week atul quickly bounces back
look at that
you're normally not like that atul i'm not like that at all you're like an asian james bond shaken but not stirred shaken
does that make jason miss moneypenny then
thanks a lot i can't thank you enough my pleasure made my day
atul is back in business and his foie gras ice cream is soon ready to join the warm duck breasts as he plates up
oh this is good
even with the complications and delays atul still has every faith that his duck dish is a winner
ice cream look perfect and tasted fine the duck looked perfect thank god thanks to modern technology i could hold the duck at forty degrees i'm happy with that
the duck itself it's very tasty but it's just not a marriage it's just not right
this is what i would call a very brave dish i'm not sure it's a very well advised dish
every one of these there's sort of parfait and that coriander and coconut pesto thing even the raw duck would be really a lot better on a piece of toast i mean they cry out for something crisp and
it also cries out for a bit of heat doesn't it yeah hot and crisp it's a modern dish insofar as nothing quite like it has ever been seen before
or will again
it's time for the puddings
well that one didn't come off for atul but the chefs get little time to reflect on judgment day they have to get on with their desserts jason's going first again with his arctic roll raspberry salad and a raspberry and sarawak pepper jelly
now atul had never even heard of arctic roll until yesterday so is updating a british childhood favourite a wise choice for a banquet where some of the guests may not get the joke
so you do you think all these guests will understand your humour about arctic roll
i'm hoping heston's gonna if we get through heston will help me out hopefully if we get through of course
ready
away you go there you go it looks beautiful if they don't like it they don't like it there's nothing i can do that's the style of food i cook it's the style of food i serve in my restaurant so it is really now down to the judges
it certainly is so will jason's dessert be grand enough for the banquet in june
oh that's wonderful it's arctic roll
it was the height of sophistication when i was growing up
is it good
delicious you're finally in your element then yeah very good it's proper jelly too delicious
do you think i eat the flowers
oh yes flowers are there for eating it's a pudding which is going to mean rather less to you if you didn't grow up with arctic roll and jelly if you didn't have an english childhood
luckily matthew i'm not as old as you so i don't remember this dish but it's nice the roll thing looked very pretty when it came up it's vanilla ice cream
it was restrained not too much and very delicately done i'm not going to say it was the best pudding i've ever eaten but it was very nice
so they all enjoyed it but will that be enough to win the competition atul's final dish is a green cardamom lime pannacotta with a strawberry sorbet and strawberry topped shortbread biscuits he needs this to be absolutely perfect so can he forget the setbacks he had with the last course
do you like zen them out
no i'm always like that jason and if there was any bad memory i don't remember
choosing rectangles of pannacotta that have the right thickness of jelly atul begins plating up he caramelises his sliced strawberries in a frying pan and tops his shortbread biscuits with strawberry sauce and sorbet the final dish is on its way to the judges' chamber
well he won't have to wait too long now to find out what they make of his dessert
pretty in pink
pretty in jelly
jelly jelly
with a little sort of panacotta or something underneath or do you think that's another milk jelly
it looks like a milk jelly to me
crunchy oat shortbread underneath actually that is a very very nice pannacotta and a very nice jelly
yes a very nice pannacotta and jelly
well i think it's delicious and it's not wildly original but it's interestingly spiced
i'm going to go out on a limb here again i'm going to say this is a safe pair of hands i think someone here has gone for the safety game
i think if this went to the gherkin then i think there would be a bit of sort of raised eyebrow and so what from the assembled dignitaries
so the judges have eaten their last course and it's now time for them to consider their verdict while the chefs wait anxiously to hear their fate the judges can see the full menus at last they may well have their individual favourite dishes but they can't pick and choose they have to consider the menus as a whole and vote for the one they think is the most cutting edge and inventive example of top quality contemporary british food
we got off to such a tremendous start with both the first courses but they both had weak moments i can think of at least one course that i thought was more interesting than it was edible if you know what i mean
at least two courses all right come on have you made up your mind i've made up my mind
i have too
and indeed so have i
i guess we need to bring in the chefs
it's crunch time the chefs are called into the judges' chamber for the final verdict
welcome chefs how are you feeling
very nervous for us it's been a very difficult day but we have eaten
some you know what i consider to be world beating food today so i'm going to ask my fellow judges who they are voting for
menu a menu a matthew menu a
get in there
congratulations well done thank you
well done jason jason well done
there were two amazing dishes the starter was absolutely incredible
and boiled beef which was just stunning
everything was fantastic about it so really
we even for gave you for not being particularly summery we just thought it was so wonderful
atul as always an extraordinarily illuminating and graceful exercise in cooking a wonderful individual style but on the day i voted for jason because when you deliver a dish it has an extraordinary precision of flavour and i think today you cooked two absolutely outstanding courses and the rest of them weren't too bad either
jason i look forward to seeing you in the final thank you oliver
thank you pru thank you matthew thank you here you go guys siobhan and one last foam for you atul cheers guys
i'm sad that the spices were not very present which is culturally very british but very happy for jason because i do think he's a really cutting edge chef
it was one of the scariest things i've ever done going into that room but you know i've come out victorious and i'm a very very happy bunny
i believe they are sincere and they are concerned about people and concerned about this devastation that has happened in sichuan province but i think as anything in china it is a highly it is highly orchestrated by the government and a great showcase for them to demonstrate their competence their engagement with the world in humanitarian rescue efforts particularly after what happened in tibet
they are very much complement each other don't they president hu is more stern and the premier wen jiaobao styles himself as a man of the people add an effective tool in terms of media coverage are they
in tiananmen square when you were protesting all those years ago they are not the kind of leaders who sent him
no next generation
the communications are open for this it is a natural disaster it is a disaster that had nothing to do with the government it was not caused by any political issue this is a perfect opportunity for the government to open up and demonstrates to the chinese people and the world that they are concerned with chinese welfare and they are very competent and efficient as rescuing efforts humanitarian efforts at rescuing
how worried of the leadership that any frustration with the rescue effort might begin to popular discontent with corruption and the growing social divides that we have in china how worried are some of the worst affected areas were in the less well off parts
i would guess they are certainly concerned if you recall the past chinese new year when one hundred thousand people were stranded in train stations because of blizzard conditions the government was not very swift to resolve that crisis it caused widespread discontent among the chinese citizens i think that this time they have taken a very swift and efficient adverts at responding quickly and responding effectively to the crisis a fish and effort
your parents were caught up in the cultural revolution when you were a girl and were kept in labour camps in this part where the earthquake actually struck as a chinese person it must be extremely upsetting to you to see all of these images
in burma the authorities say they believe seventy eight thousand people have been killed by cyclone nargis which struck two weeks ago well to in the government camp the prime minister today claims the emergency relief phase was over and the rebuilding was beginning media reports from the worst affected area the irrawaddy delta say there is little sign of help from a government still reluctant to accept outside aid after almost two months of political uncertainty a date has finally been set by second run off in zimbabwe's presidential election opposition leader morgan tsvangirai has predicted he will win the election again on june the twenty seventh but only if observers from other african nations can guarantee security for the vote and africa correspondent orla guerin has been talking to mr. as tsvangirai and sends this report from johannesburg in south africa a warm welcome for a leader facing the fight of his life morgan tsvangirai making a brief appearance in belfast on the eve of returning to his homeland the hopes of many are resting on his shoulders his message here that the downfall of the mugabe dictatorship is inevitable in an earlier b. b. c. interview he said the ruling party is making overtures about a national unity government
will the conflict ended by an act as a negotiating table we're open but it is not a priority
add a reaching out to you
yes but we have said you have to demonstrate to us you have to give us the sincerity that you
are serious are they reaching
we are joined from washington by tom mcdonald the u. s. ambassador to zimbabwe from nineteen ninety seven to two thousand one he met president mugabe many times ambassador a rare admission of weakness do you read any significance
that he's a very clever fellow and so
a rare admission of weakness from president robert mugabe do you read any significance of that that
he's a very clever fellow it reminds me when he lost his first election in february two thousand the first election he had lost following his taking power in nineteen eighty
this is much more extreme this loss do you think there's a possibility perhaps senior zanu p. f. officials might be saying to him reconsider your position mr. president would he stand aside
tried to throw him out of his ten storey window when he was head of a labour movement they petrol bombed one of his cars and killed a driver of his at the time he has toed and froed some about it i would read the final as he's committed i don't think he has a choice there can't be free and fair elections under this violence
do you think outside observers must go in otherwise the vote will be a waste of time and intimidation not free and fair and outside observers not from southern africa alone what do you think the chances of that are
probably slim or none we had foreign service officers observing in the two thousand election it was a different time we were involved in the training of ten thousand domestic monitors if we could get a good delegation in to observe i wish he would consider i wish the ruling party would consider european union american observers i'm sure the brits the europeans the americans and the australians and the japanese would work with the zimbabwean authorities on proper monitoring
to the issue of illegal immigration human trafficing crimes and exploitation and prostitution and trafficking and robbery and drug related crimes
could all this be a taste of more to come italy has a new right wing government led by silvio berlusconi elected in no small part on a promise to be tough on crime and immigration the perceived link clearly implied the coalition includes the anti immigration northern league and the smaller post fascist party alianza nationale the new mayor of rome has promised to expel twenty thousand people he may have the power to do so the government is planning tough new law some fear it may target romania people there's more than a whiff of fear earlier this week a romania camp was set alight as the flames burned local people are reported to have stood and applauded the romania have been living in italy for centuries often in makeshift camps but six months ago romania joined the e. u. the barriers came down more people flooded in as e. u. members romanian citizens including the travelling romania community are entitled to move freely across all states signed up to the schengen agreement only people without proper documentation or a threat to public security can legally be deported there are concerns italy's stricter border controls may run counter to those proposals
in case of criminal cases these people should be deported i don't believe four hundred people a large group deported so far by italy to romania all of them were criminals i don't believe this
border zone we are ready for dialogue but first the georgeians must move their forces back from the border area last month abkhazia ally russia began moving hundreds of paratrooper into the break away region moscow says they are here to keep the peace but georgia's president told me he believes russia is attempting to illegally annex abkhazia recently russia stepped up support they bombed georgia in this region they brought in troops and are watching very carefully what the rest of the world would say if the world does react strongly enough or limits it is to toothless statements or general declarations the situation is not going to improve by tiz it will get worse
georgia has released this video it claims to show a russian air force jet in the act of shooting down one of the georgian zones tibilisi has called it an act of war while the politicians trade accusations nothing is being done to deal with the bitter legacy of the war all down the southern coast of abkhazia in every town and village we have been to we have found hundreds and hundreds of houses like this burnt out roofs gone windows gone these houses or many of them belongs to the two hundred fifty thousand georgeians who used to live here but were driven out in the war there's deep bitterness on both sides maria told us her only son was killed in the war
before the war we had everything here then those damn georgians desstproid it all i say kill me first i pray to god
most of the people think they won't go back any more they don't have the hope any more but that i think we will go back
the extra oxygen atoms tend to fly off they then attack and rupture the cell wallles of living organisms as it oxidises it kills them in fact it's over three thousand times more effective than chlorine bleach that's high ozone is so good at killing superbugs like mrsa and clostridium difficile so that's the science bit but here at riversway nursing home in bristol is where they've put that theory into practise matron angela glover gets the laundry clean by using a special washing machine instead of hot water and detergent it uses cold water and ozone one to kill bacteria
it's very important to me bacteria to ensure that this is an organism free area because there's obviously lots of superbugs about if you have got sixty nine residents you can imagine that every single day the
have found a huge difference since we have been using
similar to the washing machine we create ozone but in a much lafrpblger and concentrated level and which push that out into the room and when it comes in contact with bacteria on the surfaces it kills the bacteria like it does in the washing machine
this technology is wiping out life threatening bacteria and by using lower temperatures and less detergent it's also better for the environment lucy is it the solution then what are the department of health saying about it
a lot of people have good things to say about it especially treating superbugs but the n. h. s. guidelines stipulate that lawn trihas to be washed at seventy one c. and ozone is a cold system that's why they are not using it also the n. h. s. is geared up with massive laundry systems so there is no infrastructure to use it it's not had any clinical trials yet so that's another reason high it's not
yes it used to be in the old days certainly in my lifetime nurses were in charge of cleaning in hospitals that was part of your duty so you were brought up and educated in the strict disciplines of cleanliness in hospitals then they started contracted out as soon as they started doing that the rot set in because things were not as clean because people weren't as disciplined as nurses we should pay the nurses in addition to what they are being paid now
why not give the nurses the right to manage the contract cleaners properly
it's the getting people in from outside it's rigid discipline that ought to be enforced really and nurses were always train and brought up in that
there is some suggestion that it could be a cure for cancers
there is anecdotal evidence that's all they can say at the moment
do they wipe it on
go and get him some ozone go on a geography question for you you have proved your worth in science now geography some of shirley valentine was filmed in mikinos can you point to it
the findings of the survey don't surprise me because we all travel more now we believe people know more about where they are going i don't think it works like that first of all the map of europe has changed so much in the last ten or fifteen years people find it hard to keep u. up
here at luton it's the usual throng of people desperate to get away and we are going to find out if they are useless when it comes to europe do they have the slightest idea where they are going to end up before they check in their luggage let's go for an easy one where's italy
that's fairly simple
spot on whereabouts is simple poland
i'm not sure
don't look so poland worried
somewhere sunny no i don't know
never heard of the place
down down down there
top of the class stag do favourite prague
put it in the middle
that one
i'm impressed people have done really well but enough of the holiday makers now on to a couple that really should know where they are headed two cabin staff do you fly to the czech
test a bit hard for them l. think we'll start with lucy please could
where is it
is it somewhere
just point at
and i believe you are correct well done marvellous thanks for that you haven't got a map hidden in the bucket have you
let's have a reminder of what impressed you so much about it
travel in this direction and we'll find a small bay very beautiful there we are going to fish eat drink talk
heart throb was that your own moustache there
of hand
was a bit severe a bit severe now how many sessions did we have
we i had ten i don't seem to remember you having any
right right
couldn't get it financed couldn't get money from producers so he started to write to people and said to the service industry the camera and film people the actors will you do it for nothing and the script was so brilliant that we said yes
it shows on screen yes we read what a fantastic musician you were at a young age and you probably still are now we found this fantastic clip from nineteen seventy seven
what
my best pal tom chapman
at the end of the show there can't be much you don't know about the potato we have showed you every variety
and showed you how the spud could save the world
because it originated from
heathen society and people believed you had to treat it with caution because its leaves were poisonous it was here in ireland in the seventeenth century that the potential of the potato was first spotted the potato soon became the main crop in ireland they realised they could get lot of potatoes from even the smallest plot of land like this one now these will called lady beds the soil's been heaped up in rows to make it deeper and more productive the potato soon became the main crop in ireland farmers in the north west of england became the next to grow it then the scots followed then too becoming great potato producers the increased popularity was partly down to its cost look at the prices in this shop window from about nineteen ten they illustrate an important point at a time when sausages were eight p. a pound eggs were
stone so it's easy to see how by the nineteenth century the potato had become a staple food they were cheap abundant and most important they were easy to grow it became the food of nations but trouble was looming for the humble spud in the mid one hundred eighty ninth century potato blight annihilated crops nineteenth century
it was a fungus visible as century a black scab on the foliage of the plant but with rain would have dripped down into the soil and
this is very typical of the potatoes in the foothills of the andes where they still grow the old varieties because of their flavour and they tend to have this yellow flesh which has a flavour which is called umarmy it's the fifth flavour sensation on your tongue you have sweet sour salt builter and then umarmy which is a sensation that makes you want to eat more
it's importants mouth v. cardiff none have won the cup or indeed anything else really since the second world war
much has changed about the game since then phil tuffnell's pitted new clobber with havant and waterlooville we have always enjoyed a kill about hundreds of years ago the balls ranged from pig's bladders and stitched up cloth to human heads people called it football the beautiful game is far from being that gruesome today it's the world's most popular sport a multibillion pound industry and the kit has gone hi tech i'm going to join players at havant and waterlooville f. c. for a game but first i'm meeting peter evans from
yes this is a hand knitted one thousand eight hundred eighty one probably knitted by the mum or grandmum and it would have got wet and heavy and soaking it would have got very hot in the nicer weather
of this fantastic material called ecstatic and it keeps the player cool when it's hot keeps him warm when it's cold keeps him dry when it's wet and it's anti bacterial
the biggest difference is the
old we are in traditional nineteen forties gear with my team the havant football academy have the hi tech kit that my team members usually wear sean you boys were real heroes in anfield for the f. a. cup how do you think you will fare in this clobber
let's have a go come on boys
any tricks in them not that i can do any tricks and i think i've got nails in my feet l. wouldn't be surprised if i'm bleeding in there
this shirt's very very very hot couldn't see myself lasting ninety minutes and the shorts are very long the biggest thing is having something wrapped around your ankle
but i think tomorrow will be our day i'm predict ago three to zero
are you really fighting talk that's what i like your grandad wasn't born i suppose when cardiff were last there mark how do you feel
confident too it's the year of the underdog and portsmouth have knocked out manchester united and
it was either two to one to portsmouth or penalties i think l. think it was two to one to portsmouth
now as you know the producers on this show like to give us challenges specifically when they give us a very small amount of money and tell us to buy a used car then they set unbelievably hard tasks to do to see which one of us got the best deal yeah
this week for a top gear special they came up with a real humdinger they gave each of us one thousand five hundred quid and told us to go to africa and buy a car
can you open the door the handle's broken it's a lancia beta coupe nineteen eighty one the only lancia of any sort in the whole of botswana it's done twenty nine thousand miles
a little old lady and boy had she ragged it
that's uh yeah what's the piece of cardboard for mopping up moisture no that's because the battery shorts on the bonnet shorts on the bonnet right
you've done well so now what do you want a lift we left the lancia to cool down because hammond was arriving
ah
yeah what the hell have you done man it's an opel kadett from nineteen sixty three
so that's the same age as same age as me you
i love the speedo i do like a horizontal speedo i really do where's the engine it's there hang on
it's tiny
do you want to know about the power yes i do forty forty
forty horsepower well they did do a sport version with forty eight but i didn't want anything too lairy
you've both been idiots
no brilliantly interesting brilliantly stylish
but stupid why's mine stupid where is yours because well
a lancia you have been a bit thick
with the cars at the start line it was time for our challenge the people of surrey think they need four wheel drive cars because they live up a lane which sometimes has leaves on it you will now attempt to prove them wrong by driving your two wheel drive cars from here on botswana's eastern border with zimbabwe there zero point one miles to its western border with namibia that's right across the spine of africa
i'm confident
sorry sorry
the lancia wheezed into life and hammond and i set off in pursuit
if you think of the cars that this inspired it was latterly built in russia where it became the moscovitch which was rubbish and of course indirectly the vauxhall astra quite a lot of reasonably average cars owe themselves to this
i don't know if you know but africa is quite large and when you're out in a remote part you need a car like this that can be mended with a brick and a piece of string
what you have to remember is that three of the most rugged and successful rally cars ever made were lancias the stratos the o. thirty seven and the delta integrale lancia know how to make a rally car unfortunately on the day my beta coupe was made they obviously forgot everything the gearbox is broken the steering's broken the window's are broken in fact we all had problems
everything works except this knob which controls the blower
i've gotta have the windows open cos there's quite a strong smell of petrol
and that mirror which is actually slightly stuck
hazard warning lights the clock the fan the handbrake all of the dials
the brakes are terrible cos they only work on that wheel they work very well on that wheel but only on that wheel
that instrument's a bit wobbly but apart from that everything that's important works perfectly apart from the handbrake which i can pull as we go along
right i'm gonna overtake the truck here goes he's pulled out of its slipstream
it's really coming up one hundred five
still truck
pulls cleanly hang on a minute it's got no fifth gear someone's put the knob from a five gear model on it
this is just the happiest car in the world i shall call it oliver not that we'd ever name a car on top gear i wish i hadn't said that
it's not one thousand five in the morning and it's started to get quite hot i've got an idea oh yeah that's better
don't know what that is toots toot toot a horn toot toot oliver you've got a cold listen toot we were having fun but then we discovered we were travelling with bill oddie why've you got a pen to tick them off when you seen them
hornbill southern yellow billed i'm gonna look at your car it's massive
don't knock oliver don't knock my car that's a fine he's a fine
what did you call it then oliver's a friend of mine and i thought you were talking about him
he's given his car a name so far the journey had been a dawdle oh this is bad
i can see from here how hard the suspension on jeremy's lancia is having to work it's just a blur
come on oliver please
the later you book a lift in the mercedes the more expensive it gets like an airline
oh god oh i've broken engine isn't working it's cut out
oh dear
he's done literally one kilometre of this
i know what's wrong bonnet won't open yeah the bonnet catch shut up
hammond was tetchy cos he knew the price of failure anyone whose car broke down would have to complete the journey in a beetle it is collectively our least favourite car in the world yes it's the punishment
please hang on hang on ooh well done oliver
what did you say
oh my god what now my car's on fire but in a specific place
wow look at that it was your magnifying glass there's a laser beam coming through it it's like acid cardboard piece of cardboard's gone so it sets itself on fire if you don't have a piece of cardboard
we drove deeper and deeper into the bush lancia yeah what is that
looks like the sea
eventually the road disappeared altogether people of surrey i hope you're watching this we are driving a lancia beta coupe while just in the middle of whatever you call this the good news was we'd successfully reached our campsite for the night the bad news came in the shape of another challenge stretching before you is the makgadikgadi these are the biggest saltflats in the world they are almost as completely lifeless and as wide as portugal no car has ever driven across them if you run out of water you will die if your car breaks down and you can't be rescued you will die if you run out of food you will die it's like driving on a creme brulee there's a primeval ooze covered with a thin layer of salty crust if you have thin tyres you will break through that crust get stuck and you will die so we'd advise you to fit fat tyres and remove as much weight as possible before setting off how hard can it be
don't say that
in camp the weight shedding began ready
like your work argh
fuel filler i'll need that maybe i don't want to take the hubcaps off really because they protect the hubs
can i point something out what hammond's walking round his car muttering about how he needs all of it
i know exactly what he's doing
he's formed an emotional attachment hasn't he
it'd be like saying to him could you cut bits off your wife
what are you doing
i was going to take the radiator grille off on the basis it's just an ornament can i help please do do you want your windows out no no they're fine i've worked that out
this'll be old glass very thin glass
very thin
god they come off easily james yes using nothing but a hammer yes
here's your beer thank you mate have we lost enough weight now
you haven't lost an ounce
i've lost a spare wheel and something else
look at mine it'll need guide ropes to stop it floating away like a balloon
so tomorrow we die no i think it's like all these things exaggerated
we'll be fine honestly we've done enough
the next morning on the edge of the saltpans we thought we'd come under attack from a bond villain but it turned out to be the vice president of botswana that is a cool ride yeah it is it's better than an official rover seventy five and a couple of policemen he was amazed to hear what was being planned
i've just never known anyone to go across in a car this'll be the first time i think
there they are oh really
oh really yes that should be interesting
nothing really prepares you for the sheer size of these
i think in a way that it's more frightening than the pole you can see the curvature of the earth
as we ploughed on the little opel was going well oliver is just skipping boo this car was born to do this
i'm looking at james's rear wheel and he's digging in a long way
i tried to help him along
well there's always the beetle james
it's waiting for you what are you going to do it's sinking
how far's that a mile
if that
my lancia waded in again'
just a nudge that's a crash
argh argh
this was hopeless so we had to rope in the camera crew
three two one
because the ooze was so bad we had to get even more drastic with the weight shedding we toiled away for hours'
oh god
another modification ha ha ha ha
this is excellent
come on oh oh oh yes
no this isn't good
oh no
only the opel remained trouble free which was bad news for me
yes come on man i'll go forward hammond and we'll do it again hang on
how far is it
keep going keep going keep going yes yes no james don't go there you'll get stuck
that's close
come on can we have everybody and we'll push it off we need one hundred men or more no
this is hopeless
people of surrey you need four wheel drives for this bit the gung was so sticky it had completely jammed the lancia's rear wheels
i can't describe you just think it's just mud do you know what it is
fish it's just rotted prehistoric fish one two three mercifully the ground eventually hardened and we made good progress then suddenly the horizon was no longer flat
this is interesting cos we're coming between what looked like islands i suppose they are as this was a lake
amazing absolutely amazing
where are we it's an island
we're about a third of the way across
and you've been stuck about one thousand times
that is smug is that a baobab tree i've always wanted to see one of those hammond look at this whoa it is just about the most astonishing place i've ever been
i'm with you there
as the sun set we headed for the campsite day two on the saltpans and we'd been told that today our problem would not be mud but dust that meant james and i had to rethink our wardrobe solutions' i've teamed up with a bin liner v. necked the last time i wore one of these i went to see the clash frankly i thought it was all a bit much i mean how bad could this dust be my eyes
i can't even see jezzer already
oh no no no no no
the headgear's come off hello
i had to close this at one point back that much and then it pulls the air out and you get fresh air it's nice
you know what it's like when someone punches you really hard in the face i do then the surface got even worse argh it was like we were descending through the seven circles of hell no i'd assumed it'd be the salts that would kill the notoriously rust prone lancia but it was rough going even though it had now smoothed out again the beta was in a bad way i've gone i've gone
you can't get out i've got no power no drive do you remember what the man said jeremy breakdown and you have a nice time no die
well that's loose that's hot it is a good job they counted this engine over by twenty degrees cos that means it's small and inaccessible than it would have otherwise have look at this
i've got to say it has been nice the peace you know not having him around
i've checked the alternator the spark plugs the h. t. leads and the distributor cap poked around with the starter solenoid there's been faults with all of them but it still isn't going i'm not sure which i favour most here certain death or that beetle nnnngg come off oh for god's sake i honestly believe it's had it
is my car on the crab no it's tracking true mate
he's worried about tracking and look at it we knew that jeremy would eventually catch us up but what would he be driving i can see something in the mirrors please let it be a beetle i do hope it's a beetle please please let it be a beetle please let it be a beetle
i'm back
oh jeremy well done i'm disa sorry delighted
you're not in a beetle
not a beetle a fully functioning lancia beta coupe
i just wanted the beetle to pounce on you when you were straying behind i'm gutted
shall we just sandwich him james
no with our convoy back up to strength we pressed on apart from jeremy being bill oddie occasionally
flamingos breed out here
so that's breeding is it
it's a fossil it's not it only died about two years ago i was talking about you
it's an ex flamingo it is no hey no look what now
i know what created this ostrich yes it's legs are miles apart
that's exactly how it was walking
you know david attenborough's about to retire
can i just say what you look like a gay cowboy and you look like a gay terrorist
you look like a terrorist with a broken windscreen wiper and your face is ridiculous then hammond started to pick on my car
why haven't you turned it off it's gathering electricity so if you turn it off the battery's not going to start again turn it off and start it then yeah go on let's have some beautiful silence
are you ready yes are you ready yes behold
why did you turn it off you idiot because he said it would
good luck mate somebody will give you a jump start don't go away goodbye
annoyingly clarkson got the lancia going again and then we came across some big birds
wow
and then we saw even more wildlife there's a cow two cows three cows
yes we've done it we had crossed the makgadikgadi trees life mate did you ever think that you'd do that
i'm genuinely proud of him i am
really i'm startled that this it isn't a car any more whatever it is has done it with its low profile tyres and its low suspension that's broken
i'm absolutely delighted because the makgadikgadi is one of the most unpleasant places i've ever been it's just a big bowl of dust hello mate
widow twanky may have been glad to see the back of the saltpans but despite this they gave us a startling parting gift
gasp wow that is amazing that's the moon yeah that's the moon
because of the dust from the pans you get a moonrise
and in orange i've got goosebumps i know a philip larkin poem about the moon would you like to hear it
no
as a new day dawned our cars looked like wrecks but their ordeal was far from over yes we had crossed the saltpans but we were still only a third of the way across botswana and now we were about to enter the kalahari the kalahari everyone who comes to the kalahari takes away a different memory of it the savagery the simplicity the vast heat me i think bumpiness it was as rough as hell so we were glad when news came through that we were to stop at the next village
obviously they recognise a truly classy car
what could they possibly have in mind for us here it was another challenge
eh hello here it is
your cars have travelled far and suffered much yes they have so we will now discover how much performance they've lost in a competition against the clock on a rally special stage
my car never lost any performance it never had any that's true
i'm not going to ruin my mercedes just for a few points
you're right you're not because you're not driving it well who is some say he's seen the lion king one thousand seven hundred eighty times and that his second best friend is a cape buffalo all we know is he's not the stig but he is the stig's african cousin
wow
he's protected the important bits
keen to get going the three of us fired up our engines well when i say three
it's absolutely dead there isn't nothing is functioning there is no electrical you two are not being helpful no
what a stupid thing to say
interior light headlight nothing
it was a long shot
it was a long shot
yeah
'. and we drove to african stig's rally stage which was in a dried up river bed a few miles away with packed spectator stands' moo oliver went first
look at that it does look ridiculous is the word you're looking for
as the kadett struggled to get up the hill the spectators left
he's making a job of being the stig's cousin he's enjoying that
and one minute twelve seconds
that's a good benchmark for you to try and beat
next up was the panzer tank most powerful longest best tyres slowest longest
longest is good for rallying is it it is on this yeah so why on loose surface rallies don't they turn up with intercity trains go yeah that's the most ridiculous spectacle i've ever seen in my entire life a mercedes with no bonnet no front wings no doors
in the hands of african stig though it was flying that is the latest in a long line of pedigree mercedes benz sports cars
there's never been a mercedes rally car
ah yours is flying up the hill mate look at it go
you wait till you see the lancia it will dance through there
great oh yes oh it's out of control no
that's a big slide one minute six i'll just do my ancients
i hate you gloating no let him do it it's like winning a semifinal
time now to put james in his place because the lancia was on home turf with its rally pedigree stratos oh three seven what
that's not dust it's on fire
get out and turn it off
stopwatch still running forty five seconds
we'll replace the seal
there'll be some difficulty he's off maybe he's started start the stopwatch
i think he was in a hurry so he decided not to take your car hey jeremy
what you were right though your engine it's canted
those are the fuel cans
the problem was that richard's car and mine ran on leaded fuel which was incredibly hard to find and it was no use turning to the film crew for help diesel diesel diesel and two stroke diesel guys it's diesel and two stroke
the town of maun was about sixty miles away and with little fuel we would have to go there as the crow flies now we really would see how they'd cope off road we have to try and keep the distance down to save what fuel we've got
oof these thorns are incredible
look at that they look like cocktail sticks growing out of them
take cover ow
once again the forty four year old opel absolutely shone go on little fella yah with our precious fuel burning away we carved out the straightest path possible guys do you know what we're driving through
plants
no this is a weed it grows locally and it's a hallucinogenic
bluuuuuh
if any car was going to get stuck we'd have put money on the lancia but no all right mate sorry
which year was it made
nineteen eighty one it's just driven all the way from zimbabwe to here without going on a road like this yeah may
get out the way of the pump
i shall move for you if you ask politely i will move it
yeah that's his light they are grown ups honestly they do this a lot
we were now just over halfway and amazingly our cars were still running all of them the next day in the centre of maun we got our next challenge this is it the golden envelope you will drive your cars to namibia through the okavango delta
that's the really big wildlife place in the okavango you will encounter many deadly animals
including lions leopards cheetahs hyenas wild dogs hippos black rhino and crocodiles birds snakes shieldnose snakes puff adders cape cobras banded cobras black mambas black widows and thick tailed scorpions
what about the honey badger
the what honey badger
that's the least scary sounding animal in the world
a honey badger does not kill to eat you it tears off your testicles it does not
why is it called a honey badger exactly that's what made it angry
why isn't it called the badger of death
in order to protect ourselves from the lions and honey badgers jeremy and i would have to rebuild our cars but because we'd left all the bits on the other side of the saltpans we had to use whatever we could find
could a lion eat this grrr
who do i see about the corrugated metal
oh there's a lion coming what shall i do that oliver will protect me because i had nothing to do i decided to irritate jeremy
i've got to go to that tarpaulin man
tarpaulin tarpaulin will defeat a honey badger that's well known it's well known for its almost military protective capabilities that's why you see people going into war zones draped in tarpaulin
could you put a new door on a car come and have a look it's not sophisticated metalwork this but
i would like a tarpaulin roof for a lancia beta coupe nineteen eighty one right
we can make anything
do you have any lion proof tarpaulin this thick
yeah
one and a half metres by one and a half metres
if you think of a lion door it'd be about that big could you ignore him and make me that
because mercedes were very popular in africa james soon found a spare door and boot lid for his car and while he was looking for more bits i hatched a plan
that's a cow's head
yeah now this will attract flies it'll make his life unpleasant it will also attract lions tigers
he effectively becomes a burger van driving and to make sure the lions didn't miss that's a whopper a good piece
under this seat
ooh the smell will really beautiful we also attached a cow bell to the underside of his car but while we were doing this he was making merry with the paint that afternoon we left maun and headed north to the okavango delta
right my car now has been readied as you can see i have a wooden door here it's a gull wing so i can get in and out obviously
this is like being in an allotment shed on a very windy day
on the left i have all the cans that were in the car from the last few days and the piece de resistance badgers go away i am the road warrior mad jeremy it's a police car
can anybody else smell burning or is it my car
is it like a barbecue smell
as we neared the okavango the roads became rougher and rougher this is where the benz comes into its own it's got good ground clearance bloody hell
this is enough to shake the skulls from your bonnet and nobody in the whole of human history has ever said that before
so just to summarise viewers as we went through the gates and into the game reserve the road changed again for the worse
this is new very soft sand
to stop our cars bogging down we had to drive as fast as possible and we had ourselves another rally stage amazingly even jeremy had his work cut out keeping up with the opel
hammond's car's looking so composed i'm developing this irrational hatred of him and it
this is such a good game
eventually he was slowed down by a bridge
colonel bogey march
this is where wildlife cameramen come to make a name for themselves with david attenborough but unfortunately our crew are best really with cars
a giraffe on the right there the big thing
if we ever do a programme called the back end of an animal these are the boys to hire
this week on too late to look
a baboon on the left with a baby on its back
to give our crew a chance we stopped and discovered that we weren't much good at animals either
wow look look
a hippo's head oh it is
it's probably a whole hippo the rest of him is under the water
what does a hippo do just before it attacks
opens its mouth opens its mouth
it can open its jaw there's a thing it can do
ah look ah look at that
they've stopped for a drink using their noses to shovel water into their mouths
jeremy that's a rubbish commentary james took over
that one's lifting its paw up a bit like a dog does paw hoof foot whatever you call it
hoof what is it on an elephant
there is a man over there with the best comb over i have ever seen in my life
that is he's got four partings as a result of that can you see why you're bald
live with it he caught me looking at him i was looking through the binoculars
i was looking at the elephants really look at that sun now boys elephants rally special stage best comb over i've seen everything's here
we camped by the river and while james serviced his car i hatched a plan jeremy jeremy jeremy what quick come here come here
that's a cow's head yeah it wasn't working in the boot
i've had a better idea what tent his tent yeah love your thinking second one from the right that's his
in in in
put it under his bed
what what was that it was a hippo
hippos spend all day in water yes and then they come out at night because i can't remember why
do you want to go out there with a hippopotamus or do you want to stay in here with a horse's head
that's not a question not a horse a cow um hang on that's my bag in james's te this is my tent oh man get it out
our starting point at the zimbabwe border felt like it was in another time zone but still there were many miles of delta to cover and our cars were in a really bad way the bush mechanic we have on the team took two cubic feet of sand our of my carburettor last night and asked if i wouldn't mind driving a more slowly today
hahaha james's cowbell
our second hand road cars were getting more out of their depth this is proper off roading now men in camouflage trousers in wales who like murdering people at weekends would say this is tough going
it was a whole thunk oh what is it it's like iron it's a tree root i think i've bent the steering back a bit wow
wow there is an elephant right there
a door down that would stop an elephant
soon our route was blocked by a river and what you're supposed to do is wade in to check the depth right jeremy made us drive on until he got bored
here no what no
a agree with him for once cos that reedy stuff must mean it's shallow
it's shallow where the reeds are you fool we'll drive over to them you've got to drive through the water first we can't keep going
we've done thirty miles i'm frustrated cos you can't just drive into a river because you're bored
i do a fair bit of off roading and i know that's not the place to go across you're wrong
i'm going through here are you going to carry on
so edging fan belts off fan belts off is a good idea
it'll splash water into the distributor james went first and i said i'd watch for crocodiles oh i say there's a ground hornbill over there
thunderbird one to the rescue
come on i'm sinking by the boughs coming
argh no i can't help you come on james i'm in a low sprung sports car i'm going down
that's good yes
there's water coming in to my car i've got a wet bottom we're through both our cars were flooded by our guides weren't bothered at all people of surrey if this happens to you water in the footwell and you need to drain it out you're gonna need a hole the people of botswana have a tip for you
hammond how's it going well i got a bit of water in him we did as well but it doesn't matter using rifles we shot the car so the water's drained out it's brilliant good
i might need the rifle as a local tourist truck pulled me out the laughing hyenas arrived may gave his diagnosis'
starting from the top the battery's probably knackered and then the carburettor would be flooded working down the distributor cap will be full of water the engine itself if a bit of water went into the cylinders you might've broken something the oil will be ruined i know i'll fix him
you are going to try and mend this if you leave me to it yeah so we did
all by myself don't wanna be all by my
oh that's harsh that is quite harsh but go on
are you sure you've had enough
oh he'll like this one
sad so sad it's a sad sad situation
unfortunately you can only give a man so much sympathy so james and i went ahead to make camp hammond knew that in the morning if his beloved oliver wasn't fixed he'd have to leave him behind so he got our bush mechanic to bring the generator down and worked on through the night morning came and still no hammond i'm knackered today i mean i feel quite like an explorer is that hammond
is it a beetle more to the point
no way no way
oh yeah yeah he's back ah and here's the best thing do you remember the horn which was rubbish
it's excellent
ah
is that technically possible probably not in forty seven years i've never been speechless with all the cars defying all the odds we began our final push to the border
my car is working perfectly as usual
i've got no brakes the pedal goes straight to the floor and i have to de clutch to stop i'm using the handbrake
hah the lancia could beat that every time i brake it spears off to the right and i'm unable to steer left to correct that this has now gone from being a nuisance to being downright dangerous
we soon reached the end of the okavango so we pulled over to remove the animal protection and then guess what the lancia simply would not get going again it won't start because the starter solenoid has packed up but when it was running it wouldn't move off in any of the gears
beetle
i'll push it
is this a good time to acknowledge that mine is the only one that has worked consistently no this is worrying i need to be home by saturday i've been invited to a beetle drive
the entire crew was working on the stricken beta until we were rewarded with the most glorious sound in the world life it lives it lives i got a whole hundred yards oh i'm not stuck the idle speed's not good bye everybody i can't stop please please
soon we hit the tarmac and we started to taste the hope just twenty miles you can do that you've crossed botswana
i'm stuck in second but second will do
come on ten miles please then something really surprising happened
oh no not now please because the lancia had been such a problem child everyone was fed up with it only two of the crew stayed behind to help carburettor's gone even if we can get that fixed the starter motor has gone we put it into gear it goes into third and that just stalls the engine
come on
the border
sorry i've got no brakes um yeah
it's there
we've done it all we had to do now was wait wait to see which car jeremy arrived in is that an engine it's a car the unmistakable clatter of a vehicle engine it's gonna be the beetle
and it was but i wasn't driving it yeah
i'm almost pleased yeah
oh that's excellent
watch the brakes don't work sorry there's no brakes
congratulations
that's astonishing
i think realistically we have to say the lancia's won it why um
by what possible measure it's the most surprising it's the worst

no you may not and stop trying to take advantage of the situation and you get over it it's only the human body
and yes yes and why not it was very um on an aesthetic level i can see why you'd enjoy why didn't you just lock the door
you mean with the lock i keep asking you to fix but you keep putting off
yes that lock

here's one of me neighbour in her dressing gown putting out her bin bag there's one of her hitting me with the bin bag that's the duty solicitor
listen jimmy you've been through a traumatic experience the best thing for you to do is talk about it in detail slowly
what is wrong with you
it's been a while for me jimmy
she is my mother in law
yes but you have to admit she's a very attractive woman
i don't care if she's scarlett johannsen she's my mother in law
well maybe you could just draw what you saw
please can we just talk about something else sure fine
no problem was she dripping wet or just kind of glistening
relax mum in law's the word
hi handsome we still on for tonight
well i'll assume you're referring to me and so the answer is yes
so what are you boys talking about
naked women what i didn't say you saw diana naked
thanks kev
you saw diana naked
it's nothing i accidentally walked in on her when she was in the shower
accidentally are you sure because some people say there's no such thing as an accident
then how would you explain kev
that's hurtful
you're hurt he's two timing me with his mother in law ex mother in law x. rated mother in law
you're enjoying this
yeah question is did you
siobhan all right i'm sorry i'll make up for it later really yeah really if you play your cards right you may get to see two naked women in the same day

gran's in the kitchen she's fully dressed
dad you're just in time i got the results of my test back i'm about to find out how i'll spend the rest of my life oh you open it i'm too excited my destiny is in your hands
relax alex it's just a test
well what thrilling adventures await
accountancy
very funny ha ha what does it really say
accountancy accountancy ha ha
sorry
dear god this can't be
there are worse things than being an accountant name one i can't right now
i was supposed to be destined for greater things to leave my mark to change the world to date supermodels
well you can still do those things some of those things well one of them at least i don't expect you to understand you're a builder i'd rather be a builder than an ac you see
well i'd better go and start counting things like reasons to live that's the spirit
you handled that really well you are such a good father
just tell me what you want
all right i need fifty for the tattoo
i don't think you should be getting a tattoo
oh well if you put it that way no
fine but if you don't give me the money i'll end up in some cut price back street tattoo parlour where they use un sterilised needles i'll probably get hepatitis c. or lose an arm to gangrene no biggie
i'll think about it oh thank you thank you i just said i will think about it
yes but we both know it's only a matter of time
i'm entering the kitchen diana jimmy something smells good thank you
i'm making a risotto i got the recipe from the naked chef
very funny i got a new lock so you don't have to worry about any more accidents
i'm not worried no no me neither then why can't you look at me
i am looking at you really yeah just so that you know i won't be in for dinner i'm going round to siobhan's
who are you talking to jimmy i sense that you're still feeling embarrassed about seeing me
embarrassed me no what makes you say that
you're addressing the wall
and it seems fine
this is ridiculous just look at me
that wasn't so hard
i'll go and fix this lock
the look of love is in your eyes the look
i'm sorry it's diana i can't get the image out of my head
well why don't you try thinking about something that um you really really like
i meant me oh plenty of time see that's not helping well wake me then if you have any sudden urges
well actually you're not eating crisps in bed
something's troubling you i can tell look at the way you're handling that nail gun there's no joy in it i hate seeing you like this boss cold distant unresponsive it's like when i asked for that pay rise
it's diana i've got the image of her etched into my brain
memories fade boss you have to give it time
it's starting to effect other things last night with siobhan i couldn't watch the telly
that's terrible
i was really up for it you know and it was my favourite programme and it was right there on the screen practically begging me to watch it i couldn't
you wanna get yourself sky plus you can stop halfway and come back to it
forget it
i know you need to see something else so shocking that it completely wipes away that image you know like scaring you out of the hiccups
what could possibly get that image out of my head other than going to war
oh this is bad boss
not now and i appreciate your concern but i'll be fine
not that you just nail gunned my foot to the floor
oh kev this is horrible but it's no good i can still see her
ah ahh i didn't know you were interested in butterflies
i'm very interested i'm thinking about getting one there
absolutely not you're not having an insect imprinted on your body for all the world to see fine what about a transfer
i've thought of that but what family would have you dad gran won't let me have the tattoo even though you said i could
is that true jimmy a tattoo may be the sort of youthful idiocy your father might excuse as free expression but i won't stand for it
come on diana you can't tell me you never did anything like this when you were molly's age
what do you mean by that
i'm just saying we've all done things we regret
molly could you give me a moment alone with your father
can i leave too
go ahead say it say what the other day when you walked in on me you saw it
well yes i saw it
i'm not proud of it
it seemed normal to me
i have regretted that tattoo ever since i got it
ah a tattoo
what on earth did you think we were talking about
i'd rather not say
it was on my hip surely you noticed
i thought that was a birth mark so what is it a unicorn a flaming skull sir anthony eden
do you want me to show you again no diana i'll pay you not to
so has the jury reached a verdict on the tattoo yet
they're still deciding
as your accountant i'd advise you to forgo the body art and put the money into a high interest retirement account estimating conservatively a return of fifty five per cent over the next forty years oh my god i'm so boring
no more boring than usual
i never said i was perfect you have repeatedly the point is we all do stupid things when we're young i remember when my daughter married you
it's the flaming skull isn't it
if you must know it's a rose
a rose so it's all right for you to have a tattoo but not for molly
that's what i've been telling you
i don't want molly to get a tattoo either but how can we stop her if i tell her not to do something she just does it all the more
we could make that work for us a bit of reverse psychology
brilliant molly dear
good news we've talked it over and
we think you should get the tattoo whatever you want we're all for it in fact have two
oh great thank you
molly could you give us another moment
how many moments do you need
that isn't quite what i meant
well maybe we should just try being honest tell molly about your floral display
fine molly look what seems cool to you now may not seem as cool to you in ten years even less in thirty years believe it or not when i was young i got a tattoo
it's a rose
what i'm trying to say is that it was a mistake a mistake that i've regretted every day since do you understand what i'm trying to tell you yeah
i'm getting a tattoo i'm getting a tattoo
the look of love is in your eyes
are you ready
i've been ready for about five minutes
well you'd better be
you'll never guess what i found out about diana
jimmy
is that a rose
yes do you like it
i've stopped being ready
what's wrong
diana has a rose tattoo right get out can't we at least talk about it
nope here you are kev thanks
i'd like another coke oh it's all about your needs isn't it all i said was i'd like another coke
what's she mean by that boss
eum ooh kev could you just grab me that bowl of nuts
sure
you act as if this is somehow my fault which it is but i can't help it
admit it you can't stop thinking about her why not sleep with her and get it over with
you can't seriously believe i'm interested in diana
well you don't seem to be very interested in me
there you go boss thanks
oh you couldn't grab me a couple of those napkins could you
all right but i am in a lot of pain you know ah
look maybe i just need a little more time
why are you so uncomfortable she's not even your mother in law now
i know unless you still have feelings for anne what it's got nothing to do with that i would be just as uncomfortable if i saw your mother naked
really yes oh that's all i wanted to hear
but please don't make me prove it
actually can i get one of those i'm starting to bleed
look i'm sorry i'm sorry i shouldn't have got so upset
no i'm sorry i shouldn't have well no i should have but well you know what i mean
ooh don't look now diana's here
diana where
where did you come from
how does my hair look
jimmy we need to talk hello
hello how about a drink on the house for the lovely lady
that's kind of you i'll have a brandy
excellent choice
he's so friendly yes
yes he was saying the other day how he'd like to see more of you
good news did you know that it's illegal for minors to get tattoos molly won't be able to get one regardless of what we say
so we don't have to be the bad guys exactly
they crush her dreams and we act supportive and disappointed it's a win win scenario
here's your drink thank you the other one's from kev
oh
compliments of the gentleman at the bar
my goodness this is a friendly pub you told them you saw me naked
it may have slipped out
jimmy how could you
well you said it was no big deal
oh my god they're all undressing me with their eyes
no they're not
well as long as you didn't mention the tattoo
i'll show you mine if you show me yours
right i think i'll just be going listen you lot put your eyes back in their sockets you should be ashamed of yourselves
alex why are you getting letters from old people's homes
oh i decided to skip the accounting and go straight to retirement i tried to embrace it i even went to an accounting firm to see what it was all about i had to leave too depressing no security threw me out
busy day ahead then oh yeah got cash in the attic a little nap then diagnosis murder alex i don't mind you watching this stuff but please don't circle them in t. v. quick
ooh could you turn the heating up the cold gets right into my bones
what's that
you feeling sorry for yourself because of a stupid test i hate to say this but i miss the old alex
i miss him too boiled sweet
just because some test says you should become an accountant doesn't mean you have to be alex you are special
do you mean that
special in many many ways
thanks and i'll tell you something else my careers advisor said
i should become a doctor but that is not what i became
so you could have been a well paid highly respected medical professional what happened
that's not the point the point is you can be anything you want to be
you're right dad i could be prime minister
well yes or something in sales
thanks dad i feel like a new man i'm keeping the big slipper though it's really comfy good news gran i don't have to be an accountant elephant trainer is back on the table
lovely or something in sales
and how long have you been lurking there
i'm rather proud of you at the moment don't spoil it i feel like a cup of tea would you like one
i think we should celebrate it's so rare to see you exhibit good parenting skills
was this supposed to be a compliment
tell me did your careers advisor really say you should be a doctor
no he said i was suited for building work
oh well played
hi kev oh right er no you wait in the van i'll be out in a minute yes yes i will ask her kev says if your plumbing's out and you need a shower the water pressure at his
there's not enough water pressure in the world
i hate my life
here she is here's my girl so let's see the new tattoo
yes how's the tattoo you can forget about the tattoo they wouldn't give me one
i'll look after this until you're eighteen
by then i'll be able to get a real one
well miss wanda william wilberforce i hope you've learned a valuable lesson
exactly and you can't get a tattoo unless you're an adult yes and that yeah
but you can get your belly button pierced look
how could you let this happen me yes if it wasn't for you even entertaining the idea of a tattoo she wouldn't have mutilated her belly button
oh come on its just a little belly piercing inky hips
give me that biscuit oh what a shame there isn't a doctor in the house
tell you what kev it's like a circus freak show back there tattooed lady the amazing perforated girl corky the elephant boy of course there's no prizes for guessing who's gonna have to are you all right yeah boss
good thing i was wearing a seat belt
i wish you were wearing more than that
i was just trying to help you get the other image out of your head
what seems to be the er problem
look it's not what you think
i dunno i've got a vivid imagination
you see there was a wasp in the van and it made me swerve into the lamp post
what about that one
the impact of the crash made his clothes fly off
i find that very difficult to believe
thought you said you had a vivid imagination let me handle this
you see he was having problems sexually
please please just arrest me the look of love
are you sure you're ready
oh don't you worry about me i am cured diana has been driven out by the sight of kev totally naked apart from the seatbelt you could see everything warts and all i mean my insurance will go up but what the heck so come here you
oh no don't touch me
what's wrong
er well now i'm not in the mood
this time tony and jon hit the water on a tree planting assignment
the most unusual consultancy that i'm doing
jon dresses up to tackle some dangerous customers
do i look like a spaceman
and tony has a surprise lift off
we're right off the ground now
tony kirkham's in charge of fourteen thousand trees in the royal botanic gardens kew
i want to make trees matter to people today
together with his best tree climber jon hammerton tony is on a mission to discover whether in the early years of the twenty first century we still value the trees that made britain across the country trees are under attack on all fronts
one thing we've noticed whilst making this series is that trees are under threat from climate from infection and from people like never before
the combined forces of climate change and development mean established trees are being lost at an unprecedented rate these horse chestnut trees are in the way of a large development and unless someone can come up with an alternative they face the chainsaw
in this programme we're going off to see the extraordinary lengths that people go to to save trees we're gonna come back later with a radical solution to this one
trees provide shelter and shade they clean the air and they improve the quality of life for people who live around them in the face of winter storms warming summers and creeping urban sprawl tony's keen to see if there are people prepared to go the extra mile to make sure future generations enjoy the trees that we take for granted tony and jon are heading to the far north of england the lake district is nearly nine hundred square miles of national park which should be protection enough for cumbria's trees but tony has come across some tree fanatics with a very unusual problem right jon
this is gonna be good fun today
the trees on windermere's famous islands are under threat violent storms are eroding the fourteen islands causing them to disintegrate the windermere canoe and kayak company have just become voluntary custodians of the lake's second biggest island thompson holme and have called tony and jon for help
this is the most unusual consultancy that i'm gonna be doing anyway it's going to be interesting
to save the trees they need to save the island and tony has one simple suggestion plant more trees so the roots will hold the island together
this is one of the trees is it
it is that's a really nice specimen it is obviously it's a native oak tree
yeah tony's being helped by steve tatlock national park ranger for windermere thank you do you know how to hold these properly
stick the paddle on your head you should make two right angles
like a tree
matt stidson from the canoe company will be responsible for looking after the trees on the island and will show them the way
well i normally go in a van to do my work
you look like pocahontas in that hat everybody's talking at me i don't hear a word they're sayin' only the echoes of my mind
on their way to thompson holme steve shows tony what's happening to the islands of windermere and the lake's trees
yeah this is what i'd call severe water logging problems yeah
so really the island we're going to now to plant a tree it's really trying to prevent this happening absolutely yeah
all right jonny
land ahoy
before they start planting tony kew's tree expert has got to prove his worth
steve set us a task actually a challenge there's an american tree on this island most of them are british natives like beech and oak and he's set us a task of finding it but it's deciduous so it could be well hidden
while it doesn't take tony long to find the tree
found it over here naming it proves a little more difficult i think this is the american one and it's there in the back of my mind and it'll pop out in a minute its full name
you'll have to use english names
not a snowbell tree it's not a snowbell tree a snowdrop tree no snow yeah go on what snow snowy
i've forgotten it as well
snowy snowy
while tony is struggling someone else has come up with a suggestion
i think it's amelanchier
it could be amelanchier yeah snowy mespilus
that's the one well done jon you're impressed by that
i am yeah i'm very impressed
with that problem solved it's time to get planting the new tree to help safeguard the island against erosion
this is the business oh he's given me the spade if you're the custodian you'll be on here planting trees in the future it's critical you get it right so i think if you have this spade
ooh that's hard plenty of roots down there
that's the turf coming off isn't it look at that
doing the business there matt d'you wanna give her a go
now the other basic principle of tree planting is you've got a nursery mark and that's known as a hypocotyl it's where the trunk joins the roots
a different coloration can you see the colour
that must be at soil level what if it's not at the soil level imagine when this tree's planted and you get a wind when they sway like this they flex at this collar and when they flex at the collar that tells a tree to put more roots on i understand but if you plant it too deep it can't flex and so it never really establishes if you get that planting depth right then they'll roar away right matt it looks really good what you're doing is excellent you're planting for the future and i think if you carry on doing what you're doing you'll have a good island for years
thank you for your help and advice you're welcome
thanks come back any time let's get back before that rain comes sounds good to me let's go
having helped save thompson holme island and its trees for the future tony and jon are heading south though saving a tree is never easy for most people the battle doesn't involve canoes and islands a tree preservation order gives a tree the full protection of the law getting an order is something anyone can do with a little know how and perserverance in harvington park in beckenham kent stands an atlantic cedar local resident wendy gowlett has known the tree for twenty five years
i really couldn't bear to see the area without it it so impacts on the entrance to the harvington estate i don't know a huge amount about trees but we love this tree
this giant cedar is very close to the lodge which was recently put up for sale wendy's fear was someone choosing to buy the building in the future might be less keen on the century old tree with nothing preventing it from being cut down wendy decided to act
what are you doing wendy to save this tree
well i knew a little about tree preservation orders so we approached the council in the view to hopefully having a tree preservation put on the tree
it's great people get so passionate about them and fight to keep 'em
for a tree to be eligible for a preservation order it must be highly visible to the public but if it's dead dying or dangerous it won't qualify so jon's got some treetop detective work to do
so i'll just do a bit of filming just checking this side out nah it's all pretty safe
so how's it looking jon it was just like any old cedar in the gardens falling down no
clean bill of health
good news with the cedar given the all clear the planning officer
can give wendy the news she's been waiting for
so there you go wendy tree one the atlantic cedar is safe are you pleased
very pleased yes it's made me very happy
you can sleep now i shall continue to come here and enjoy it
wahey oh and it hit it
here's to wendy and coral
and here's to our tree yeah cheers cheers cheers cheers coral thank you
you don't get one of these with every tree preservation order by the way just in case that's what you're thinking
but not every tree has someone like wendy to be its champion epping forest district borders london and the pressure on trees from urban sprawl is increasing jon stokes from the tree council has invited tony and jon to see a solitary black poplar near waltham abbey this tree was surrounded by many others but is a lone survivor standing on the edge of a housing estate
this is a you know fantastic tree growing in the middle of a housing estate next to the motorway so how do you protect it you've got to get people to feel that this is part of their heritage this is something they should value
chris neilan tree officer for epping forest district has come up with a novel way of getting people to stand up for trees like this solitary poplar and tony and jon are part of his plans
we get the people of the district to nominate their favourite trees and they've been doing that what we need help with is to get the best ones the ones that you choose will be declared the fifty favourite trees of epping forest district and we hope that that will help us save them like this tree obviously needs a bit of work so it doesn't break up in the next wind well now we know about it we can help do something about it but there are others out there as well and i suppose we can't do everything we need to know which ones we should concentrate on
so it's a kind of pop idol for trees yeah
here's the book with them all in
we'll go away digest these and come and give you a hand brilliant
having studied over one hundred fifty entries sent in response to chris' public appeal tony and jon have come to the local museum in waltham abbey to join the judging panel they have to whittle down the entries to the winning fifty
jon and i like the horse chestnut
well maybe we should shift that to the maybes
a definite yes
it's not as easy as this on pop idol is it
i've got a problem with this one guys
there's a bit of competition there we might be voting all those for the oak you're happy aren't you i am
one that had two nominations was the black poplar on the old royal ordnance site
the black poplar that tony and jon saw is up for nomination
if we gave it some credit and put it into the top fifty will it give it a bit of clout
it does yeah
i think it should go on then
while the judges seem to agree on most nominations there's one tree proving a bit of a sticking point
well i also looked very hard at this tree in the school and i felt that you know three hundred fifty kids can't be wrong really
looked at objectively it's an ordinary oak isn't it
at the same time this is about public involvement this is about the future
is this a definite yes or a definite no or a maybe
we're obviously we're all unsure here i think jon and i have to go and have a look at this and see it i think the photographs aren't really giving us a feel we've got to go and see it maybe meet
the tree in question is in the thomas willingale school in loughton tony and jon have come to meet the head mrs. smith
hello hello mrs. smith
we heard there was a lot more to this tree than what we were reading
well have a look at this brilliant absolutely wonderful the best moment for all of us
this tree it was under threat
the tree is one hundred eighty five metres away from a house and there was some suggestion that it was causing subsidence and that meant that we were sent a letter asking to cut it down the children were really quite determined nobody would cut it down
this is a school that's passionate about trees it's named after thomas willingale famous in the nineteenth century for saving epping forest from development by big landowners continuing in his footsteps mrs. smith is determined to help save her oak by getting it into the top fifty
i mean do the residents fear you the neighbours we've heard you've got a fiery reputation when it comes to trees
i'm very enthusiastic and i do follow what i think is right and um i'm very determined as well
does mrs. smith teach you all about trees in the classes yeah and do you come out and have your lessons under here as well
our first ever science lesson we came to this tree
so you'll always remember science from this tree
yeah great
i wish i had my lessons under trees
as the rest of year six come to find out what's going on with their precious tree jon decides to head into the branches
yeah tony thinks he's the headmaster now he's taken control
and we've come to have a look at this tree and see if it's worthy of going in the top spot qualifying for the top fifty so do you all want it to qualify yes
but jon isn't the only wildlife in this old oak it's a squirrel
a squirrel a squirrel dropped
it's a good healthy tree from here good there's no decay a few bits of dead wood but
nothing major though nothing
apart from something just jumped out that was a bit of a pain
what do you reckon it's in pretty good nick as a judge
before tony and jon have a chance to deliver their verdict to the school they're recalled to kew tony's responsible for fourteen thousand trees in the royal botanic gardens and there's a problem that means some of his own trees need saving kew has got an invasion of continental oak processionary moths the caterpillars attack our native oaks and need to be removed now before they become moths and fly away to reproduce threatening yet more trees it's not just the trees that need protecting
so a bit different to what we normally wear complete coverage masks respirators totally different to what we normally do not chainsaws blow torch
the caterpillar of this parasite has sixty two thousand fine hairs each one carrying bacteria which can cause severe rashes and breathing problems
if this insect gets hold in england it'll change people's lives for sure it's that serious very serious if you have say fifty or one hundred nests in this tree then overnight they could defoliate the whole tree that'll put the tree under stress we're catching it in its early stages now being proactive and stopping it getting to those proportions
with each nest containing up to two hundred caterpillars to eradicate the threat to the tree and to people below you need to get rid of the nests which means someone needs to get into the tree
so do i look like a spaceman
tony has personal experience of how bad these caterpillars can be
what they do when you aggravate the caterpillars they can shoot those hairs out sixty two thousand of them and you come up with a rash it looked like i had chicken pox so i got caught out without clothing on when we didn't really understand much about them so i don't want to get caught again
jon has to remove each nest by hand and eliminate any stray hairs that are left behind with a blowtorch
you start itching just just thinking about it
plenty of hairs in there yeah another one for the incinerator
well done jon tree pests and diseases are a problem they are with us and we will get more with climate change and if you think you have a problem with a tree then call in an approved arborist or your local authority arboricultural officer it's pretty hot in the mediterranean where he comes from originally but it's very hot where he's going now job done
the recent invasion of parasites from the continent has been made possible by changing climate warmer summers have also caused droughts resulting in the loss of many native trees to ensure future generations have trees at all tony's been pioneering a radical approach for anyone planning to get planting this is his own approach to saving trees in the long term if british summers are to become more like mediterranean then tony believes we should start planting trees more suited to that climate
it's a big day today the mayor of london ken livingstone is coming to officially open this garden the landscape we've created here is potentially a garden of the future this if climate change continues then this is a type of garden that we're likely to see certainly in the south east of england we've got lots of trees here we've got pines and oaks and olives you may remember in the last series we went to italy we chose these olives and then we craned them in and the morris dancers wassailed them with olive oil so we broke a bit of tradition there but there they are flowering away ready to produce olives these are trees that weren't commonly planted five years ago but now these are trees that we'll see more of in the south east of england if the climate changes as it's doing today the team have been through here today and got it looking good and it is looking good but you always find the odd weed it's fine now he's coming now so better be on our stations
a mediterranean garden we have a small ceremony for you right right right one two three open
cameras click
there we go
may i introduce tony kirkham
hi nice to meet you
the theme this year is the mediterranean so we're looking at showing plants people can plant in gardens not water that will survive our climate now in the south do you like working with trees
i love anything in the garden it's the only thing that keeps me sane i got it from my mum she'd be out in the garden at midnight with a torch
well you know we will change the tree scape by planting trees and selection is important well that was it that all seemed to go well he's very interested but job done here i've got to get on now because i've got to get on with this mission and go and look at some trees i've got to get me kew kit back on and away so
tony and jon are heading to the east of england showground in peterborough this large exhibition centre is nearing completion and five horse chestnuts are in the way of an outside display area everyone's been thinking hard about how to save them and tony's returned to see if they've come up with a solution
we think we've got one and here it is now it's coming now that is big kit jon big kit jon thought we were bringing a spade and a wheelbarrow
perhaps the most dramatic way to save a tree is simply to pick it up and move it this tree weighs around five tonnes and needs to be moved five hundred fifty metres to the other side of the showground they've had to call in one of the biggest of these machines in britain to do the job
what's happening this is a machine that goes round the tree this'll close up and there's several stakes that push into the ground and go under and join underneath under the root ball and it can all be lifted out
don't think i'm even gonna get me hands dirty today
there's some power there as those blades start to cut in jeff what's the idea of the water
it just hits the back of the spade and makes it easier it just lubricates the soil and makes it a lot easier for us to dig
so are you just start with this one straightaway from ya
whilst some of the roots are inevitably cut off enough of the root ball is retained to give the tree a good chance of surviving the move
yeah i've got the power now it's in my hands
it's all about watering you know it's all right him pulling levers
ready to lift jim
tony d'you wanna jump in yep
we're right off the ground now the whole lorry's up is it just on the back wheels don't look back into the sun by the libertines what a piece of kit that is let's see if it'll go in the hole now so there's a watering loop in here so this is a tube that's perforated and the idea is that you can get water in there by pouring it down the tube look at that straight in i tell you what when these people look out their window in the morning they'll get a surprise how do you make sure it's dead upright
look at the tree through here keep your eye looking at the top making sure it stays nice and level
pretty good that and there it is job done tree moved new home there's no reason why that won't survive another one hundred years yep trees today are under threat like never before but what we've seen in this programme are the extraordinary lengths that people go to to save trees well that's another tree saved for the future jon job done
tony and jon have one more important job to do before heading back to kew they've returned to thomas willingale school in loughton to give some news to an expectant audience
i'm absolutely delighted we are as well
plant a little seed plant a little seed plant it in the ground plant it in the ground wait for it to grow wait for it to grow don't don't dis don't dis turb don't dis turb it
next time tony and jon take to the air to look at the plight of trees in cities jon goes up in the world and tony gets a helping hand
vienna birthplace of the waltz mozart beethoven schubert and strauss all lived here it's still a city rich in musical tradition it's also the home to eurovision young musicians two thousand eight eurovision young musicians brings together some of europe's most promising musical talent the event has become an integral part of austria's music calendar held every two years the competition opens the vienna music festival sixteen competitors all under the age of nineteen arrived in vienna on a mission to be one of the seven finalists staged here in the heart of vienna the city hall square the concert is broadcast all over europe representing the u. k. is chromatic harmonica player philip achille
if i get through from the semifinal this is where i'll be performing in front of this giant stage and fifty thousand people
as well as international recognition philip could walk away with a winning prize of five thousand euros and the coveted title eurovision young musician two thousand eight during its twenty six year history only one briton has won the competition nineteen ninety four was natalie clein's year already b. b. c. young musician of the year she went to on to claim the eurovision young musicians title an achievement that firmly established natalie on the classical circuit
it was a big deal my world opened up definitely that year ninety four no question about it so that was great and i got known a little bit more outside of britain and again invited to some festivals and met a few colleagues so i'd say it was an extension of what happened in britain
so could philip repeat natalie's triumph in this competition currently studying harmonica and saxophone at the royal college of music there's a lot at stake
i'm on the first year of my four year course at the royal college of music so i'm doing a bachelor of music course i'm having a great time at the moment just being able to be surrounded by like minded people and being immersed in this environment and all this music
apart from the harmonica philip's other love is the bass guitar
i have a band going called the frontiers and we try to play whenever we can wherever we can and erm i love funk whenever i play something it doesn't matter what style it is every style has a groove i just like to groove there isn't really a kind of style that i don't like i just try to get as much of everything that i can
it's been a busy few years for philip playing the chromatic harmonica he received the tabor foundation award at the b. b. c. young musician competition back in two thousand six
i was the first harmonica they'd actually had in the competition even though it had been listed for so many years so that was great as well and just being able to bring it to the people to people that hadn't heard it before it was good to do something new it was special enough to get to the quarterfinals but to get the prize was just like it's supposed to be an acknowledgment of achievement so i was just really humble and grateful that they'd considered me worth the money they gave me so yeah it was really good
ever since his life has been a series of highs including playing at the world's biggest music festival the b. b. c. proms
so to vienna where philip hopes the judges will be as enthused with the harmonica as he is but with the semifinals of eurovision young musicians underway he still has a big decision to make which of his trusted harmonicas will he choose
i haven't actually decided yet i take two on just in case you see i'm just warming them up now to see what mood they're in that'll basically dictate
with minutes to go the tension is building backstage trying to keep cool under the pressure philip's thoughts turn to the performance ahead
i try not to get too bogged down in this whole idea of perfection i just go out there and give people a bit of me cos that's the part that i give people they wouldn't have seen before the accuracy and stuff is all good and you practise your piece and go over it many times but all this is nothing at the end of the day you go out there and perform and enjoy yourself that's what i'm gonna do
philip has done all he can it's in the hands of the judges now with the semifinals held over two days there's an agonising wait ahead what better way to relax than take in the sights of vienna with his mum many of the great composers lived and worked in vienna chopin haydn mozart beethoven their legacy is still present in various forms in the city today finally the waiting's over it's time for philip to find out his fate has he done enough to make the final of the competition
third one nineteen years old plays the chromatic harmonica
so philip becomes one of the seven contestants who'll represent their countries in the final
getting here was good getting to the final is crazy so now it's like i was a winner before but now it's like yeah this is win as they say this is win
four days later and a crowd approaching fifty thousand is gathering in vienna's city hall square eagerly awaiting the finalists under the baton of aleksandar markovic each of the seven will perform a piece of their choice with the vienna symphony orchestra if that's not pressure enough there's also the matter of the jury pianist ranko markovic is the artistic director at the conservatory vienna university world renowned pianist jeanette de boer from the netherlands violinist lars anders tomter a professor at the state academy in oslo from the vienna philharmonic orchestra flautist gunter voglmayr trumpeter alison balsom a previous finalist in the b. b. c. young musician competition and chair of the jury celebrated english conductor opening the competition is sixteen year old jan gricar from slovenia currently studying at the conservatorium of music in ljubljana his chosen piece is pequena czarda by pedro iturralde jan gricar coping with the pressure of being the first competitor at only thirteen years old cellist anastasia kobekina from russia is the youngest competitor a student at the moscow state conservatory tonight she performs the first movement from haydn's cello concerto in c. major despite getting a little close to the microphone at the end a remarkably mature performance from anastasia kobekina now the moment we've been waiting for it's philip's turn to perform with the vienna symphony orchestra he's chosen the second movement from spivakovsky's concerto for harmonica philip does himself and britain proud winning over the viennese audience to the sound of the harmonica the fourth contestant is roope grondahl from finland who is currently studying the piano at the sibelius academy roope is going to perform the third movement from tschaikowsky's piano concerto in b. minor roope grondahl from finland clearly enjoying performing there with the vienna symphony orchestra next on stage dionysios grammenos from greece a student at the athens conservatory his chosen piece is the fourth movement from jean francaix's concerto for clarinet and orchestra a polished performance from dionysius grammenos clearly enjoyed by the vienna crowd steven bourne from the netherlands is the second cellist in the final studying at the conservatory of amsterdam he'll perform elegie by faure faure's elegie performed by the netherlands' steven bourne our final contestant comes from norway violinist eldbjorg hemsing has already won the norwegian soloist prize this year for this competition she plays the carmen fantasie by franz waxman eldbjorg hemsing rounding up a wonderful evening of music with the ever popular waxman's carmen fantasie with all the seven finalists returning to the stage it's time for chairman of the jury sir roger norrington to announce the results
well the jury have decided that the third place should go indeed to eldbjorg hemsing of norway for the second prize the jury have decided on roope grondahl of finland and the first prize and the winner is dionysius grammenos of greece

do you know what i miss most it's just little things the smile on jim's face when i've given him his liver and bacon because that's his favourite folding his pyjamas wet towels on the bed dirty socks under it
i mean what is there to miss
ooh what's happened
take your time love we're here
i was fourteen frightened lost
but your mum glynda she never said anything
no well she and my dad they were splitting up so there were loads of doors banging bags being packed i just wanted to keep it to myself
for how long five months
i wasn't really showing or at least i didn't think i was then one day we were in the middle of a conversation and she she just stopped right in the middle of a sentence the blood drained from her face well the roof really came off then cos a pregnant teenager was the last thing they needed
why didn't anyone call
the next couple of months i don't remember much my dad just silent angry there was a car journey a damp room i couldn't see much there was a skylight and i could hear seagulls and then there was this this beautiful baby beautiful little baby girl and he took her
who did dad
my dad the one person in my life who is supposed to protect me and he took my baby oh darling but where
where did he take her oh oh come here my darling come here my sweetheart
oh a reputation that's what you want
i'm british mum it's what we do
yeah i've seen them half naked falling over drunk
i'm perfectly capable of looking after myself don't you want to get married what to a muslim boy i don't know i see i mean if i like h. im
at least people round here actually like me you've got no idea what people actually say about you
what do they say is it any wonder
shouting with some five year old about sitting on a wall shouting at mickey why have you got to be so angry all the time no come on don't hold back
you've obviously been hanging around listening to idle gossip what do they say
that you're a mean bitter twisted old witch
so that's what you think of me
no i didn't say me
that i'm a failure as a mother as a wife you don't listen it's what imzamam thinks it's what he's been telling me for years
he's the only one you don't shout at
your uncle has been very good to us
and that gives him the right to order you about uncle imzamam says jump and you say how high talk about shame that makes me ashamed of you
you think you're so clever you've got no idea
if you think i'd marry a man who orders me around thinks he owns me
you will do as you're told no i won't because i live in england
if you wanted me to behave like we were in pakistan we should've moved there she could've died if you hadn't been giving me a migraine earlier
i wouldn't have switched it off i'm kidding myself me and minty was never gonna work
hey what you talking about
who's minty
her husband she's just come back from honeymoon oh my commiserations
getting married was the happiest day of my life now i've ruined it
of course you ain't don't you think minty ain't gonna come home steaming one night
my wedding day like a fairy tale dress horse and carriage till i caught prince charming in bed with my ugly sister
that's what i wanted a fairy tale guess that's what i got cos it ain't real
of course it's real you got a ring on your finger ain't you what more do you want
look darling why don't you go and wash your face do your make up don't worry secrets are no good between families they all worm their way out in the end to think she kept that bottled up all those years not that i'm much the wiser the way ronnie tells it archie practically ripped that baby out of her arms
all i know is she got in the car pregnant he took her off to some relatives when she got back it was all over
what did he have her adopted
honestly auntie peg i don't know ronnie's always blamed dad but he was just as cut up about it as the rest of us
archie adores you girls he'd never do anything to hurt either one of you
please don't ask her any more about it auntie peg
all right all right so come on let's talk about you
when syed left your father couldn't cope he was just a book keeper syed was the accountant he tried to keep things going but losing his son the business just didn't matter any more and the truth is we were just in a mess
uncle imzamam
he found someone to take over the accounts helped us sell up move here without him i don't know what we would have done
that's what families do it shouldn't give him some kind of hold over you you didn't do anything wrong i thought you and minty were getting on well we are but we're more like best friends hev have you made a move oh what do you want cue cards
you can't create a spark you either got it or you ain't maybe it's time i faced up to it me and minty ain't no relationship is perfect hev you know that but yours is i was sixteen living in pakistan and i had a friend who was married to a local boy
what was she called amina
she was happy at first her family were very kind to her she spent most of her time in the kitchen cooking and then one day a young man came to the village visiting relatives and they fell in love
bet that didn't go down well
there was so much work to be done in the house that she found it difficult to see him but she found a way there were excuses secret meetings it was all very exciting they were always careful but someone must have seen them
they got found out
a rumour started that was enough and then the family stopped her going out she was like a prisoner you see everyone said that she had shamed the family and then one day in the kitchen there was a different smell not spices something stronger kerosene and heat on my skin biting i ran to the kitchen door but it was locked and then i started screaming shouting for someone anyone come quickly the kitchen's on fire and i started pushing and pushing but i couldn't open the door so i ran to the window and that's when i saw her her face staring back at me through the flames
did she get out
she was burned they took her to the hospital but afterwards no one spoke about it
why it was just an accident
it wasn't an accident it wasn't an accident spare batteries for your torch spare fuses battery operated radio that's it that is tanya's emergency supply kit but i keep a bottle of vodka in mine
oh i say i am impressed mind you i never touch alcohol
no floods and tsunamis terrorist attacks you've got to be prepared ain't ya
well since we was married i've always left all that to jim
don't get me wrong i'm no women's libber i've never had an urge to put up a shelf in my life more than happy to leave all that to max
yes well it's when things go wrong that i miss him most
yeah sundays are worst for me still it's not as if we're on our own is it eh you've got bradley and clare and i've got the kids and jack jack's been great has he just you know with the kids and that giving us a lift with shopping
yeah well jim always said that of the two jack was the gentleman it's a wonder he ain't been snapped up i mean he's polite good looking everything a girl could want
doctor will be here soon i feel o. k. now
look you clearly need the rooms so why can't you just sling us out
not till i've shifted that lot still wanna make your phone call
suppose so what's his name again mr. wonderful phil
her boyfriend's called vinnie
when i asked earlier you said he was called phil
what's the point in phoning vinnie what's he gonna do send in a saint bernard
well when you've decided let me know
the fire had been started on purpose i was sure of it
by who
someone in the family the girl had brought shame on them
because she fell in love
there were rules expectations she broke them
but she didn't deserve that mum you don't believe you can't i'm not saying that i agree with it
you can't go against everything everyone stand alone
sometimes you have to why can't you accept for once that your mother knows best so they punished her and what did it achieve did she love the boy any less well did she
you know what go ahead do your own thing go your own way but don't come crying to me when you left out in the cold
mum i'm twenty two years old
and you think you can take on the whole world all on your own but you can't your family your culture you will need them one day you'll see
maybe i won't let you turn your back on them i won't but i need to find my own way too why can't you let me do that
because i don't want to see you getting hurt
vinnie's a decent enough bloke but you don't love him do you you love phil
thought you and vinnie were perfect
nothing's perfect hev you should know that what
that everything's crap and miserable pig's trotters that's what they used to call me other girls they'd push me in the showers in my gym kit cos i didn't want to get changed in front of them they stole my knickers once and hung it from the basketball net they said they were big enough to be the school flag so don't you tell me the world's an ugly horrible place cos i already know that
even if i wanted it me and phil it wouldn't work
you don't know that yeah i do how
he turned me down didn't he it was stupid of me to have even asked the question i've seen the type of girls he looks at in the bar they don't look like me
what if phil turned up now and said he'd changed his mind he wanted to give it another go what would you do
tell him to shove it
oh aggressive moody difficult yeah well you two have got things in common
when i hear stories like this how can you expect me to feel proud of my culture
it was a terrible thing shabnam but are you trying to tell me that terrible things don't happen in england
it's just i dunno who i am sometimes a bit of this a bit of that where i belong
pakistan is such a beautiful country shabnam i would love to take you there one day not what you see on the news but what it's really like one day i will
think it'll help me figure out who i am
see
he sounded worried that's kind of love innit
when them bullies had a go at you what did you do
skipped school hid in the boiler room it's about time you stood up and was counted
be brave bold give it to him on a plate men have needs
yeah brave bold right what about you
what phil nah he makes me confused i don't like being confused i'm too old i know where i am with vinnie
maybe you know you should try to be a bit nicer to him minty vinnie we could do a lot worse
i suppose

yeah well you do act like one sometimes don't you
i've spoken to auntie peggy and you're right i've got no man no money no common sense
speaking to auntie peg has made everything clear all right i know what i've gotta do
and i'm going to be there every step of the way when you have this baby
what sod waiting
six young athletes have accepted the challenge of a lifetime to travel the world and compete against the most remote tribes on earth on their own turf
i am really bricking it oh
i have no idea where we're going
all six men are masters in their chosen fields covering the heavy lifting brad brings the brawn
hey i'm a strong man every competition you are your one man army
oxford graduate richard is english grit
i love to win i hate losing
jason's a champion b. m. x. sprinter who's fought his way to the top
mark is all technique a salsa dancer with a punch
i'm pretty good at everything that i do
corey's a harvard educated scientist
i'll use my brain before i'll use my muscle
and a top endurance athlete
conquered
and rajko's a fitness guru with a body honed to perfection
i want to achieve my optimum as a physical being
i've never ever seen anything like this i'm just speechless
they're on the third leg of a contest that's taking them all over the world in brazil they fought kalapalo warriors in a festival of death brad's strength brought him out on top that's right i'm brad and against zulu fighters it was mark's skill in martial arts that clinched him the top prize but their challenge in mexico is going to be very different it's a high altitude running race in the mountains that will test our athlete's bodies to destruction
it hurts
and leave their confidence in shreds
i just can't do it
it's like running on burning coals
i hate losing
their goal to compete against the tarahumara some of the best natural endurance runners in the world our athletes have been invited to stay in a tarahumara village that has a long tradition of racing
this is it man
i'm jason rajko brad
mark corey ricardo vicente he's the chief ahh thank you very much
la mesa de la hierbabuena is an isolated community of only thirty homes but despite that it manages to field two rival running teams representing either end of the village mark corey and jason will be living and competing for the lower village
i don't know what this is
me you you outside they just met me and um from what i understand they've never seen anybody like me they're just gonna give me the house you know what i mean
with just eight days until they're due to race our athletes have got to pick up the pace and it's running coach mariano's job to knock them into shape
first we'll learn to kick the ball and after we learn to kick it we'll learn to run and then we'll learn to run and kick the ball
yeah
this isn't what our athletes were expecting they'll be training for the gruelling carerra de bola it's a long standing tradition in which two teams race over a rocky mountain course kicking a small wooden ball all the way
that was horrible
no matter how hard i focus i just can't get it off the ground
it's hard it's a little bit painful actually and running and doing it would be a nightmare we're all struggling so that's good except rich he thinks he's good there oh rich
oxford theologian richard is a college all rounder he's solid at the crease quick on the rugby field and not at all bad with a croquet mallet
i give my best shot that's what i've been taught maybe that's the english way
but tribes play by their own rules and so far richard has been pummelled first against kalapalo warriors in brazil then against zulu stick fighters
damn right it's scary
but although college boy richard might not like fighting an endurance race could be his chance to shine
obviously this is a new sport this is you know this is something i have no experience of but my strengths lend themselves quite well to it
our athletes' ball skills are so bad that mariano asks local children to show them how it should be done
uno dos tres
unfortunately the real competition will be far more than child's play right now our athletes have no idea just how long the race is going to be in fact the carerra de bola can last a whole agonising day and sometimes more
why am i the only one breathing hard
brad's one of america's top strong men
i see myself as an average sized kid everybody else was just small
and so far he's used brute power to good effect winning in brazil
that's right i'm brad
and impressing zulus in africa
my game plan the whole time has been intimidation i'm not losing
brad competes to be a superhero for his one year old amethyst
since my little one has been born i've definitely become a different person
but his strength isn't going to help him run in mexico
none of my training involves any type of endurance this is gonna be me stepping into my personal hell
brad has no chance he won't mind me saying that and jason doesn't either
endurance has never been my thing
mark's a bit of an unknown quantity because he always makes out like he's not competitive or that you know he's not that good but in actual fact he probably is very good
i think this event is really gonna play to my strengths
but i still think that the top three is gonna be me then corey then richard
the athletes will race for their village teams alongside the locals and mariano wants to see if they stand any chance of coping so far only one of them has caught his eye harvard scientist corey is no strength athlete and he's certainly not a fighter
damn it i think i've consistently shown that i'm pretty big pansy when it comes to contact sports
but this bug specialist is completely at home outdoors in the natural world
i was born in alaska and as a result the mountains and nature are my home that's what i connect to that has made me everything i am today
endurance is corey's speciality if any event is tailored to his skills it's running at altitude with the tarahumara
it's my event it's endurance that's what i train for in the mountains and here we are in the mountains ready to run
today's training is over and it's left our athletes with a lot to think about
we were all thinking that it's just gonna be a straightforward long distance run across the mountains and it's turned out that that's not the case ahh this is gonna be a bitch that's damn near as far as i've ever run
it's gonna be tricky kicking that ball and running and i just can't imagine how we could do it on anything that's not flat ground or go up a hill with that ball so a bit confusing at the moment
if rajko thought that was confusing wait until he finds out about another aspect of tarahumara running that's going to make the race even tougher for all of them the locals wear homemade sandals cut from old car tyres and guess what our athletes are gonna have to wear them too
they weave the laces in and out of the sole a couple of times to make a heel on it which you put your foot on then you have this really long strap that comes around and you just wrap it around your leg over and over and over again ah perfecto
on the plus side the sandals are ideal for flicking the wooden ball on the minus side they're going to hurt quite a lot
i can't really see running a great distance in these things man i'm hoping that the leather gives a bit more than what it does otherwise it's gonna be a very painful run we'll see how it goes
we're gonna be running up hills through crevices on rocks and in sandals
kicking the ball in the heat in altitude nuts what the hell are we doing
the most talented young runner in the village is fifteen year old lirio he's captain of the upper village team lirio is keen to get straight into training with the ball and the sandals
yeah so far i mean it's only the first two hundred metres or so and already it's starting to take its toll but the ball is eh the ball's looking promising we're going at quite a good pace
it's only a short run but within minutes brad begins to struggle
it's o. k. at this pace as long as they don't speed up it's hard kicking it though the route isn't too bad though is it it's pathways now if it was across grass it would be impossible
unfortunately rajko has only seen a small part of the course
i tell you i don't know how we're gonna bloody run on this let alone kick the ball joke especially in sandals
as captain of the lower village mariano is giving corey mark and jason a tour of the track and as they reach the most difficult section of the course it's time for some health and safety
wow holy shit
what is it a spider yeah i know it's a spider
watch out for the poisonous spiders too
it was further up there it did sound pretty close
oh yes and don't forget the rattlesnakes
this whole course has got like spines and spikes and cactuses and rocks to break your ankle on and poisonous spiders i mean this actually is a course i'm kinda concerned about
especially the ones on the floor you're not gonna know when you're running where they are you'll not know where the snake is
we went out running in our sandals for the first time and it was an absolute swine it was like running in flip flops through mud over rocks cause that's pretty much what they are but saying that it could have been worse my feet are a bit blistered but it wasn't wasn't horrific it was just bad
we're gonna be running in some of the most grisly sandals you've ever seen over rocks and mountains which are steeper than any hill i'd normally run over it's a daunting it's more than a daunting prospect it's terrifying
our athletes were never expecting it to be easy but the snakes the sandals and that little ball will make this an event that will push them to their limits and some of them beyond all the athletes are staying with families in the village and they have to work to repay them for their hospitality
i'm just helping my host ramon collect the corn from the fields there's a greeting here called quera quera is a hello but at the same time it's sort of it's the basis of their society quera means let's help each other let's work for each other you know let's live together so i'm saying to ramon thank you for giving me the hospitality thank you for feeding me let me help you in the field and earn my way
some of the newly cut maize is made into a beer called tesguino and inspired by the lashings of homebrew rajko has a surprise party planned
party let's get ready to rumba
there you go oh my god
first legal sip right here woo woo yeah ramon
nobody seems to sip a beer quietly here it seems to be down in one yeah keep it going keep it going you got it to the bottom to the bottom yey
if i had to rate it on a one to ten scale of the drinks i'd pick it'd definitely be a two but this will work for my birthday
we you know we grew up real rough and you know fighting is fun to me i like to fight
but jason's fighting failed him in brazil and he was nervous about taking on the zulus
i'm just starting to think that you know i might not do it
before his raw aggression broke through taking him to second place
i did good man i was happy with how i performed that day
but the boy fighter is growing up planning to settle down with his childhood sweetheart
just want to be happy man
for jason this whole journey is one of self discovery
i'm glad we were able to celebrate jason's birthday it meant a lot to him and it meant a lot to all of us and he said he'll never forget it so that's great
happy birthday to you
there are just four days to the race and a tropical storm is blowing through the canyon mariano has halted training in the upper village there is no such caution lirio has decided to run his team ragged and now he's just showing off running out ahead of his team over the mile long course lirio leaves them for dead
i won't deny it was pure evil i tried to stay up with them but i couldn't two things particularly upset me about that run one is that he is totally not out of breath and nor is richard that upsets me greatly
yeah it was getting pretty tough there and i think if that's their sort of cruising pace i don't know how we're gonna cope i'm hoping he was really sort of showing what he can do and really stretching his legs but then he looks completely unfazed
he's so light and quick it's quite hard phew
all the competitors are powerful athletes but rajko is something else
the dumbbells are twenty kilos
his strength won him a world record
the record i set was five hundred fifty consecutive lifts
and rajko is also the ultimate all rounder
obviously i'll have good endurance and that will be upper body and lower body because of my training
he's already come close to winning in the first two contests
i really felt i was gonna win that one i came that close to winning
and now he's hoping that his mental strength will at last bring him out on top the tropical storm passes through and our athletes carry on acclimatizing to high altitude but they still haven't been told just how long the race is going to be they know it's a mile long course around the village but no one's said how many laps they'll be doing and the days of training have taken their toll on one of the favourites
an injury i thought i recovered from a long time ago has now come back the problem with shin splints is that the only way to recover from it is just to do nothing pretty much nothing athletic other than like pool workouts and stuff so the fact that it's showing signs that it may be re aggravated is pretty serious
i want you to give it a go and see how you get on corey
it's just two days to the race and corey could be out and rajko has problems too
ah a bit of cobbling going on
yeah the sandals just slip around a lot and so this is my first phase of two my homemade solution for solving this blister problem
or infecting it infecting it possibly
watch this phase two superglue
why are you supergluing your foot what's going on here
it's to toughen it up a little bit
that's genuinely not superglue is it oh shucks it's actually superglue
yeah my fingers are gonna stick to it in a second isn't that toxic probably hang on it should make the skin tougher wherever i put it on it stings actually
ha ha it stings i can see it in your face this is completely ridiculous
it should work though
what does it say on the back of the superglue thing does it has one of those like skull and crossbones that says it's toxic
can cause severe eye injury instantly bonds skin that's all i need to know
that's not a good thing though i mean it says like watch out it instantly bonds skin in a bad way
in case of skin bonding quickly flush water and avoid quick quick quick
while rajko lets his glue dry it's the lower village's final practice session and corey is still working hard to make the race on sunday
i'm feeling that my team's real strong we took a test run around the course and we did really great i couldn't imagine it going much better than that
everybody knew what they had to do the communication was there and that's what being a good team is about well done that was nice
but the mood is rather different in the upper village richard suddenly started throwing up instead of training he's gone to bed missing out on lirio's special booze fuelled final session
are you serious woo he's a skilled drinker he is
right let's go and train
and richard's illness isn't the only problem facing the upper village team
sandals are utter shit i hate these things really painful they keep slipping off i can't kick the ball argh bollocks
rajko might claim supreme mental strength but clearly it doesn't extend to his feet
i truly despise these sandals
do you think it'd be easier barefoot i would sooner can i go barefoot are you gonna try to pull that off i just can't take the pain it's a nightmare something wrong with your foot is it not getting your foot here yeah it sucks but i keep thinking is i would rather feel the pain between my toes than to be barefoot
no i just can't do it nah it's so uncomfortable that it's really irritating me now i was thinking i'll be all right i'll push through but i can't do it
rajko rajko
i've been working harder than anyone else since we've been here but it's coming down to one simple fact is i can't run in these sandals it's just too painful and i i dunno i don't think i could do it why does it have to come down to who can wear some shitty little sandals i never wear those stupid sandals that have the thing that goes in between your first two toes whatever you call them thongs because i've always hated them and now i have to not only wear them but run in them
suddenly it's all gone topsy turvy as the three favourites hit trouble corey's injured rajko is in sandal hell and richard's day is going from bad to worse
this is probably the worst preparation i could possibly have i feel really sick and i've got a pretty chronic case of the runs and to make matters worse these guys are just singing louder and louder it's about three in the morning i feel really sick i've been to the loo about five times already tonight and these guys just keep on drinking it's now about five thirty in the morning and as you can hear they've just started singing could be one of the worst nights of my life
the race is tomorrow and the ceremonies are already beginning a cow is sacrificed to provide meat for the runners the first blood is offered up to the gods for the tarahumara the race even the ball is sacred after a tough week brad and jason are resting before the challenge of the race and with rajko corey and richard all in trouble birmingham provides an unexpected favourite
things have really gone my way this week in a way that they've never normally gone before like rajko would normally be in the favourites and for some reason he's had problems with his sandals richard fell ill two days ago corey's got problems with his shins so the guys who were in the top three who would run away with it they've got problems so i don't think i will win it but i think it's sort of raised my chances which is maybe why i've gone from being a nobody into being someone that can probably win it
mark's dancing skills won't help much in mexico but his kick boxing training does make him a contender
kick boxing makes you stronger makes you faster makes you react quicker
his strength wasn't enough in brazil but his speed was on show in africa
stick fighting proved to me that if i
his martial arts skills took him to a win
that was one of the proudest moments of my life
now in mexico he's out for two in a row but the favourites are not about to give up the superglue didn't work but rajko has another daft plan
i've completely eradicated the thong and i have taped my foot directly to the sandal that's quite comfortable yeah back in the game
meanwhile corey desperate to deal with his injury has turned to the shaman
he said it's only found up high because of the cooler climate it's not found down here so we've got to hike a ways up but then it's unclear how far we have to go
they're looking for the mescal cactus a powerful anaesthetic
considering my leg's in a lot of pain anything to help it will be much obliged
even richard seems to be on the mend
rich how are you feeling my friend
feeling feeling it's totally better i need to eat some food i think seeing as i haven't had anything for about twenty four hours
it turns out he's in luck on the eve of the race all the runners are brought together to eat the meat of the sacrificed cow
it tastes really good just enough salt not much fat on the meat it doesn't get fresher than this really good
but there's a big moment coming tradition dictates that it's now that the length of the race is announced a job that falls to vicente the chief
i think he said we're going around the course twenty seven times
twenty seven times do you want to double check it depends how long the course is
twenty seven miles in sandals uh we know how long the course is how long at least a mile it's almost exactly marathon length then running a marathon in the mountains
if you put on a pair of trainers could you run the london marathon
absolutely not we're in sandals
we're five thousand five hundred feet in the air
take away my shoes take away the flat ground take away take away the lines of supporters
so it's literally the last man standing isn't it i don't think we're gonna finish it
it is yeah it's last man standing it's whoever's still going
no way no that's crazy
bloody hell i'm feeling nervous now i think we're all feeling really quite nervous it's kind of nervous and excited but it's excited in a bit of a sadistic way because i know it's gonna be crazy
it's a long rough course it's gonna be hard people are gonna be you know people are gonna be hurt people are gonna cry people are gonna i don't even know what to say man it's hard core
today's gonna be completely different to anything that any of us have ever been through before this is so far beyond being just a long distance this is fifty one kilometres it's uphill over rocks and jagged terrain and it's in sandals which are only barely better than running across hot coals in bare feet it's gonna be seriously painful today
i'm looking forward to the racing but i'm anxious i was up all night my adrenaline's been pumping for about six hours now
i'm not looking forward to running at all the only thing i do look forward to is to find out what i have in myself and today is definitely gonna be my greatest obstacle to overcome
all last night i was just telling myself you can't win this don't try to win this you're not gonna win this if i think that i have a chance i might go for it and be stupid and hurt myself so it's a really tough thing for me to deal with but i just have to understand that today this is not my race
if there's one event that really shows athleticism will and determination it's this one and if i can win this one i've proved a lot to myself
lots of thoughts running through my head how my knee's gonna cope how are my feet gonna cope i believe i have the fitness and i believe i have the mental strength i just don't know whether my body can cope with something that's that different and that far
with the race about to start the shaman delivers his blessing to the runners and the ball on paper it's a team race brad rajko and richard with the upper village mark corey and jason with the lower village but in reality all six are competing against each other to be the last man standing
our team was incredibly fast they were shooting off with the ball so the best we could do was just keep them in eyesight and so rich and i did that we stayed with them and brad i think just had to run his own race
i already can't breathe it's only the first lap right after that first lap reality set in my body was saying i really don't want to do this then my mind took over and said we'll make this happen let's do it no matter how much you're hurting do it
our team's doing good we're keeping a nice solid pace we're on a pace to finish i think the others are on an individual pace to win we're on a team pace to finish the whole race
me corey and jason kept to our tactics of just taking it easy playing tortoise and the hare we knew rajko and richard would just head off which just played we knew exactly what was happening
i seen richard and rajko blasting off at maximum pace if you're trying to run a marathon through the mountains and i figured hey you know they're just gonna keep running this pace and eventually their body's not gonna allow them to go any further
sure enough just three laps in and rajko is suffering
by the third lap i was thinking if this gets progressively harder as it seems to be i'm not even gonna last a quarter of it it's getting harder every lap i'm just trying to keep my temperature down
he was breathing very heavily and i think he was finding it quite tough so at that point the race was really mine to win
richard pulls out a lead leaving rajko behind half a mile back corey and his team are pacing themselves
real careful on this part guys don't waste energy running
but the race is about to claim its first victim
take a drink mark go for it just go for it
mark's still in it's corey who's out the pain in his shins has become unbearable
once it really started throbbing a lot i had to leave and it was really tough for me to do that but i think it was the right choice for me to leave it's not just skiing it's mountaineering it's hiking it's everything that i love about athletics that i could lose by being stupid here
with corey out strongman brad takes up fifth place
brad was a true inspiration because to see him just you know through vomiting and through the expression on his face was just you know the essence of pain like it was just so incredible to see him go that far
but after five laps further than he's ever run before brad's race is over
i wanted to see how far i could push myself and see what would happen i kept comparing this to going through my own personal hell you know but i lost my battle my daughter amethyst i want her to be proud of me i failed
team wise lirio's upper village side has opened up a massive lead and it's growing by the second as the lower village searches for a lost ball as for our four remaining athletes richard is still leading rajko with a long gap to mark and then finally jason
i'm really out of breath i'm starting to get dizzy trying to stay focused keep my legs going no matter how fast it is so i'm running and eventually i end up catching up to my own team cos they were searching for the ball cos they had lost it in some rocks
with the lower village team at a standstill lirio and the upper village pass by a whole lap ahead
finally we find the ball we start kicking it again and we're off
keep it up man keep solid
richard still the leading athlete presses on
i just tried to get a good pace going my own pace and tried to stay up with the main throng of the local runners
but don't be fooled by that comfortable jog because those sandals are really starting to bite
i have three quite bad blisters on my left foot i'm just trying to take my mind off it blisters started to grow out the bottom of my feet and they got pretty bad very quickly
at one point one heard rich say you know i need some help i didn't know what for but it gave me a clue that he was suffering and in a way that was kind of comforting for me because i was suffering like hell but when you're competing against others you don't want them to know how much you're suffering cos that kind of spurs them on
richard's forced to stop for treatment joining mark who's also suffering
my blisters
ah ahh
by the time richard rejoins the race rajko has pushed well into the lead
feeling good because i'm into a steady pace ahead of the others on the other hand i don't think i'm even a quarter of the way through
as the race goes on rajko's effort to break away eventually takes its toll
i just never trained this long that's the problem now my joints are hurting ridiculous pain with blisters just got to kind of pretend it doesn't hurt but it's difficult it started to get really unpleasant i just started to get one big blister across the whole of the base of my foot and any time you kind of changed direction you'd feel the whole shift and it's not only a sick feeling but it's really painful so i had to really dig in because everything started to fail
jason meanwhile is still pacing himself
i'm looking at my other competitors and they're all really starting to look beat up and worn down and just mentally looking like trash and i'm thinking to myself man you really got a chance to prove these people wrong i've just gotta keep running just keep running till tomorrow man see if i could just never stop
jason's strategy could be paying off because richard is also paying the price for his early pace
a lot of it was a very isolated race i was running completely on my own it was basically a battle against the pain really never been in this much pain in my feet they're just you know they've gone from extreme pain to unusual pain it's horrible actually i've very rarely felt pain that badly i mean right up until i just couldn't run any further cos it was too agonising
after nine laps and three hours of agony richard's grit is no longer enough he loses his battle with the sandals
it was a really bitter experience and i don't think i could have carried on running without pain without sort of having to crawl
you ran a great race man
only three of our athletes are left in the race rajko is nearly two laps in the lead but is almost dead on his feet
i feel the whole base of my foot slipping around like one massive blister i felt like crying on the last lap but i just can't don't want to stop
with richard out mark's running strongly in second place and jason's continuing further back both are closing on rajko
i feel like a champion here i never thought i could make it this far it just proves man be positive and keep going like forrest gump
but when lirio's upper village squad laps the lower village team for a second time our runners discover what a cruel mistress the carerra de bola can be
our team lapped the other team twice so they figured screw it you know we can go to sleep it'll take them forever to catch up with us it's gonna take them so long to catch up with us they might not even finish we won game over
mariano the lower village trainer admits defeat and stops the race mark and jason have been slowly gaining on rajko but now they're not going to be allowed to catch him
who knows the rules around here don't touch me nobody touch me
our team lapped your team twice so as soon as they lapped lirio said what's the point of running any more because there's no way they're gonna be able to catch us so game over so the race official gave it to our team
i'm gonna kill somebody it was like i wanted to rip somebody's head off what can you do when you're taken out and you're still in the race and i was still going like i was told and then all of a sudden i lost no man that sucks
he doesn't know it but as the leading athlete when the race was stopped rajko is declared the winner
my knees my calves the whole of my feet my neck probably because i've been running like a hunchback
he is the last man standing
well done man
is that it way to go man that's it
you're done
yeah
how you doing
that was emotional yeah really and the lap before that i was almost crying as i was running it was so unpleasant
you did it it just goes to show how much mental control he really has just that determination rajko had was phenomenal i mean phenomenal how you feeling
next time on last man standing our athletes go to northern india to kick fight with a tribe of head hunters
the dao that i was using actually chopped a person's head off
it's hurt or be hurt really smashed the back of the heel and now i've got excruciating pain
jason has an aggression problem its a beautiful weapon
for the first time i think one of us can win this contest come on
they were chanting like jason the lazy
finish it they're not chanting that any more
our background is we both studied architecture we trained in architecture but we've had an interest in how you might transform very small scale urban spaces involving local residents cos this really seems to be the only way for spaces to be looked after so providing a sense of ownership
when we found a space that was overgrown with buddleia which was then removed during the winter so when we started we had a concrete surface with moss on it the first thing we did was construct this water tower which has a big water butt on the top we ordered well yeah a lorry load of soil and we ordered the bags and filled them by hand with wheelbarrows
the local residents also got involved with making it too
when we first got the soil it was just ordinary builder's soil topsoil what they've got from buildings and what we done we had to put some compost in it and every night i was coming down and turning it over especially when the rain came it helped and after a fortnight we started putting our seedlings in but knowing nothing about gardening i put them all too close and a lot of me lettuces got ruined they did it was a shame broke my broke my heart when i went out but when i got my first cucumber oh beautiful
the idea of the bags was we were dealing with hard landscape here so we were looking at a simple container that you could multiply to provide a big area of planting the bags can take about half a tonne of soil so each bag provides enough growing space for one household cos of the nature of the bags they're weaved plastic and they allow a lot of drainage through it so it provides a good sort of base for doing planting
it's great because we live in flats we don't have any sort of places where we can grow we're not even allowed window boxes which we did enquire about this belongs to me it's my little patch and i can do what i like with it with the permission of my five year old and just somewhere for your herbs i've got some fresh mint which i'm hoping is going to sort of you know spread i want to have half of it mint so that we can make our own tea i feel i'm getting the green finger now
my mum did grow up on an actual farm so i've seen them do a lot of gardening but i don't really have any experience
i've never grown anything in my life never had a garden not even a balcony since i've always lived in central london so it's completely new for me
i think we're gonna keep gardening as long as we can
and yeah i'd love to keep the bags as long as they're gonna do this project if they're doing it next year it'd be great
we hope to in the future set up some sort of organisation with the residents and bag holders here that maybe we have some sort of allotment society or something that really establishes it as something that could stay here for much longer and to expand it maybe and to expand it yeah
because there have been quite a few people interested in having bags but obviously we don't have any more at the moment so since there's a lot of unused spaces in the area they're all vacant so we might as well
i honestly didn't think it would take off at all cos we've got so many drunks here in the park and that and the vandalism but nothing it's just fantastic it is just pleased very pleased it's nice to be proved wrong
we first got involved when we saw wild hybrids growing in kent and we thought that it would be quite interesting to do some of our own hybridisation
it got us wondering if you could get wonderful hybrids like that from the few british species that we've got what could you do if you collected all the foreign ones together that might very well never meet in nature
the most important thing is to ensure that the plant is perennial if it isn't perennial we drop it because the general public wants a plant that's going to survive longer than one year then we're obviously always looking for new and exciting colour breaks because i think the standard hybrid verbascum until now has often been just perhaps slightly dreary we are very interested in breeding more and more of the red terracotta orangey tones because this simply has not been done before
almost all of the wild verbascums are yellow flowered but the idea of having red in a verbascum was intriguing although we produced lots and lots of hybrids they were mainly up until recently pastel colours we tried an awful lot of different parents and then quite by accident one day we spotted one coming into flower that was blood red we've called it firedance and we're propagating large numbers of them here now
it's not on the market yet but we hope that it will be merlin' is one of our favourites and it's got these lovely large pale purple flowers it is also very very tough we leave it out all winter and it survives pretty well
by far the most important pest of verbascums is the mullein moth the moth comes along and lays its eggs in april and the caterpillars hatch in may and you have to catch them when they're very small cos if you let them get big they will defoliate a plant overnight we spend an awful lot of time picking caterpillars off the plants it certainly began as a hobby but it quickly outgrew the back garden and we had to find a piece of land now we've got about as many plants as we can possibly look after at one time
well verbascums have their problems with mullein moths but tulips have their troubles too and you might be wondering why i'm digging out these beautiful tulips well it's because they've got tulip breaking virus these gorgeous sort of yellow striations which are sometimes white too are actually caused by this virus it also affects the leaves sometimes they're very very mottled and eventually it leads to the bulbs becoming very weak and sometimes not flowering at all at one time a flower like this would have been highly prized at the height of tulip mania in holland in amsterdam you could buy a good house for the same price as you might pay for a tulip like this but of course they didn't understand those bulbs were virused what we've got to do now is destroy this whole bulb just get rid of it completely well there won't be any such imperfections at the chelsea flower show that starts next week i know it can be a very fraught time i've exhibited there a few times myself but for rachel de thame it's her very very first exhibition garden and we've been following her progress on the run up to chelsea
i don't know if i could honestly say i'm enjoying it yet i'm feeling the pressure already and i suspect i'm gonna feel like this until the end of the press day and then i'll go phew my background isn't in design i'm interested in plants getting a team together came into it very early on i work with a nursery called clifton nursery i think it's the oldest london nursery they very much help me get the idea from my head into presentable form i wanted it to be a sort of urban haven almost if you like to have a feel of the country in the city but acknowledge the fact that it's in the city and therefore be structural and contemporary and quite reliant on hard landscaping which is something that i thought i wouldn't do at all london it's an urban garden and a lot of the things that i passed and exhibitions i went to and landmarks that i knew existed and interests that i have in film and fashion and art that all came into it as well i saw this incredible image of paddy fields it was all of these tiered planting levels cut into the hillside and i loved the way that they undulated around and rose up so that in a small space you can plant by going up the wall there's an exhibition on currently at the victoria and albert museum called the golden age of couture for me it just seemed right there was something about it about the elegance of the line the colours the black and white and the red and so on partly it was the inspiration for my fair lady hats and it was this picture of audrey hepburn with this wonderful wide brimmed hat that was on an angle and i took that and i used that angle and imagined that it was going into the ground on one side and it's got this great enormous sculpture in it it's going to be an engineering nightmare it's nearly eight months since the beginning of the design process i'm back for my third visit to see how the sculptural structure is progressing it's quite dominant isn't it frankly i'm a little bit nervous with regard to the stringing from my point of view i have from the beginning been asking to get it made in cable
it's like tightening spokes on a wheel tighten two or three then that one goes and you have to go back to that one
what's your thinking with the elastic then
there's something about it in that material that says that it's not a permanent structure it feels to me that it wouldn't last and it would look dirty the minute it's in steel it just has that permanence about it that i'd imagined
anything more pulling on that and you're asking for trouble we can quite happily put eleven cables on there so you can see what it looks like see whether it's a look you like that's no problem the other side of it is that will not take it
it's not what i'd imagined at the outset so i'm having a few problems getting beyond that the next time i actually see this is gonna be at chelsea itself when it arrives on the showground then we have the problem of manoeuvring it into place it's all logistics
there's loads more to come on tonight's programme joe will be continuing with his patio garden here at berryfields reflecting the changing way lots of us have to garden we'll be catching up with rachel de thame as d. day approaches for her chelsea show garden and alys is going to be in the formal garden with our presenters' sweet peas and putting in lots of lovely stuff to compliment them last christmas monty made this rather splendid structure from locally sourced hazel poles it's good and strong and aesthetically pleasing but of course the intention was to use it as a scaffolding for some plants and we're going to use something really intriguing although this wonderful tunnel is part of the edible vegetable garden i think it would be really lovely to grow something there which is completely self indulgent totally ornamental and to that end i'm going to sow some of these beautiful ornamental gourds now you can't eat them but they are absolutely glorious i think it'll be a really decorative way into the vegetable garden from that end they belong to the cucurbit family same family as melons courgettes pumpkins squashes the whole lot and the thing that they have in common is their seeds the seeds are always the same sort of shape some of them are bigger some are smaller but they're always sort of flat and if you turn them on their side they're incredibly thin they all have a pointy end and the trick really is rather than just sow them like that where they might rot is to take the seed find the pointy end stick it into the compost and just push it right into the compost like that so it's just buried by about the same depth of soil now it's mid may and these are going to germinate really rapidly by the time they go out all danger of frost should have gone
so this is the melon bed now last year we had a melon bed it was the first time we tried using the victorian technique and it just didn't work the temperature never really got up it was a bad summer and we had two really poor plants i was all for giving up on melons thinking it was too much effort but monty was like no we've got to have melons so i went back to the drawing board and this is our new melon bed it's different in two ways from the melon bed over there firstly it goes down into the ground we dug out for about half a metre and the idea is that the soil and the thermal heat below will insulate all the donkey poo the other thing that was different is we were really selective about the donkey poo and we only went for really fresh stuff and we religiously turned it for fourteen days and on day fourteen it really heated up and was almost letting off steam and then we dumped it in here and then on the advice of barnsdale we put our own compost on top and then we sat and waited and here's the extraordinary thing and in the evenings it drops down to about eighteen degrees but it's really giving off heat it's been constantly like that for three weeks we've chosen two different melons one of them is sweetheart which is an f. one variety that we used last year and it's especially bred for outdoor use the other one is a four hundred year old variety called petit cris de rennes and it's supposed to be the champagne of melons and it's also a low heat requirement one so they're both suited for outdoor use and i reckon in this space i'm probably only gonna get two melons cos they're quite big rambling plants so i'm gonna go for one here this may be a very old fashioned way to grow melons it's been around since the victorians but at the end the donkey poo will be reused around the garden the frame will become something else and we've got free heat
ooh hello how are you doing
i'm on a scrounge have you got anything for the allotment i thought you might be
so i brought you a couple of pressies from from our house from your place yeah lovely
lovely chard yeah oh listen to him
you identified it immediately well i know what chard looks like for connie and stanley really yeah lovely you can fight about who has which and these are some climbing beans for you go and have a chat with alys
yeah i'm gonna see if alys has got anything i can pilfer and also just have a look around these beautifully arranged beds
funny shape though these they're all rectangular i know strange shape to have
i like those triangles joe and his triangular beds i like them i think they're great completely original just like him well that whole thing of propagating stuff and swapping it is at the heart of proper gardening and back home in devon i've been helping jo russell and fin to start a really sustainable garden but if they're going to change the way they garden first of all they've got to change the garden itself on the coast in north devon joe and russ' garden has undergone some big changes in preparation for the next stage in the garden cycle they bid farewell to the enormous shed and today the raised veg beds are going to take centre stage it is enormous isn't it it really is huge when the shed was there you couldn't really tell no
we knew there was a fair amount of space but until you actually see it visually i've done a few plans this is this area here i'm not sure whether we're gonna have enough room to do this but
it's nice it's very artistic this sort of spiral of life geometry i've put a bit of movement
that's it but it wouldn't grow nearly as much veg as this right
and that's the object to the exercise
it is lots of lovely veg
and what are you gonna make it out of
well the guys that had the shed bless them have given us a load of tongue and groove lengths of plank i guess we thought we could try and put those together have two high raised beds
there's quite a pile of this it works quite simply doesn't it give us a demo so they should be able to fit in there
there we go that's good and i think that sort of width is just about right
this is all available for us to use we can take plenty of this it looks fantastic too
the quality of it look at that yeah brilliant stuff it's beautiful it looks quite sandy it's fantastic and it's very light and sandy just like your own soil which i think is quite important it is really local so very very free draining not going to hold any moisture at all but so easy to cultivate it's fabulous you can tell that despite it being sandy it's quite dark soil and that means it's full of humus which is what you want it's what makes your soil live you know let's go to the minibus with as many bags as we can carry it's back to the garden to create the perfect scenario for jo and russ to grow their own if you don't have access to loads of lovely free top soil you can still edge the beds but dig as deeply as you can instead of raising the surface higher this is probably the last time you'll walk on these beds you'll be able to approach everything from the edges walking on soil really ruins the structure of it but these will just build up their own internal life and you'll probably never have to dig again either
brilliant
a good depth of soil is vital in these beds for productive growing we're using everything we can get our hands on including these turfs which were the ones we lifted when we made jo and russ' nursery bed a few weeks ago the grass has already gone brown and these turfs will soon become good loan when they're in place we can top up with our recycled soil this is the really active part of it from now on in once these are made it's just going to be cultivation how are you feeling about that are you going to be growing stuff i hope so there's nothing like it when all those little seedlings start coming through
monty might be having a break but his sweet peas are really growing there's been some inevitable slug damage and some of them are sulking a little which is quite common for sweet peas in early to middle may they often have a sulky period then just as the days get warmer off they grow so you can give them a bit of a foliage feed but don't worry about it i'm just tying them in right now because i want them to get up as quickly as possible and tying in is the same for any plant it's always loose around the stem and tight around the stake so you do a figure of eight and then you double up around the stake just so it won't move around hopefully they'll grow away now this garden's looking a little bit bare and i need to find a plant that will flower its socks off continuously all summer long in a complementary palette to these sweet peas which are the geoff hamilton percy thrower alan titchmarsh and monty don which are all in a kind of pink to dark pink palette so what i've done is i've got hold of some knautia macedonica now this looks very similar to a scabious it comes from the balkans and it is just a fantastic plant if you're gonna buy one thing buy this because whatever the weather it will flower its socks off continuously all summer long it's just really value for money and it's a lovely sort of deep dark kind of pinky purple so i think it will be very complementary so i'm just going to dot it around and to bulk up supplies i have a friend who has a pastel pink version in his garden and it's self seeded itself all over the place so i've managed to get a few off him now knautia likes to grow in sort of full sun to partial shade and it's particularly drought tolerant so it's good if you've got a little baked back garden they're such healthy strong growing happy plants that you really just have to shove them in the ground and give them a water and i guarantee they'll be off i also guarantee they'll self seed themselves all over your garden so you will have plenty of these to come which is no bad thing cos you can start giving them away to friends
absolutely no prizes for guessing what i've chosen for the best of berryfields this week how could it have been anywhere else but in the long borders with these glorious tulips such an incredibly flamboyant show burns your retina to look at them and just cheers you up monty planted two thousand tulips in here last november and he planted them some for an earlier show and some for a later show but we've had such a weird season that they've all come at once so what else is there to do than make the most of them glorious rich colours like abu hassan with these mahogany flowers yellow edged and then these fantastic lily flowered tulips such a beautiful elegant shape and parrot tulips with these great flowering petals really totally over the top i just love them all well joe's really getting into his allotment now he's had some very unconventional ideas and also planted some rather unusual crops but this week he's concentrating on some of those staples that you always associate with allotmenteering
joe what on earth are you doing
yeah because it's been there don't do much work
oh it doesn't do much work it's lazy you can't blame the barrow it's the barrow wrangler get it working the more it works the less it'll squeak i've got to do my beans
yeah you do try and keep the volume down on that flippin' barrow
next thing to do is give it a bit of a feed i'm using some of this just fish blood and bone just a general feed i'm gonna put a few handfuls of that be quite liberal with it sprinkle it on top of the grass and also onto the soil that i'm backfilling with as well so it just gets nicely mixed up just generally into all the soil next thing to do is to backfill the trench with the soil so the next thing is to get the structure in everyone seems to do it differently the main thing is just to do it as wide as the the pit that you've dug so there and then there then tie them together at the top there are no special knots in this it is isn't it it really is well we were up here pretty much must have been five or six hours yesterday with cath and the kids um and cath weeded over all those diamond and triangular beds i mean meticulously i think she finds it quite therapeutic right and now for the beans i'm gonna put one variety on one half and another on the other half and i'm going to use white beans these haricot beans they look delicious and then these these are cobra these are a climbing french bean you're meant to get so many beans off them they're quite prolific so i'm gonna go for those right so i'm going to pop them in i'm gonna put two against each cane and the reason for that is so that black ones on this side cobra on this side one gone in there and then one pretty much next to it just on the side so that the weaker one i take out i'm left with the nice strong one i'm planting them also and this is a really good tip that i read on the inside of the canes if you plant on the outside of the canes you've got to straggle them over a bit but also for hoeing here i can get the hoe and hoe all the way through here and i can't get onto the inside cos the bamboo's stopping me there's actually a physical barrier it's a brilliant way for me to learn that's what i love about it i'm not a person with a formal education study the books and work out how to do it but by doing this i'll never forget any of this you know potatoes seven different varieties i know which are earlies and lates the beans how to plant beans how to grow them and then when i've been through the process of actually harvesting them i'll know all about beans and peas and artichokes and salads and onions and shallots suddenly your whole range expands it's pretty exciting it's great i'm really enjoying it well we've been talking about the way people garden is changing that allotment has completely changed the way i garden back here in the small patio garden i'm getting these window boxes up i've got one already up planted and this one i'm gonna finish off i'm lining it with an old compost bag just like i did with the terracotta pot it helps with moisture retention and protect the wood at the same time now i'm just gonna put some compost in here and i think they look really good they've gone very well with the traditional facade of the house nothing too contemporary just going with the flow and the planting is going to be pretty traditional too just putting in some classic summer bedding so i've gone for geraniums and ivy and these are really lovely geranium fantastic red just coming into flower now and these are a fireworks variety which means they've got a really interesting cut flower on them and this one's called scarlet for obvious reasons i'm placing four of those through the centre of this window box then the ivy at the front to trail over break up the edge of the pot and then i'm gonna put a couple of these trailing bacopa these lovely white flowers a slight scent to them too just to break up the front corners and then just backfill with compost keep scooping it out loads of handfuls and firm them in as you go around making sure that you don't leave any air gaps they're gonna love it here baking sun south facing these geraniums give a mediterranean feel you see them in the mediterranean they flower all summer long keep dead heading them and they'll just keep flowering for you great value for money there you go and of course the last thing you've always got to do give them a good water in it cleans up the foliage at the same time and the windowsill looks pretty good to me now all i need here is somewhere to sit it looks pretty good doesn't it the good thing about small spaces like this is you can create a lot of impact in just a few hours
if your time in the garden is limited you really want to make the most of it if there's just one thing you do this weekend tackle newly emerging weeds use a sharp hoe to chop off the heads of annual weeds before they get into their stride choosing a warm dry day to do it follow this up with at least a two inch layer of mulch in this case we're using a straw mulch which will double as protection for the developing strawberries this should mean you won't have to waste time weeding again and instead you can spend your time with much more enjoyable activities we left rachel grappling with her hard landscaping and sorting out her structures for her chelsea show garden but now we catch up with her as she really gets to grips with her plants
the most difficult thing has been trying to do something um original and pack in lots of plants which is what i love into a five metre by five metre space i wanted to use big flowers big blousy flowers so roses and i'm going to prove i hope that you can use modern design with roses because i don't think many people do that so luckily clifton have got this bit of land which is not far from their nursery and we're literally building the garden here like a jigsaw and this looks like a big metal you know lump at the moment but that'll all be clad in slate this is effectively a planter so it'll be filled with these layers of roses also these raised beds are what came out of that original inspiration i had from the paddy fields this is the section that's worrying me this is where that sculptural structure is going along here then over here this is going to be the big cercis the forest pansy so what i need to check this afternoon we're going to waddesdon where most of the plants are i'm going to see the two big cercis that len has found for the first time and see what the spread is like while we're here now though len's going to help me he's brought a whole lot of plants up yeah that is lovely that's really nice it's different from alchemilla mollis isn't it
yeah it's a miniature alchemilla mollis much nicer
i like that fact that it's green rather than that yellow flower is this peach flambe peach flambe that you wanted
it's a nice plant i think it's great
and it will either work brilliantly with the roses we've chosen or it'll clash horribly this is lovely is that lime rickey it is yeah that's gorgeous all in all i think this is invaluable being able to do this is this the only astrantia we've got so far astrantia major's a nice one it's not often used and it's i like that slightly larger starry flower look at this not a slug in sight yeah that's all looking really good len let's go and see the cercis yeah oh gosh well from here it looks beautiful but of course i'm seeing two of them you know what is interesting they definitely have a good and bad side don't they yeah they do we've got our high wall haven't we uh huh so it's quite good if it's one sided in some respects i'm a little bit worried that they're not in tip top condition but maybe that's the wrong plant i keep forgetting that while the public see the garden from just the two angles the judges come onto the garden and see it from every angle there's no hiding place if we're gonna use this one we need to take this off and this off i'd have thought fairly quickly
well just judicious pruning isn't it
so we're here we're on site this is chelsea um it's day three of the build i can't believe how quickly the time is going it's frightening i had originally wanted this steel cable and went on about it and in the garden right next door they've got exactly that so maybe sometimes things work out for the best the judging's on monday so that's it by the time you go home sunday night i may not get home on sunday i may stay here all night i've got to go and get my posh frock at some point maybe try and wash my hair you know so i'm presentable
hello and welcome to a question of sport with the f. a. cup final taking place tomorrow we are delighted to be joined by four men who all know what it takes to win that famous trophy but who will be the victorious captain tonight will it be matt or phil well matt tonight should get plenty of help and advice because he's joined by two cup final winning captains

the cat is in goal
so daws is first up a chance to strike an early psychological blow a bit of the grobbelaars from tuffers and a very good penalty to begin with low and hard tuffers no chance so the first chance we get to see that sweet left foot of phil tufnell this to level at one to one
just underneath his body went the right way but couldn't keep it out here comes the second effort from daws
no he was always leaning back
lifted his head and that will take some looking for
hit it well again
this to take the lead for tuffers he was cool with his first effort oh and that's even cooler he might well raise his arm daws nowhere near it tuffers takes a two to one lead very important penalty for daws and didn't he keep his cool he makes it go to the last penalty tuffers didn't move this the all important one then
no
in the world cup of nineteen ninety so honours even then a two to two draw
fantastic absolutely awesome
well played mate sharing the cup
i think it's only fair because it's such a special moment
it's a lovely cup
ready congratulations tuffers congratulations mate

genesis genesis genesis genesis genesis genesis genesis genesis genesis genesis genesis genesis genesis genesis genesis
i'm kinda feeling i should've had a pee
there's time down there i wouldn't mind one
all ten drops
not for twenty five years or something right yeah
good day
hi
who's this
how are ya good
any excuse have you been waiting long
we've been waiting for you
fifteen years darling darling good to see you good to see you too
are we actually doing anything or are we just sort of saying hello
just we're doing nothing so there's always the problem the long songs are long are long they take up they take up a lot of space
domino i think of as a two part thing like homes by the sea but it isn't is it or is it domino it is a bit
there's a song part and then there's the duddle un duddle un duddle un duddle un duddle un dun i mean actually duddle un duddle un dun
we wrote all those last three or four albums together that's something i felt we had something that came out of that but none of us really did it individually we brought things out of each other
i really did i had a great time and the thing that i really enjoyed almost more than the music is the laughing we have a great time together and we play some music
in terms of playing live music um you know this is the most it's probably all i've got really and i'm proud of all the music we've done
the whole thing really is based round the fact that the two of us and with phil put us in a room and something quite special happens what time is it are we done today
we've only just started we come we made up a tune then we had lunch
it's not meant to be rehearsals today i feel we're going too fast
the cinema show there you go what's that tune
it's a decent harmony i'm quite enjoying it so far
listen getting ready to kick some ass
getting ready to try to kick some ass
it is so exciting you three guys you had a long yeah yeah terrific thing together you know
so fifteen years have passed since you've performed in the states as genesis what has made this the right time
have you asked um er your ex partner peter gabriel to come to the comeback
what peter
how hard have you tried to convince steve hackett or peter gabriel to participate in this historic reunion
well they would never have been part of this you know even if we did something with pete it would only be the lamb or leading up to it most of the material you heard today would not be included in that so this is something
it's a different project yeah different life yeah
in the cage
rock face moves to press my skin white liquids turn sour within turn fast turn sour turn sweat turn sour must tell myself that i'm not here i'm drowning in a liquid fear bottled in a strong compression my distortion shows obsession in the cave get me out of this cave
hey hey
if i keep self control i'll be safe in my soul cos this childhood belief brings a moment's relief but my cynic soon returns and the lifeboat burns
so the story is very simple you can do multiple arenas which means six to seven cities and do three to four nights in each of them or do twenty shows of a bigger stature
but again that's because we can isn't it is that definitely the right thing to do
where would we prefer to play
obviously if you do stadiums you're maximising
i think it should be stadiumed cos i see genesis pink floyd led zeppelin the great bands of all time it's big time it should be done big time and people think it is big time i think it's more special to play one larger date
the specialness is to some extent created by the fact that it's us guys together after fifteen it's not the size of it that's supposed to be special
i think there's two arguments i think we create more of a presence and if we're gonna go after this once let's make it a big presence
i just know that it's like we're missing an opportunity if we don't do this and just by nature from the speaking person i'm just a guy who wants to play a bit of music to people
i understand what you're saying about that but everybody plays arenas pop groups do three four five sets live i do four nights at wembley arena so genesis do three nights at wembley arena how exciting is that d'you see what i mean
no i just think the idea of it being something special somewhere in germany somewhere in france somewhere in england and somewhere central to a few other countries we could do four nights yeah and draw
it has suddenly occurred to me what you just said defeats the argument of playing multiple nights in arenas because you play less cities and people have to travel more
don't fuck with me john you hear what i'm saying you know what i'm saying
i was trying to be amusing i know the exclusivity is part of the appeal only twenty shows as opposed to trying to go to forty then you end up playing down the road from yourself you know i wouldn't necessarily well you do twenty shows
without the singer if you do forty shows that's one thing to bear in mind
yes so would you like the one with phil or the one without straight to the point
but i mean surely we're here to talk about the main principle of the twenty
yeah the principle of doing twenty shows than working out where the twenty shows should be
is there a choice i'd like to think there was a choice but
yeah
yeah
all right well
can you squeeze together
squeeze me
again please
thank you thank you very much thanks yep that's all we can do you've got two books if you start on page one you see the conversation i had with patrick which is in blue we talked about various ways of doing interesting things at the end of a stadium one idea which is illustrated in the first few pages is of having a lot of towers which can have lights that pan up and down them and then i finally got to page five where i firmed this up into a sort of number one possible firm idea the fact that as a band you take up very little space one thing which would be very interesting to do would be to put you in a capsule and change the position of that capsule relative to the backdrop almost as a caravan as a vehicle as a pod and it's basically on a giant forklift truck that we build as part of the backdrop which started off at the front of the stage like this got picked up and did this and flew back and and it's shown here up in the air in this sketch this is this thing
and you fill the space underneath with video picture
hrrm i do suffer quite badly from vertigo
yeah
i just thought i'd mention that before
you could get off just before we'll give you a green light i don't mind sending the singer up
erm i don't know we could well we need to come back to that one
genesis are at their best in concert nearly everywhere they play they take the audience by storm and last year they were voted number one live band in the world
if you go back to the early days of genesis they were always theatrical they were always three dimensional if you go back to when peter was there watcher of the skies with the make up and the bat wings it was a very three dimensional look you'd get this you'd get this depth in the stage
we've always you know had a big visual show in the early days we didn't have helpers we just did it ourselves back in the days of the lamb lies down on broadway and the ideas sort of came from within the group and we expanded on them we even got people to help us but it very much started with us and over the years you start to find people who you can get your ideas through and who've got practically minded people who can get it to the next stage
but i think generally we've always all of us have had a theatrical kind of taste
is that new yeah
i mean really new yeah
i got an electric guitar cut it in half
you cut it you cut it in half
it's like the top one's a bit far that way
you wanna kind of go don't you so my name's mike my guitar's a bit off centre
one two three four five six
there's another couple of bars there i'm still going i'm still creating you need me don't you d'you need more of me
pa d. a. pa d. a. pa pa pa
one two thee four five six
sly and the family stone
oh yeah nice
good is it for real huh now you've gotta do it for real
scary actually i'm scared
it's based on a rhythm thing you know so i've gotta find out what that rhythm felt like don't worry about it it's not your problem it's my problem every instrument needs you need to rehearse you need to practise on your own and you know those guys aren't the type to do that you know and i am and maybe chester is so it wasn't as hard for us
it's fine it's about now somebody said this to me the other day
all right and here is the stadium show a rendition all these bits you know they come down you remember that i think so it's what we saw before it's just so to put it in context phil i've got a drawing here just so you know what kind of light there you are
the stage we're on is quite small we might have to make some adjustments do you think that the stage that the band's on a bit small
you're kidding me no
i think we can probably make adjustments
we've got a huge stage and it's not big enough
no the area we're in is raised up isn't it the bit we're on how can it be small we've got sixty eight fucking metres wide but the bit we're on the raised up bit we're on is very tight
oh dear right
we haven't quite worked that one out yet
you're coming to the wrong bit
d. a. chuk
even if it's a blank one yeah i like that
yeah you know that push that blat um blat um blat um
unless you go to the blag um blag um blag um blag um blag um uh
yeah i mean considering we're playing in caves and giant places you almost need a bigger gap to make it work you know to make it
anyway
tony and mike together are more of the spirit of genesis than me you know it's like people just don't know they think the singer's the guy that does it all and that's the link and that's always been the problem they thought peter gabriel did it all it wasn't that way
from a stage point of view without people like that who can communicate with a crowd you can't get anywhere but from the point of view of the music the writing it's always been one of my major roles in this group to write music cos back in the time when pete first left mike and i definitely did the lion's share of the writing even before that but in the later part phil's contribution came to more of a level with ours that was the thing i'd say a very much even thing on those last two genesis albums
hey mike how are you good morning
this is what you get for ten million is it yeah get my bearings first of all
yeah that's the thing isn't it it's hard to remember what nights used to be like isn't it yeah all this stuff the guy with a pole banging a par lamp to try and get it yes yeah the gel burning through you know
these are really good these have some nice effects on them too unusual effects
do the trip out dave we found a really good thing on the
brow oh i see oh right the red snake
the red snake
you all right
oh there you go whoa
if you're gonna have design by committee which to a degree this is then you've gotta have a committee that thinks alike otherwise it definitely isn't gonna work i think certainly with tony and mike they have clear ideas of what they don't want they don't necessarily come with view of exactly what they want they just know what they don't want
let's turn the lights off a minute let's just see what the screens are like i think it should be behind the bars
yeah
no i wanna go to the next half now from the beginning all right
you want the second half yeah o. k. and you don't care we'll do the second half all right four more times and run through it if you wanna run through it before we run through it another thirty times going through the motions of i know we need to do it but it's just it's boring doing it here
that's life that's called rehearsal three four
in silence and darkness i didn't listen to the songs' apart from what i'd listened to in the car with my kids so i hadn't heard domino for example until we actually had to play it and it was like god it was amazing how quickly it came back and it was also amazing how difficult it was still to sing some obscure genesis lyrics you know being a kind of direct emotional writer singer you know i say i love you and i miss you and i want you whatever it is and now i've got to sing sheets of double glazing and nylon sheets and blankets and it's i dunno how to do that i never did know how to do that and um i realised that i was a caricature in some respects very over the top i hate it actually i can't really watch it but i've just decided to stand there and sing it you know i can't can't do it any other way and if anybody expects me to it won't happen you know
but that's the placing as well
i think it's a placing and i think it's where it is
you're not trying to make decisions are you i'm sure if it was a keyboard player
i could find someone could i suggest some later suggestions
we could put ripples after mama yeah it's connoisseur stuff this they'll love it but you've got to help them back a bit you buy their goodwill you slip one in without them knowing you've bought your goodwill
that's quite nice yeah
marching to the promised land where the honey flows and takes you by the hand pulls you down on your knees while you're down
i suppose in the past every tour was part of an ongoing tour and album it was quite an everyday part of your life and we haven't done it for a long time i also think that doing the book had an effect on us while we rehearsed seeing that passage of time over the last forty years and reading about yourselves which we can't forget it had an effect on me it made you appreciate what we have together
sail away
although we know it we're english so we never say it out loud and made us think what a great time it's been
you realise what we meant to each other without each other saying it which is kind of interesting and it's appropriate that when you get to this kind of period in your life you know putting things away and despatching them it's nice to have done it
how much of your life do you actually spend on the road uh
i'm told it's seven months of the year but it never actually feels like that cos it's split up quite a lot i've been playing in professional bands since i was about fourteen so i've been on the road a while one of the reasons i was so keen to do this
is i felt that it would be for phil it would be like coming home with the responsibilities of being phil collins and all that goes with that and having to run the whole show on his solo stuff and having all this other stuff going on in his private life at the same time i think it was just a burden
it's part of what comes when you become very famous like he has sometimes it seems to drag this other stuff with it and it's the price you pay when he decided to be the singer it was sort of the moment when everything was set in motion and some of the things are gonna happen that will make personal life more difficult cos that's what tends to happen singers are in the middle of the stage everyone sees them they're not left alone that's quite tough i wouldn't wanna do it
i can't do everybody though it's not fair you know i'm sorry nikolai nikolai
we're just testing them one by one can you do them all at once
do not fire before i tell you
there's one missing
do little ones little back back back
it's impressive but is it genesis sometimes it's just that sort of moment that takes it over a limit with this kind of spectacle you're always working on the limits of what's tasteful and what's not we need to try and stay within that tastefulness that just takes it to the other side and you see the whole thing differently it's fun to watch it doesn't do much for me
i would describe tony as the conscience of the band it's not to deny that everyone else had a very very important role and are strong writers in their own right as they've proved but for tony genesis was his solo career
it's much closer to the kind of thing i do on my solo albums so if you like the brazilian you should go and buy them which no one does i tend to try to take the group a little bit away from doing just the straight pop songs all the time i love doing pop songs and some of those ones i've been very involved in but i kind of like to make sure we do a bit more of the other songs like domino and home by the sea the others enjoyed it as well it's not really like that when left to their own devices as you can see with the solo albums they tend to both do things that are more concise i'm the other way given half a chance and on my last solo album i had an eighteen minute song it's cos that's what gives me pleasure i think that's what i do best just doing everything using the three four five chord basic stuff i don't mind a bit of that but i don't want it all the time the whole section
is not quite right yet when the man is little it becomes secondary when it starts it starts great then it goes up to the big face that comes in like that great then phil comes in and there's no big men till the keyboard solo
the keyboard solo could have a running man
a little man coming in there little men going past big to small yeah little men going away so there's not always a figure right there sort of stuff going on the trouble is that a big man all the time takes over a little man i think is the same job
why don't you do that
up to that big face is great then you start a lot of stuff i think keep a lot of the big men out after that till after
maybe they can come in at the keyboard side of it
the solo yeah keyboard solo stay small to the keyboard solo
there's an interesting review in england that said mike rutherford was outgunned by his second guitarist daryl stuermer and the guy missed the point completely the fact that mike's playing lead guitar is not because he thinks he is the best lead guitar player in the world it's the fact that he wrote the music
i do most of the work i write the songs and i sing and i drum and i play keyboards but i have to give tony and phil a bit of credit so they don't feel left out
mike is a really creative writer and comes up with some very off the wall stuff and also gives the balls to the band his bass playing and guitar playing he's more rock and roll he's more of a rock i suppose the difference is that tony was a beatles fan mike was a rolling stones fan round round round round round somebody somebody get me out of this cage get me out of this cage get me out of this cage
errors problems for everyone it's just right
are we going to do another rehearsal tonight
right i don't know why so many things don't happen when they should i don't see much but when i do see it it's wrong that's a shame really
is it being run where's it being run from ask tom where are we going to run the video from
it will be behind the stage
the way it works maybe ten cues
i don't think it's something the lighting operator can do at the same time
we agree it's not
it's a case by case basis if the video operator if they've got a cue list a written down score for instance we are going to jam this much
the problem we have is that he needs to be on his toes as sometimes the songs are different
there will be a guy dedicated to only thinking about pressing the button at exactly the right time he doesn't have any other responsibility
who is this are you the guy
it's about to happen when
the visual side has always been important to us it's something i really enjoyed and not being a very visual performer i'm aware that we need visual help in the early days obviously we developed the vary light and now that look is totally ubiquitous everybody uses that hundreds of times when we first used it the effect that had the first tour suddenly you had all these lights up there and they went from red to blue just like that no one had seen anything like it we just used simple things we used to have half the lights in red and half in green then alternated them with the lights in strange positions it was a staggering effect no one had seen anything like it it's difficult to be as revolutionary as that but you hope to use things in a way that is new
just a little time
i'm in between i'm concerned but i think it can be dealt with
the days go by and it's still so a long way away
i think we go the screen things tonight and get the cueing system right then we'll get it right i'm still worried about the guys
he needs to practice so much cos the guy's been brought in you know
richard has all the cues at night when i go back rehearsing all the songs then coming back in the morning to rehearse the songs
we need to get you two more time together
i'm trying to think of the most useful sleep pattern there isn't one is there
no
hi this is tony banks i'm mike rutherford
and phil collins genesis you're listening to wcsx
phil collins we're genesis and you're listening to mix one thousand sixty five fuck
hi this is tony banks i'm mike rutherford
i'm phil collins we're genesis you're listening to mix one hundred five i'm a professional the last ten twelve years more recently people have been really a lot looser i'm getting on better with tony banks now than i ever have done we always got on but i really i really feel like i understand him now for the first time certainly to this extent
i'm a lot mellower than i was you know i was pretty difficult when he first knew me perhaps we were just sort of crossing over
when you're young and determined to prove you're right you never say i don't feel that strongly about this when we were younger about thirty we'd never say that you'd always say oh no i go that way so as you get older you're more honest with yourself
hi this is tony banks
do it properly i did i was doing that as a practise
hi this is mike rutherford i'm phil collins
i've got a bad stomach michelle michelle michelle
you're all having a good time down there aren't you
is there a problem is there a problem
is there some problem with the system or
should we get back to dominoes
but we never saw those dominoes because you were going oh fuck we've fucked it up you thought you'd fucked up the landscape
we've sat down and yeah exactly we need a cue list
which is that which we should have from screens production whatever that is
which we can tie into the song which we then put into the lyrics
what we would in t. v. land call the script
it worries me if you're relying on lyrics or things like that or visual cues you have to have something to base it on
you can't just have it in your head
you have to you have to you've gotta know the music
you've gotta know the music but you need aides to help you you need do you know what i mean some of these cues there is nothing but the music i don't know exactly where those cue points are um who does
but that's the nature of that system
well then it's the wrong fucking system frankly we need that flexibility
all right that's our homework for tonight we'll do these notes we have to have it right tomorrow
we're in big trouble i think
we'll run through it but i've changed all the media this is now the upres media i haven't checked oh do another one do another one do another one do another one five minutes to check through we're just checking through right now
what was it is there a problem they want to do it again do what they wanna do it again
they've got a terrible problem i'd rather see it from the beginning
let's just let if we can get it now then we'll know it's right how are you guys now brian we're standing by whenever you like
go go go
we're almost up some things were there something's worked there
richard tony's got a question
well there must be a way of continuing to run on that screen and taking it out on that screen
there there is a way of blackening yes
hang on explain how it goes out
i mean let's put this another way excuse me
i prefer the stool
right
and you're in the wrong cue you're too early you're too late you say i'm gonna wait leave the screen break and jump in on the vortex cue which happens to be two cues on do you have to step through them or do you have to load them and step through the cues why can't you go back it would always be a go forward not a go back even jump two cues if you're worried about getting there in time much rather see an empty screen
you just need fucking dominoes bouncing around at the end even if it's the wrong cues
i i i really honestly believe is give brian the time to rehearse things like domino and get it right on the button
for the last bit it's really hard to find you a cue
you show us where the cue is so we know just go back
where the double drums start that's fine there
next in line next in line you've got to go
cos there's nothing there's nothing you can do when you're next in line cos there's nothing no there's nothing there's nothing you can do when you're next in line you've got to go you've got to go you've got to go you've got to go domino
the rest of us are doing very good
it's the most it is a kind of crucial song
yeah if we get it wrong we'll get it really wrong that's the trouble
well if you get in trouble cut
with everything else it's great
morning
they're all queuing at the hotel so we came down early
did they manage to change the audio on the intro or was i believe so
i got a new can we hear on these speakers here
why has it stopped is that what we're doing no no no it's stopped for a very good reason
because it's cued up the next piece that's a damn good point because what we need to do how are we gonna get out of this one
the p. a.'s further back than usual is it not no same place
anything else why are my rain covers in denmark because they because they were put on the wrong truck no they weren't made in time to get to brussels
get your excuses together guys same one you know so if it rains it's not gonna rain good
are we ready

today that the result of march's presidential election had been disastrous a date for a second election has been set for june the opposition leader morgan tsvangirai has told our correspondent he will contest the run off but has also negotiated the possibility of a power sharing dealing deal you may find soft of the images in this report disturbing a warm welcome for a leader facing the fighting of his life morgan tsvangirai making a brief appearance in belfast on the eve of returning to his homeland the hopes of many are resting on his shoulders and his message here that president mugabe's downfall is inevitable in an earlier b. b. c. interview he said the ruling party is making overtures about a national unity government
we've said look you have to demonstrate to us you have cheated before you have to give us the
we're not putting any preconditions if we're saying to them no preconditions equally so they're not putting any preconditions we're talking about the country's future
back in zimbabwe president mugabe's mind
we look back on the year and say what lessons can we learn what can we do better what are we we determined to address and how can we deliver better service for our custodyeners zblnd at service is getting better at terminal five where grateful for one decision he had
they've shrunk into profitability unlike many airlines in the world that will press on on regardless building and building market share they've looked at the bits that make money and concentrated on that

they say it's the end of the nice decade so time for a rethink on economic policy
ambassador james mcgee left harare with counterparts from britain japan and the e. u. to check out the situation in the countryside for themselves according to the zimbabwe government they broke a rule saying they shouldn't have gone more than twenty five miles from the capital without special permission they were stopped though the ambassador insists that the zimbabwe government was at fault
so there were six diplomats in this convoy they illegal asked us to accompany them to a police station which contravenes all the vienna conventions that anyone knows of we refuelsed to go l. did not go to a police station it's illegal for them to ask that there was no way we were going to a police station we were illegally detained on the side of the road for an hour until they found out that we should go
ambassador mcgee's findings are backed up by those of the british journalist peter oborne some of his pictures are very disturbing indeed this is a picture you took in a hospital of woman victim of the violence what are we looking at here
these are her buttocks she was beaten with a rod two people taking turns to beat her for half an hour it's gone straight through the muscle tissue destroyed the muscle tissue and made two holes the size of grape fruits there are a lot of reports of injuries like that coming back because they beat them so hard there's a real passion and ferocity about this a lot of people get beaten to death it's got to be borne in mind this is part of an election campaign this is planned violence planned by the joc the central committee of hard liners top military men and policemen who are loyal to mugabe they're going out there fighting their election by driving the m. d. c. away from the places where they can vote targeting the party organisation so that any m. d. c. activists or organiser will get sought out and
majority in parliament although the presidential result did not yield an outright winner it was also it was indeed disastrous
the m. d. c.'s morgan tsvangirai secured forty seven point eight per cent of the presidential vote but needed over fifty per cent to be declared the winner hence the run off he's
been out of the country for over
against innocent civilians who dared to vote to rid themselves of this evil regime
tonight morgan tsvangirai's flying back to africa it's thought he could return to zimbabwe at long last tomorrow and is due to address a rally on sunday he has little choice but it could be a dangerous move
he might get shot he might get arrested on arrival he's had death threats very deliberately laid against him
so in a situation like this can there still be fair election
given the situation on the ground no fair elections are not possible there needs to be much much more political space to allow people to do two things number one the people need to be assured that their personal safety sen sured
today ambassador james mcgee was given first warning by zimbabwe's foreign minister and told that any interference in zimbabwe's internal affairs will not be tolerated wilf mbanga is the editor of the zimbabwean paper he was expelled from zimbabwe thanks for joining us this evening amnesty international says that the violence in your country is at breaking point from what you know from people back home how
as you point out this is part of an election campaign if the run off isn't until the end of june there's a fair chance this kind of intimidation will work at the polls
well what mugabe is trying to do is to displace five hundred thousand people five hundred thousand voters because he lost to morgan tsvangirai by that much majority so he wants to make sure that he displaces five hundred thousand people in other words they won't be eligible to vote in the next election that way he'll get in
he takes part in the election some people have said he's legitimising this illegal process but if he doesn't then mugabe gets in by default then we have more suffering for the next five years is that what we want
mbeki is an honest broker he's admitted that he's been backing mugabe all along
do they think anyone else would do better
they've suggested the zambian president who is also the chairman of the sadec region but she's unaccepted to mugabe so it's not going to work sadc itself is appointed mbeki as their point men it's with mbeki but mbeki has discredited himself his own party is distancing itself from him he's been a disaster
what about the monitors they themselves are being intimidated under this round what chance is there of getting a fair
they now look silly
when you have such a catastrophe such a devastation you need help from outside the can't do a it alone it is a very of emergency in fact time is life if they don't don't realise that they will consider being responsible the worst hit part of burma is the irrawaddy delta a vast populous and usually fertile place water dominates everything here all the more so now bridges have been swept away and power supply lost and the government closed the area off
they feel the risk of popular anger and resentment about what has taken place of course it is not their fault there's a natural disaster like a earthquake a lot of people a lot of peasants and ordinary workers will be thinking why do schools fall in when buildings the same heights don't fall in why are we given a warning of three hundred ninety dams that might burst why do bridges fall in and hospitals at risk why are buildings built by the state collapsing while others are standing everyone knows that palm have be agreesed
hu jintao china's president followed his prime minister in visiting the disaster area our is growing about the relief effort as a british teacher in chengdu explains
the school where more than one thousand students were buried the earthquake has touched such deep emotions in china there are bound to be aftershocks social and political batina lusha from the world food programme joins me looking at burma this time last week the situation grave food impounded by the authorities who wanted to stop northern aid getting in do you believe that situation
clearly we are only at twenty per cent of capacity and our number one goal is to feed the hungary are you hearing a hungary are you hearing a softening from the authorities what negotiations are taking place
we're always in contact with the authorities and officials in myanmar our people on the ground we would like to bring for example a helicopter to transport food to the far outlying areas which are so hard to access we have been able to get some boats and they deliver food to some of these areas we have been hiring trucks but they are only small trucks we can only
isn't inflation justifiable fear the target we have set has served the country extremely well for the past decade what times are good it has worked why would you get rid of it
it's not necessarily you want to get rid of the whole idea what is clear you need to adjust the appropriate inflation target if you'll stick within the inflation targeting framework for instance we know no matter what you do you'll be faced with increases in the price of energy and the price of food and those increases will feed through the system now why would you want to strangle the rest of the economy in order to get inflation down to a myth kael ash trarly chosen number it makes it more difficult for the economy to go through the adjustments needed
arbitrary are you saying we should use another arbitrary number what would it be
governor or the treasury said let's adjust the inflation target we would laugh in his face won't we
that's one of the reasons countries made a mistake to get to wedded to the notion of inflation targeting they should have said it's one of
the objectives they will get
very important one the federal reserve board in the united states has focused on inflation but also on unemployment and economic growth and that is why right now it sees the dangers of recession are much greater than inflation it and it lowered the interest rates markedly in response to that what it is saying is policy is an important tool but it's
burying my dog is more important than you being unfaithful she's right come on louise let's take care of this first
that everything yeah from mum's my clothes are at janet and jon's
mum's got my collection of bulbous fruit you collect them as well amazing where do you keep yours
i don't because it's sad we'll have to establish some ground rules you can't bring handicapped fruit into the house
i don't want rules to live by i pay half the rent i can do what i want
don't you think that's selfish yeah don't you think that also gives me licence to do what i like i suppose so i'm capable of far more disgusting things than you you do wipe your knob on the curtains after sex so life will be easier for us both if there's a bit of give and take
i won't bring the fruit if you stop the crusty curtains act
donna that's just the beginning what else i'm perfect to live with in every other way you smoke it's part of who i am it's in my blood and in your hair and in your clothes you stink you smell like a big rancid pond
at least i know how i'm gonna die
don't smoke in the flat not even in the bathroom no if i've had curry we could end up in wigan
i'll go out on the fire escape to smoke good
compromise is good we're a good couple as long as you go out there to fart you can't ask me to do that it'll take the fun out of it what about in winter it'd freeze on its way out i'd have an icicle stuck out me arse it would melt the neighbours downstairs would think i was a bloody weirdo
this is getting us nowhere i've got an idea what
we'll each write a list what kind of list like a list of demands annoying habits we want rid of
won't it highlight the flaws in our relationship
we'll see which ones we agree on and the others we compromise on from that little acorn a mighty oak of a relationship will grow
gaz yeah you been reading my woman's own

so you fancied him and thought you'd throw away three years with me for a pathetic snog no
you're right it was pathetic it didn't mean anything he didn't even feel my bum i'm going out please just wait a minute
i've gotta think i don't know what to do see you later don't try and kiss me i'd rather kiss a salty old condom
boooo janet what do you want i'm working really hard trying to look busy oh that jonny business that was just too funny don't call me a haemorrhoid well i can't come over i told you i'm busy janet stop shouting you're in a library mmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmm what was that noise i was just clearing my throat nothing to be concerned about love i'm not dying not yet what are you talking about most parents die when their children fly the roost i could be on my way out you've still got two kids here they don't count they lead their own lives i rely on you for company sat there smoking your pipe watching emmerdale i've never smoked a pipe you're thinking of granddad happen i am you're very similar mum i'm not like granddad he's seventy years old he hates women and he's dead maybe love maybe but loneliness does strange things to a woman you can talk to gran i don't wanna hang round with my flamin' mother it's too sad for words that's what you do
get the rest of your stuff love yes donna you go
enjoy your youth while you can cos when it's gone it's gone i'll just sit here and rot get a hobby join a group those friendship groups are full of one eyed freaks called colin go to church they've got loads of events christmas.and easter they've probably got loads more since i last went
these yours what's in them
they'll be full of large pants and dildos i don't own sex toys aw i put that on my list that i wasn't allowed any which ones to bring what's this about a list we're making a list of demands it won't work why not his will be blow jobs yours'll be hoovering you're obsessed with suction you can't make demands on each other you have to sort of drift through a relationship compromising on the way
if we set down the rules we'll never argue
my saturdays are my saturdays you can't take them away i can if i write it on the list
i wrote it first
no you didn't look at that
it's shorthand you don't know shorthand i make it up stupid
and so it begins think jonny's going to dump you would you in an instant look at the state of you
i'm a mess aren't i jonny's never gonna want me back
cheer up janet there's plenty more freaks in the circus
louise you're supposed to be helping me jonny wouldn't know about andy if it wasn't for you and your big fat gob i do not have a big fat gob
i have delicate bee stung lips louise you're not helping you should thank me i might have saved you from a life of squalor we don't live in squalor janet most people's carpets aren't made of food
can't you see what'll happen course i can
you and jonny will break up then you can hang around me fetching me things and buying me gifts my life will be complete it's perfect
this is so unfair why did i have to tell him i don't know maybe it's because deep down i don't really like you and if you and jonny break up i won't have to see you again
really don't worry janet i'll get you back together
then we can go back to pretending to like each other again
pint please all right jon
brilliant my girlfriend's snogging other blokes i've had the worst interview of my life and i've lost one of my shoes life couldn't get better no hold on here comes a fat bloke called barry to sit on my face
how have you lost a shoe i threw it at a small child why
cos it was looking at me funny donna's all moved in
i'm celebrating shouldn't you celebrate together she's celebrating by making my tea
what are you having dunno i imagine it'll be a pie of some sort can i come
things still not great
did she look like she was really into him they were kissing for a long time not by my standards oh god
i do remember one thing yeah she pulled away from him and and then she vomited did she yeah then she went ughhh really loudly
what did he do then he went
i was nearly believing you then
it was the chicks that did it wasn't it
would you dump donna like a shot really yeah but i've got more chance of getting a girlfriend yeah true let it strain through my memory like a pan of infidelity stew
you can't forget some bloke's hands all over her you never said his hands were all over her i didn't mean just her top half what over her tits they're mine more like her back not her back just the back of her head
he had both his hands on the back of her head he had small hands i'm never gonna get over this
why jonny why why why louise what is up with you this is the end of everything everything i've come to rely on everything i need to be stable
this is you stable it's nothing to do with you it's between me and janet don't be so selfish
think how it'll affect me how it don't affect me oh but it will donna's janet's best friend so so she'll take her side and you'll take jonny's then the cracks will show and you'll split up as well then you'd avoid each other then you'd all get new partners well except for you jonny hey when i'd meet you in the street i'd have to do this face cos i'd pity you and i don't like feeling pity pity is for the weak and the ugly
so really this is all about you obviously that's incredibly selfish obviously you're not a complete dickhead i know you've given me an idea one where we can all stay together and jonny gets to do everything his own way
you'll forgive her i knew it would work i'm janet's best friend tell donna to shove that up her arse
i do all the time it never works
laters
so what's your idea then
how was janet when you left her today
um pretty bad i guess i think she'd been crying but she's always snotty eyed in the morning
she'd do anything to make herself feel better yeah i would
i'd buy myself a lovely big cake
you see how it can work for you i can get her to buy me a cake you can get her to do anything cos it'd make her feel better exactly and i wouldn't have to do anything yep
she could be my slave i could get her to walk around naked

i will hire a driver on monday
if you need
is this a smart picture
i am a professor and this gave professors a bad name it is one of those arrogant american films that assumes we are happy to sit and watch american academics that chuntering in deep voices the men have always got deep voices and they spout tripe they say the world is a chair suddenly sarah jessica parker drifts in from diagnosis murder it is not as good as the squid and the whale which is a great film this is the squid and the whale made with a meccano
adopted brother he is one of those people that can say something and he has a funny voice do you know
he has the liveliest thing in it l. agree that it is not only a stupid film but it assumes its audience is stupid that is what i had trouble with it spends its time telling us rather than showing us what is going on there is that infuriating soundtrack the acoustic guitar playing out all of the emotion and they have to speak their feelings they say things like i have not had any major epiphanies it is like they have to spell it out
you have ellen page who i thought was terrific as the young republican you have thomas hayden who is a terrific actor what about dennis quaid
he has a fantastic face no doubt about it both of the lead men have fantastic faces you can see their life in the face to me it was not a performance i agree he is trying to play it down and make it less than it should be it felt like the scenes dribbled away they were doing the things you would tell people not to do in a writing
i suppose the idea was that she was so hard to mask the fact that her mother had died and the father was all over the place and the children were holding it together which is not uncommon
and the sun was great but none of the actors were
where did you get that
in the closet
i told
him it was women's college
it is caroline's sweat shirt
sweat shirt please do not repay it rip it
her attractive
that is something
i never watched sex in the city because it got on my nerves sex and the city but yeah she is not bad looking
at the end of the scene there is a bit of music to
it was also the composing debut of the composer were you concerned about the music
he is the bloke with a very long over conditioned hair who was in a group called extreme who had a horrible song called more than words compared to that this is quite good the music in there
there is a market for this kind of film because the squid and the whale a whole load of indie films
it is a bit in the sundance mould l. sat in a cinema in north london where people had paid to see it why can't we make a film about staffordshire university
we could not do it because we ago could not do those utterances in those deep dark voices
i demand the right to corrupt reply
are you mr. turner
now it is their time if you continue to disrupt the meeting
i think you'll find mr. mussolini's methods were more drastic than asking people to leave
and speaks like her from what i remember that is the best that of the programme for me the fact that she is like that l. think it is an interesting subject to make a programme about but unfortunately i found it a little bit like an episode of heartbeat you know it did not really it seems a weird programme for the b. b. c. to make because it has an ambivalent attitude towards the director general of the b. b. c. at the time it shows him looking at women's bottoms a lot and i don't know it is a weird thing because obviously julie walters is very good so you empathise with mary white house
she said she wanted it to be very benign very cosy
yeah l. l. don't know i suppose if you think about what telly is like an owl filth is everywhere isn't it there are channels devoted to it what telly is like now l. suppose maybe she did have a point in some way which i never thought i would save then again the b. b. c. was doing some quite if she had had her way where would we be now we probably would not be sat round this table
highlighted a lot l. liked the way that it was looking in parody way about television i liked it a lot it was meant to be about the thing like the thing about the
women's institute strippers l.
thought julie walters was fantastic because it gave you that human side to mary white house people my age remember her as parody cartoon we saw the glasses saw that we never saw her as an art teacher with her husband that fantastic bit with her husband when she took her glasses off people my age would have thought she never had sex but she did l. know she ended up with terribly right wing views but i liked the beginning when she was a human being who had to make human decisions
and the chairman is a much more conservative character
we cannot run our own show any more the
i suggest that if it is a matter of censorship it is not thrust to decide to censor her
it is meant to be based on mary white house's biography but you think they would delve into hugh carlton greene's character as well
been for mary white house there would not be a nine o'clock watershed
it makes it so much about these individuals never actually meeting but would there be no nine o'clock watershed or would somebody else had stepped into those shoes it plays with the idea of how much the individual can affect social change and shows how she describes herself as finger in the dyke
cosy and domestic and was suddenly attacking people
i thought they showed that the more attention she got the more her vanity grew the slide from concern into obsession i thought that was tracked quite interestingly once you start looking for filth you really start looking for it
t. v. creates monsters filth is on b. b. c. twenty one win so twentieth may the question of whether it is possible to do good if a corrupt society is at the heart of bertolt brecht's play the good soul of szechuan the play which has been revived this week in the first major production in london for almost two decades marks the return to the stage for jane horrocks in david harrower's new translation directed by richard jones the young vic theatre has been turned into a factory in mid twentieth century china three gods come to earth to find out if there are any good people in the town horrocks plays the corrupt shui ta and another good character
it you did what we said we'd set up a base first
her face is dropping too you noticed
emily we all walked through the stage set to take through a factory to take our seats did you like the theatricality of it
spent in a long time
literally as
well as physically i get i'm not a massive theatre goer any way i couldn't get with it at all i didn't really understand why they would revive it it seemed like maybe when it was written in the forties it seemed a bit pertinent or something but why you would revive it now it seems a bit kind of after the event l. don't know i spent the last twenty minutes with my eyes closed because i couldn't bear to be there any more
that's right and how on earth can you live what i liked best about it was i've seen the show several times my son was in it in youth theerter l. couldn't fathom it this is a new translation of a shorter version that brecht was maybe going to do as a hollywood film l. l. can understand it now l. get it much more than before
what about jane horrocks chef holds centre stage and do you really feel the other characters match up in any way
yeah i think the water seller his performance is fantastic astonishing performance at the start moving around on the stage we were transfixed looking at him then coming out and the physical activity the language of it yeah those performances were good jane horrocks we're talking about julie walters earlier another stand out performance couldn't take your eyes off her even though she's very slight she seemed to command the stage
richard jones has directed lots of operas and there was music done for this for david sawyer i take it you feel the same about the music
pigs might fly
they had to illustrate it with those snouts
it was just you know i shouldn't really say much about it because i don't think
would it not perhaps been better to have updated to completely update it to the modern day
brecht was emphatic about being set in china
that was brecht
there are relevant points in it one of the major plot turn sz when shen te gets pregnant she starts running a factory and exploiting people and selling drugs and she says it's all for the child it's all for the child l. really enjoyed the question that raised of how much do you need for the child when is enough enough
just heard that's quite good and there's one other i think then the rest of it is filler l. didn't know that thing about being an a and amp r. person that should have alerted me they're the worst people in the music ipbldstri they're usually blokes they travel around with their expense account and usually have some form of leather jacket and kind of go and listen to bands and try and hang out and be mates with them in a way i think it shows on this record it's what i would call in a way consumer music it's like it all a lot of things reference other things that you've heard it's tasteful and it's like the choice of the discerning consumer but there's not much feeling of any personality of something of her in it
well it is a real mesh of genres it's very easy when you're first listening to play that find the influence game i spent my first listen through thinking it's like blondie it's the police that and that then i didn't do that when i kept on listening to it l. really enjoyed it without disagreeing with what you're saying i could imagine my eight year old really enjoying this
my son will love it
i mean would disagree the lyrics are so abstract they're not about anything other than a mood or attitude there's a lot of mill teristic language explosions tore peed yoz gun in my pocket whatever you can see from the video there's the dictator chic
that's fair enough
generally speaking yeah l. l. think that lyrics to songs only exist to be part of the song if you print them you immediately take them out of their natural habitat it's like a tiger in a zoo it's not right it's cruel
it helps you to sing along surely
that's why you have to do it because people want to know the words
if you can sing along with a song and inhabit the words if you're mumbling away if you think my ears are alight is the israelites well it helps
have you had a song where you've been singing the wrong lyrics for years
yeah it's like realising your zip's open in public
they should make up better ones
none of these would stick in your head particularly i really liked her voice as well l. think she has a lovely couple of things going on with her voice
listen for yourself santogold is on atlantic records thanks to my guests emily perkins jarvis cocker and ian mcmillan jeremy is back on monday with news night for more details and useful links to both programmes visit our website next week's review comes from the cannes film festival we discuss the foot and mouth installment of the indiana jones films we leave you with a tantalising preview have a great weekend good night

dig yourself lazarus dig yourself lazarus dig yourself lazarus dig yourself back in that hole larry made his nest up in the autumn branches made from nothing but high hopes and thin air he collected up some baby blasted mothers they took their chances and for a while they lived quite happily up there he came from new york city man but he couldn't take the pace he thought it was like a dog eat dog world then he went to san francisco spent a year in outer space with a sweet little san franciscan girl i can hear my mother wailing and a whole lot of scraping of chairs i don't know what it is but there's definitely something going on upstairs lazarus dig yourself lazarus dig yourself lazarus dig yourself i want you to dig meanwhile larry made up names for the ladies like miss boo and miss quick he stockpiled weapons and took potshots in the air he feasted on their bodies like a lunatic and wrapped himself up in their soft yellow hair i can hear chants and incantations and some guy is mentioning me in his prayers well i don't know what it is but there's definitely something going on upstairs lazarus dig yourself lazarus dig yourself lazarus dig yourself back in that hole well to cut a long story short fame finally found him mirrors became his torturers cameras snapped him at every chance the women all went back to their homes and their husbands with secret smiles in the corners of their mouths he ended up like so many of them do back on the streets of new york city in a soup queue a dope fiend a slave then prison then the madhouse then the grave ah poor larry but what do we really know of the dead and who actually cares i don't know what it is but there's definitely something going on upstairs

the wonderful sharleen spiteri we'll be hearing more from sharleen in a moment now i'm about to meet a guest and have a chat at the piano she was in one of the most legendary groups of all time really they had so many hits that i believe everybody in this room and many of you at home will know them let's just see shall we
stop
in the name of love
before
before you break my heart
let's hear more please
baby baby
where did our love go
mm let's hear one more
you can't hurry love no you just have to wait she said love don't come easy
what is it
it's a game of give and take
it certainly is and we welcome mary wilson one time of the supremes
how you doing have a seat
thank you very much it's so fantastic you're here
woo hoo
i've been a fan of yours for a very long time
oh you have how long how long
it's called the supremes mary wilson gown collection and i have all the gowns we wore on top of the pops ready steady go ed sullivan all those kind of things are there
we'll come back to that in a moment but before we go to the gowns which we are going to go to i want to go to the supremes when did the supremes first form
we started singing in nineteen fifty nine we were like thirteen years old we became we had our first hit record in nineteen sixty four in motown records
not one but you had i think twelve number ones in five years
we had five consecutive number ones to start off we used to fight with the beatles all the time they were number one we were number two we were number one they were number two
that was when a number one record was selling millions now a number one record is hundreds of thousands then it was millions
oh darling economically it just doesn't add up they're making far more money than we ever made
did motown organise everything for you
well you know it was kind of a collaboratory thing but they had charm schools for us
charm schools they taught us how to sit with jools
and we were told we'd be singing before kings and queens and we did a command performance in nineteen sixty eight in fact the gown that we wore at the palladium is on exhibit there we met the queen mother she was a doll too
there were three supremes diana ross florence ballard and myself
you all had the same gown identical
in the beginning then it kind of changed and diana would get a different colour in the exhibit there is only one gown they're forty something years old so some of them have not held up
let's have a little look before we go any further we've got a clip of the supremes stopping in the name of love
this time before you run to her leaving me alone and hurt
think it o. over after i've been good to you think it o. over after i've been sweet to you
stop in the name of love before you break my heart stop in the name of love before you break my heart
think it o. over think it o. over
what show was that it's you in the middle i don't know i'm not sure
i used to watch things like that and i wanted to hang out with them
you are it's a dream come true we're sitting together
i'd look at that and think you must be on tour seeing all the world must have been extraordinary it was great was it as great as i imagined it was it was great one of the first places we visited was great britain
in fact baby love was number one here first and we were embraced so well by the english people it was fabulous
now this is on exhibit this is the sort of thing i would love there's you in the middle did you always stand in the middle
until they found out that was the best spot then i was moved out
why was the middle the best spot because that's where i was oh i see
yes indeed we have a lot of memorabilia we have eight tracks these people might be too young to remember eight tracks we have gowns eyelashes wigs all kinds of things on exhibit it's the exhibit that shows you the social relevance of what was going on in the world
and i suppose motown was the first mainstream popular black thing to hit a big white audience
yes it was mr. berry gordy the owner of motown wanted to make music so that everybody could embrace it it was soul music but sometimes it wasn't played by everyone because it was just soul so he sort of made that motown sound so that everyone could enjoy the music

the only way you'll ever learn a thing is to admit that you know absolutely nothing yeah nothing think about this carefully you might not get another chance to speak freely yeah freely
maybe when you're old enough maybe when you're old enough maybe when you're old enough you're not free yeah you're not free
ladies and gentlemen jack white the raconteurs before that bon iver where has he gone he was there a moment marvellous and now i'm going to briefly talk and let's welcome her sharleen spiteri welcome to the show it's very brave you're here i'm just going to do this if i may i've never done this before but i'm in that kind of a mood spring's here you've made your first solo record why have you decided to go solo
um to be scared again um it just felt right everybody else in texas was ally was doing photography and tony and eddie have got a band together so everyone else was doing different projects and it just felt right i wanted to make a kind of fantasy record that i'd always wanted to make that was never really right for texas and it was time to do that to take a chance when you say a fantasy record what sort of style i always wanted to make a record like lee hazlewood and nancy sinatra bobbie gentry kind of stuff there was elements in texas there was the motown stuff and marvin gaye influences throughout our music but for me it was kind of using the brass and the strings and sort of the nancy sinatra thing was really big for me i think
are we ready over there yes it's rather interesting the next group is a fantastic bluegrass group
i heard them doing harmonies amazing
we met on the carolinian heading south from d. c. it's as if god himself had picked out our seats she smiled and said richmond when i asked where she was bound i began to wish my life away to have been born in that town we talked a little bit and then she smiled and i saw then in her eyes she wasn't just beautiful she was kind and she was wise but a woman down in raleigh would soon have my son so i waited for her station like the bullet from a gun she's in richmond with my heart and i'm bound for carolina wish i'd never met this train or the girl it's left behind her when the train reached the station she looked me in the eye said come with me to richmond and we'll start a brand new life well you know that moment still weighs on my mind cos i took my body to raleigh and left my heart behind she's in richmond with my heart and i'm bound for carolina wish i'd never met this train or the girl that's left behind her now we're apart so while i'm bound for carolina she's in richmond with my heart my son is grown up to my hand and he fills me with pride i take him down to the station to watch the trains roll by but that northbound carolinian always makes the teardrops start cos it's headed up to virginia where i left my heart she's in richmond with my heart and i'm bound for carolina wish i'd never met this train or the girl that's left behind her now we're apart so while i'm bound for carolina she's in richmond with my hea a a r. t. i'm still down in carolina she's in richmond with my heart
one microphone multi talent chatham county line have you ever been to chatham in kent no you must visit chatham in kent they love you there now we welcome an extraordinary music legend who has done a record which is a tribute to a great bluesman we welcome mick hucknall
hi jools nice to see you
now um i think the first thing is you've released this record it's the first solo record since simply red yeah and er tell us about who it's a tribute to
it's a tribute to a singer called bobby blue bland who was not very well known um partly because of mary and the supremes in a way because
it's all your fault
they kind of changed the world by bringing sort of motown into pop and bobby was really like an r. and amp b. gospel singer and he kind of was a little bit before them and somehow that whole thing just changed the world and overshadowed that whole scene which is in a way sort of good news for me because so many people are unfamiliar with his work and er the songs that he chose for me have lived with me since i was about nineteen and i think the songs are brilliant so that's one of the reasons why i chose to do this to expose these songs
i remember hearing him doing a record with double b. king and then hearing that record with alone after midnight on it and it made me shake yeah
he used to tour a lot with double b. king i first heard him in liverpool in a club called eric's in about nineteen seventy eight
and did you meet him and talk to him about doing this yeah
i think it's great that you're doing this to shine you know so people can discover bobby blue bland which is a great thing and um will simply red do more after this do you think er
we're going to do one more tour in two thousand nine two thousand ten as a thank you for twenty five years of pleasure and then i want to move on and er just become more try and use my writing now to become more influenced by this period because i think it's really untapped as an influence
we're looking forward to hearing bobby blue bland's song thank you very much mick hucknall now i walk along this well trodden path to introduce this well introduced group glasvegas
the fabulous mick hucknall farther up the road before that glasvegas and now just wait once again the raconteurs i seem to think i think i got a little situation so listen to me sister listen maybe you can help i think i gave a lot of problems my consideration but not for me they always seem to be for someone else why do people always seem to just be on vacation what do i get from them i don't get anything at all i'm like a trash can holding all the information and every single time i'm in the field to be taught woo woo salute your solution now salute your solution
i find myself just looking worthy of my best intentions ignoring any kinda pause i might receive at all all others seem to find a road that's tough to satisfaction i find a ridicule that isn't cool for me at all
and if there's one little answer to this complication someone somewhere help me settle what is on my mind there's only one i'm taking getting and receiving there's only one i'm taking and only one i'm taking and only one i'm taking and only one i'm taking and only one i'm taking and only one
and i got what i got all despite you and i get what i get just to spite you and i got what i got all despite you and i get what i get just to spite you and i got what i got all despite you and i get what i get just to spite you
i find myself just looking worthy of my best intentions ignoring any kinda pause i might receive at all and all the others seem to find myself a satisfaction i find a ridicule that isn't cool for me at all but if there's one little answer to this complication someone somewhere help me settle what is on my mind there's only one i'm only taking getting and receiving there's only one i'm taking and only one i'm taking and only one i'm taking and only one i'm taking and only one
remember when you said we'd run away that you loved me till your dying day and rumours started you're with someone new while i just laughed cos that was all i could do there was me in love i'm on my own ten years if only i had known so you thought you'd come back to me i'm not the same girl that i used to be cos you you want the world from me i can't go back back to just you and me cos i could never lie something inside just died it was you how does it feel to be so untrue and there's nothing even you can do all those years of lying to yourself i think you'll find that you're back on the shelf now so i hid behind my smile less than that just for a while then one day i walked away i know you never loved me anyway cos you you want the world from me i can't go back back to just you and me cos i could never lie something inside just died it was you hey don't come running back to me don't come running back to me don't come running back to me don't come running back to me cos you you want the world from me i can't go back back to just you and me cos i could never lie it was you you want the world from me cos i could never lie something inside just di i. ied it was you
it was you sharleen spiteri she's relaxing with a cup of tea there so thank you to all of our marvellous guests thank you the raconteurs thank you chatham county line thank you to the fabulous mick hucknall three cheers for bobby blue bland thank you mary wilson she's in the victoria and albert museum thank you glasvegas thank you bon iver next week the fabulous paul weller martha wainwright tricky and lots more that'll be next tuesday but now we finish with nick cave and the bad seeds
to rely on i have no place to go it is hard i hope the government will do something about this and help us
taking care of her and the remaining survivors is now what matters well let's speak to our correspondent he is in one of the cities centre of the devastation we're seeing some of those harrowing images of those people brought out of some of the rubble still alive after what six days now those searches carrying on are they
they have power they have purchasing power they have power in terms what they buy and how it's packed the problem is in a sense by focusing on the consumer end they are to some extent diverting attention from what they should be doing customers see plastic bags as an issue but in reality they're a small proportion of the waste they're a small proportion of oil they use and therefore in overall resource terms it is a visual thing
less than two per cent what goes into landfill is made up of packaging and a tiny fraction is made up plas it can bags the government admits taxing plastic bags is unlikely to have a significant impact on volumes of waste but it says that's not the point
we know the public is on our side they want action it is important to take that action it may be a small part of the waste but it is symbolic of our thro away society so we need to do something quite dramatically to curb their use
up and yet gordon brown has made an upfront criticism of the regime there seems no indication they are prepared to change their stance on
people to release these men who have been away from their families for over one year you know what that means therefore i appeal to you as good people to release these men who long to be back home once more
zimbabwe's opposition leader advantage ang advantage morgan tsvangirai is to return to the country to continue the voting the queen's eldest grandchild will get married today in windsor peter philips the son of princess anne will wed miss kelly she's given up her faith to retain her fiance's place as eleventh in line to the throne cardiff and port myth will meet in the final of what is the most unpredictable f. a. cup in living memory the stakes are high both clubs will take the trophy for the second time portsmouth has been waiting for seventy years for cardiff's plans the long wait is nearly over it is some eighty one years since their last f. a. cup final while her the underdogs both players and supporters can hardly wait
we want the cup again my mum saw it when she was six so it is my turn to see it
we want the rugby we want them both
bring it back to wales
good luck cardiff
lifting the cup on saturday
there's even traditional cup final songs take your pick between cardiff's blue bird's flying home high and portsmouth to their talismanic manager hurry up harry harry's side are surprised finalists portsmouth triumph was in nineteen thirty nine so another success is long overdue
to actually to be going to wembley lead ago team out in the cup final is fantastic and the pompey people going back for a final will be a great day
you can pay for a product and a month or two before you take it up you're asked to pay more we think the industry should put their house in order and stop passing
over the years the pound has been incredibly strong therefore we and i'm sure others have done incredibly eight now the pound is heading in the other way i'm not sure it is right to turn to the customers to bail us out
some are suggesting that the
to do it it is costly to collect and also you're losing customers because they may not come back the next year it is not something that tour operators want to do they would rather not deal with it but they have this expense
if you are in that situation and the tour company says we need another eighty and you say actually i can't pay that what happens do
and will you lose the whole lot
and some companies do it and some don't how is it that some are able to and some are able to swallow the extra costs
a lot of the bigger companies are able to hedge and play the currency markets and they are just bigger and able to absorb some of the losts and some of the smaller companies just can't do that so they are put in a position they might go to the wall until they impose the surcharges
what advice do you give to potential holiday makers is there a logic in leaving things until later so you know what you're going to pay
tour operators cannot impose a sur channelling within thirty days of departure so i suppose if you leave it to the last minute you're less likely to get a surcharge but booking early means you get more flexible options and
the people
it started as a crack in the road and now it is big news
usually we've seen them on t. v. coming out of florida so this is a first for us
open the door and cut through the seals and across the floor and the roof ten minutes work
he's chilly by name and nature but
you know i love you take fast sad day and make it better
one to rely on i have no place to go it is very hard l. hope the government can help us
because god is compassionate may i appeal to you as honourable people to release these men who have been away from their families for over one year you know what that means and therefore i appeal to you as good people to release these men who long to be back home once more
background as normal those who know her believe she'll cope well as a member of the royal family
she's not only intelligent and very pretty but she's also one of the wois she can stand her ground
cup final cardiff take on ports myth at wembley this afternoon for the first time since nineteen ninety five team outside the big four of manchester united arsenal and liverpool will lift the cup we've seen shocks in this cup and cardiff could spring a surprise but portsmouth assistant manager sees this as a chancetor pompey to make history
it is not an arsenal or man united and that should inspire them more for me it is limited opportunities to win the f. a. cup i got lucky i was with a massive club a few times and got a few more opportunities than most but that should inspire these players that it may not come along again nineteen thirty nine the last time let's grab it and win it
it is an amazing feeling and yeah it's great we have this opportunity and to go with a club like cardiff to a f. a. cup final and not going will just to make up the numbers just going to battle and to give a go and hopefully bring the cup back
we'll be live at wembley in an hour and throughout the day coverage of the f. a. cup final starts at one hundred forty on b. b. c. one and interactive and the b. b. c. sports website if you press the red button you can hear it in welsh or from the b. b. c. south team the division one playoff final will be an all yorkshire affair after doncaster rovers beat them at five to one there was hat trick for goals before and after half team he left the best to last with superbly free kick leeds will now take a trip to wembley rangers may have lost one cup final but they have one to look forward to this season before the showpiece game against queen of south rangers have three s. p. l. games to fit in they play at motherwell and again on monday and thursday the chance of the quad droupel is gone but the treble is still on
everybody here faces a big test to get themselves lifted and get through what's an unusual circumstance for any team to be playing three league games in such a short space of time with importance placed on them plus all away from home it is a difficult task and one that i don't think many teams are asked to do
it is
good for english football it is the fact it is the best football
league in the world i believe and if one has the potential to participate one should do l. have been following it since the beginning and i love t.
you can understand the fans includes like yours get worried say someone rich from outside we don't know will they pull out at some point
statistically every single football club that is in the hands of a foreign owner has done the same or progressed since they became owner let's judge people by actions or not fears or rumours
and in general we have the best manager in england
now they reached the cup final how quickly can they break in
we can next year if he gives me two hundred million i can do it no problem
harry always laughing wonderful negotiations going on there i will just give me my fee there i wonder what is it like when they sit down and do the figures asen outsider looking in there's a kind of feeling about it this year
for the first time the top four are not involved for a long time the romance is back the glory that how much it means it is not koomptigs that's consaiting for a poor season it is a chance for clubs to make history
back in nineteen twenty seven the overwhelm time cardiff won it he will be at the game today three years shy of his century
you're watching breakfast from b. b. c. news the headlines for the first time china is allowing foreign rescue workers into the country to help in the search for survivors of monday's earthquake cutting down on plastic bags but now supermarkets are accused of diverting attention away from more serious environmental issues and still to come how to get the latest software and technology for your computer without having to pay for it before that the weather thank you very much it's perhaps good for the gardens but not so great if you have an f. a. cup final to watch or the cricket yes there will be some rain around today there is lain across the central belt of scotland and quite wet too for the north of wales and the south west of wales and in the south west of england there are some lively onpours just pushing into devon at present so it will be a damp start for many of us and for the vast majority a rather grey and cloudy one a little brightness for a time across northern scotland and northern ireland and while there will be some cloud across the north of england it will ease off later in the day for all of us a cooler day with temperatures well down on
this time last weekend tomorrow
alternative windows is significant part of the cost of
where free software has managed to innovate what has happened for a long time is that microsoft has been so dominant in the commercial browser market there has not been any room for alternatives so it has been left to enthusiasts and the open source community to take areas where they think browsers could be improved and put that into their own products so if we're looking at things like tabbed browsing and pop up blocking and autocompleting of forms these are innovations we saw first of all in free software but then picked up specifically by microsoft and the wider community
many many more products that pretend to be free anti virus or spy wear protectors and what they're doing is they're either installing it themselves or just detecting it and then asking you to pay for something to remove it and that's not very helpful and is just cynical if you're trying to run your machine for free
now the best value free ware we can find open office is an alterish to microsoft it is a fairly hefty download but it gives you a spread sheet data wear and presentation programmes and all can read and save in microsoft's office suite all alan is editor of a computer magazine and he's a seasoned editor of free software why do people dedicate their time to writing software and then give it away free
i think it is partly because of the kudos they like to see something they've spent a lot of time on outclassing something from say microsoft and they like the comments from the users as well
but we also see big companies releasing feely featuring software what is the thing will they sell me things or put adverts on one that a way they make money
there is some data they will try to update or include and other companies will add spy wear in the download so the best advice is if you are going to choose to take free downloads go to a reputable site and when you get there if there is a terms and conditions section have a quick read through it and make sure you're not ticking boxes which says the kpls can sell on
minister making very clear in his b. b. c. interview repeating the phrase again and again that a natural disaster is turning into a man made catastrophe he is seeking to ramp up the pressure on the burmese government he says the international community needs to work together and to keep this pressure up it needs to be concerted pressure because the best way to help people is to persuade the generals to accept more aid he doesn't rule out with aid drops but the most effective way to do this is going to be persuading the burmese
thank you very much for that the government's policy on plastic bags is allowing supermarkets to pass the buck for cutting waste on to shoppers that's according to one of the government's own advisers professor chris coggins says the focus on carrier bags is diverting the attention on to far more pressing environmental problems and confusing customers if you're doing a supermarket shop this weekend you may notice a difference at the tills single used plastic bags are in short supply with marks and amp spencers charging and other retailers using incentives to get us to reduce the twelve point five billion we use every year why so much attention on the bag gun government advisers thinks the government's overreacting to a relatively insignificant problem and supermarkets are passing the buck to customers
they have purchasing power they have power in terms what they buy and how it is packed the problem is in a sense by focusing on the consumer end they are to some extent diverting attention what they should be doing public see plastic bags as an issue but they are a small proportion of the waste they're a small proportion of oil they use so in overall resource terms it is a visual thing rather
there are a lot of very important provisions within the climate change bill that we do support we think this is a rather trivial issue to add on to it it's not just a sledgehammer it is use ago steam roller to crack a wall nut it isn't the best use of our resourceness terms of all the issues we need to be addressing
this waste here is destined for landfill sites but less than two per cent of what goes noon landfill is made up of packaging and tiny fraction is made up of plastic bags the government admits that taxing
plastic bags is unlikely to have
important to take that action it may be a small part of the waste stream buts symbolic of our throw away society we need to do something dramatically to curb their use
my mum saw it when she was six so
bring it back to wales eighty one years we've been waiting
good luck cardiff
your pick between cardiff's blue birds flying high and portsmouth to theirallies manic manager hurry up harry harry redknapp's side is surprised finalists portsmouth cup triumph was in nineteen thirty nine so another success is long overdue
to actually to be going to wembley now leading a team out in the cup final is fantastic pompey fans to be go there to go to the semis and now time it will be a great day
incredibly pou powerful there's a huge environmental impact of the goods they buy in the packaging on the things they buy and where they put their supermarkets for example if they're on the big out of site that has a huge impact on the environment although packaging and bags are worth sorting out we shouldn't congratulate the supermarket and say well done it's a tiny part of it
the consumers attention is diverted from this issue that looking like you're doing something about plastic bags looks like you are doing something big for the environment
we heard the minister saying this was symbolic it is sim boggic in that we all know what we're talking about but if you think about the whole environment the government are talking a tax on plastic bags but meanwhile we're getting coal fired power stations and airport expansions these will have a huge impact on the environment so against that backdrop they're tiny
plas stack bags make up a tiny proportion what goes into landfill and actually some customers feel guilty about them at the same time the supermarkets themselves are encasing so many of the products in plastic packagiling do you think the supermarkets are let off the hook in terms of packaging and guilt transferred to the customers
how does the government get the supermarkets to do that without it is interfering
the headlines for the first time china is allowing foreign rescue workers into the country to help in the search for survivors of monday's earthquake cutting down on plastic bags but now supermarkets are accused of diverting attention away from more serious environmental issues and still to come holiday price hike where some travel companies are asking for more money that customers thought they had already paid for and it is legal but it's not really holiday weather this weekend is it let's see what the weather has in store yes good morning it is a grey start to saturday and there will be damp weather around too not everywhere will see that but there are very few places i can guarantee will stay dry today except the north west of scotland but there will be rain in central and southern scotland and livier downpours will develop in england especially in the south east and south west and not just this morning all the way into the afternoon heavy thunderstorms and even hail possible out there and it will feel cool in a brisk north easterly wind in wales some brightness here and there but hit and miss showers and generally cloudy and cloud over northern ireland and that could produce one or too showers and it will be cool at fourteen celsius in scotland things should be largely dry this afternoon cloudy in the west the north and the east britening up and temperatures around nine or ten celsius a bit more brightness in the north east of england but the further west and south we come the more rain there will be which could be heavy at times there shouldn't be too much disruption for the players this afternoon at wembley and there will be interruptions throughout the day at lords through the night the skies clear but under the clearing skies temperatures will take a dip and will become low enough over parts of north of england for some grass frost and in scotland there could be an air frost and the reason for that is because the winds are drag in from the north and that will continue into sunday there will still be some showers lurking around in the channel so particularly for the channel islands and the south west and on sunday it will be five fresh start and cloudy but later on not bad day bright and bright for most of us but temperatures just twelve to sixteen degrees a good ten to fourteen degrees lower than this time last week so a cloudy day for most of us today drier and brighter tomorrow for the first time in twenty years thousands of holiday makers are being asked to stump up more to pay for their holiday the travel operators say it is because of the rising costs of fuel and the different exchange rates summer holidays they're all about sun sand and sea but this year there is something else surcharges some holiday companies are forcing their customers to pay more for their summer break they blame it on the strength of the euro so far twenty three holiday firms are asking for extra and abta says several thousand holiday makers are being affected at time when many families are facing rising costs elsewhere it is a move that is not going down well
the travel industry is the only one in which you can pay for a product you pay for it months in advance and then a month before you're due to avail yourself of that product or service you're asked to pay even more and we think that the travel industry really should put their house in order and stop passing surcharges on to consumers
of funerals now starting to happen and people giving up hope so let's just hope that the international community and china itself keeps up the pressure over who can be found to be saved
and a political story closer to home this is in the times and there will be more openness about second home expenses
not if m. p.'s have anything to do with it parliament has been attempting to block any disclosure of m. p.s' expenses in accordance with second homes and they've failed this is very exciting because next friday we might finally have won the right to know what gordon brown's expenses are what george osborne's expenses and how much they are getting paid to run the second homes why is this important because we're supposed to be living in a democracy they're supposed to be working for us and it is taxpayers' money and i think this whole affair of trying to block it
has been very very shoddy it's
real low point in public life don't you think snoop
well t. is a mixed thing some of the m. p.'s whose details are due to be released have been fairly straightforward and saying they don't have a problem who is it who doesn't want their details out
the argument they put forward was about security they said wu have to include these addresses you would have to include these addresses in order for them to be fully open and the judges dismissed the attempt as wholly unreasonable on the grounds that if you go to a local library everyone's addresses can be found heads of corpations their addresses are public if you are in the business of public services you have to be accountable so good net friday we have something to look forward to
those working class roots and it says that cherie blair came from a gent yeel house where people had bum prams and walked along the prom not quite accurate and in fact very inaccurate for cherie herself it is a nice area a poor area the opening of the book concentrates on crosby but if you have people from six generations in a tiny house it
yes i'm cherie blair's half sister
it is interesting to hear your side of the story thank you very much also coming up in the programme
she is one of the boys she can stand her ground
people to release these men who have been away from their family for over one year you know what that means l. appeal to you as good people to release these men who long to be back home once more

didn't make a difference have you kept anything from your fiance and revealed it before you got married get in touch with us if you have anything to die vulidge db divulge well maybe something in the past ruined people's lives we county the b. b. c. breakfast confessional i love it what is happening it is a big day today f. a. cup final day every fan looks forward to not one people would have expected but estimated five hundred million people will tune in around the world to watch this afternoon's f. a. coup final cardiff of the championship take on premier league ports myth at wembley for the first time since nineteen ninety five a team outside the big four will lift the cup let's speak to our reporter andy swiss who is at wembley good morning not the final that people would have been expecting it is fair to say
that's right yes i suspect if someone had told you at the start of the season that cardiff would be playing portsmouth in the f. a. cup final would you have laughed in their faces neither side with any f. a. cup pedigree cardiff haven't reached the final since nineteen twenty seven portsmouth won it in nineteen thirty nine and it is the first time for a number of years we haven't seen one of the big four in the final a lot of people were calling it predictable and steal this year's tournament has been anything but we've had so many shocks and this is certainly fitting finale
f. a. cup brings wonderful individual stories history beckons for a seventeen year old young welshman
that's right look out for the name aaaron ramsay this time last year he was taking his gcses he could become the youngest winner he is an attacking midfielder highly sought after and valued at around ten million so watch out for him cardiff manage today blend youthful players like ramsay alongside a few old stages like hasselbaink who achieved success with leeds and chelsea trevor sinclair a former england player and look out for roby fowler he's been injured for most the season and hasn't played this year after serious hip surgery but he could yet be on the bench for cardiff he's just the sort of player you wouldn't want to see if you're the opposition coming on the final ten minutes because fowler is a natural goal scorer that would be some story if he could score
thank you very much we will be live at wembley in an hour and throughout the day and coverage of the f. a. cup final starts at one thousand two hundred forty p. m. on b. b. c. one and interactive press the red button you can hear the match commentary in welsh or b. b. c. south team the division one playoff final will be a all yorkshire affair after doncaster rovers beat five to one man of the match was james coppingcher he left the best until last doncaster are face leeds their first trip to the stadium rangers may have lost one cup final this week but they have bun to look forward to but before that showpiece game next saturday rangers have lee s. p. l. games to fit in they play today at motherwell and on monday and thursday the chance of the quadruple is gone but the treble is still on
day three of the opening test as they want to build a first innings lead at lords so far the match has been interrupted by bad light and rain snoo it really should have been the england batsmen coming out foirs thing they let the new zealand off the hook the key was not to let them get away again sidebottom caught behind he built a stubborn partner h. p. and there was resistance with sweeping shots sidebottom was in the mood and mills was next up in the firing line sidebottom did for him too though new zealand's two hundred seventy seven respectable considering the start they made on the first day playing cricket in england in is a periless business bad light regularly stopped play spectators forced to find other things to occupy their time bird watching perhaps or perhaps a spot of water colours
night leaders leeds beat wakefield by fifty eight to one it two while wigan came from behind warrington led fourteen to eight but suffered a second half blitz were wigan noble ran in five tries to move above warrington into a layers spot now mike's not in the studio this week but he has been the first t. v. and radio interview with the manager of portsmouth he gave an exclusive interview in the naval dockyard he wants the city's heritage to be part of the future in portsmouth's historic dockyard the future of the club looks secure this is one foreign investors who insists he is here for the long term and believes it is good for english football
the fact it is the best football league in the world
i believe i have been living in england for one years now i have been following it from the beginning i love it you can understand the fans clubs who get worried someone from outside we don't know a lot of money will
mean for portsmouth to win for this in terms for your future ambition
for a club like ours and in general we have the best manager in laenged
now they've reached the cup time how quickly can they move forward break into the top four
yes if he gives me two hundred million i can do it no problem
if i can put portsmouth shirt on hen ry eighth they can do anything he didn't answer the question

london is a british city the british currency is united kingdom pounds or sterling
an international audience but the british audience say they've funded it with their licence fee
it is hard to get the balance right at times first of all on the funding point the overnight service is largely funded by the licence fee but a substantial amount is funded from b. b. c. world news which is separately funded and commercially funded so they have a stake in what is happening and that is why we have it overnight because the viewing figures are generally much lower as for the balance i thinking looking back we did get it wrong l. looked back over the british earthquake and i think we didn't get it right and there are suggestions that it shouldn't happen again
two stories on this channel a story about striking lorry grivers in greece and perhaps greece lorry drivers in greece and perhaps even stranger a piece
thank you very much last week senior executives were given a hard time in glasgow by viewers given what they see as an anglo centred agenda our post bag suggests this is a big issue with viewers with instances like this
pupils up and down the country are being forced to take the day off because of national strike up and down the country
viewer to the studio so a member of the audience was asked to stand in and this was a mistake
the b. b. c. has been forced to unveil various deceptions usually rigging phone calls one or two heads rolled and there has been an unprecedented call for re training
when i sit in my sitting room i expect the people making the programmes to be honest with me l. don't mind editing short cuts but i object to being told that something is true when it isn't and this programme is about drawing the lines
the focus for journalists and producers has been less on outright deception and more on grey areas at this point we had hoped to show you a clip of top gear one of the programmes which crop ed up during discussions the issue was whether during a race to the north pole the b. b. c.'s jeremy clarks on was really at the wheel all the time clarkson and this programme about climbing the andes it was not possible to get a helicopter view of the top so these views are about a whole different group lct so it is about using acceptable production techniques or does it matter at all the b. b. c. hopes that everyone now knows where the line in the sand is drawn you run the b. b. c.'s course on journalism and a lot of people said we've done nothing wrong
and how much does the audience care about this
with did a lot of audience surveys and a range of issues came out first of all the audiences trust the b. b. c. by five long mile ahead but the expectations of the b. b. c. are much much higher than any other broadcaster and as for the techniques their approach is probably a lot more liberal than we take ourselves but one thing that became very clear was although they don't want broadcasters to deceive them in any way at all but nor do they want the programme spoilt by endless disclaimers like this was recorded an hour and a half ago so the question i had was when there is an element of artefice how do you label it
and how do you
estimates we have seen from organisations like the red cross but the fact the burmese government basically doubled their estimate of the number of dead and mising in a twenty four hour period tells you i think how difficult to the get an accurate picture on the ground if they themselves can't get an accurate picture that they need to boost their estimates just so hugely over such a short period you can just imagine how difficult the situation is and the particular problem with that is unless you can get an accurate picture it is differ to plan well to find how to help the survivors of this storm
gordon brown accusing the burmese regime of inhumane treatment how many ever how much of an impact would a commend like that from the british prime minister have on the burmese junta comment
bags is allowing supermarkets to pass the buck for cutting waste on to shoppers that's according to one of the government's own advisers professor chris coggins says the focus on carrier bags is diverting attention from far more pressing environmental problems and is confusing customers breakfast's keith doyle has this report if you are doing a supermarket shop this weekend you may notice a difference at the tills single use plastic bags are in shorter fly with marks and amp spencer charging and other retailers using various incentives to gets us to reduce the one hundred twenty five billion we use every year but why so much attention on the plastic bag one government adviser says they are overreacting and supermarkets are passing the buck to commerce
they have purchasing power power in terms of what they buy and how it is packed the problem is in a sense by focusing on the consumer end they are to some extent diverting attention from what they should be doing the public see plastic bags as an issue but in reality they are a spre small proportion of the waste a very small proportion of the oil that they use therefore in overall resource terms it is a visual thing rather than a main stream issue
the government's put pressure on retailers and supermarkets giving them an ultimatum to reduce plastic bag use by quarter or face taxes it is making provision for bag tax in the climate change bill going through parliament now retailers say focusing on bags is wasting their time
there are a lot of very important provisions within the climate change bill we do support we think this is a rather trivial issue to add on to it it is not just a sledgehammer it is using a stream steamroll tore crack a walnut
this waste is destined for landfill but less than two per cent of what goes into landfill is made up of packaging and only al tiny fraction of that is plastic bags the government admits taxing plastic bags is unlikely to have significant impacts on vols of waste but says that isn't the point
we know the public is on our side they want action and it is important to take that afpblgts it may be a small part of the waste stream but it is symbolic of our throwaway society we do need to do
that's rights good morning it is all fairly quiet here at wembley at the moment but in a few hours' time this place will be bustling with more than eighty thousand fans what a final be one that no one had predicted as portsmouth take on cardiff for cardiff's fan it's long wait is nearly over it is some eighty one years since their last f. a. cup final and while they might be the underdogs both players and supporters can hardly wait
good luck we want the cup again my mum saw it win she
bring it back to wales eighty one years we have been waiting
there's been the traditional cup final songs cardiff's bluebirds flying high and portsmouth's ode to their talismanic manager hurry up harry harry redknapp's side are surprise finalists ports moith's only f. a. cup triumph was in nineteen thirty nine so another success is long overdue
to be going to wembley now leading the team out in the cup final is fantastic for pompey fans to be going there to go to the semis and now the final it's going be a great day
not at all we absolutely agree that this isn't the most important environmental issue the only reason we would be responding on plastic bags is that our customers tell us they are concerned about it that's why we are giving away ten million re usable bags next week one for every one of our customers but there are bigger issues and we are working on the bigger issues
we've had lot of comment from people they were irritated that they as customers are asked by you and other stouments get used to not using so many plastic bags and you still continue packaging so much stuff in so much plastic and effectively as shopper in this their normal shop they are having trouble avoiding it why don't you deal with that
we have reduced our packaging by eight thousand tonnes in the last couple of years that's the equivalent of seventeen million sandwich boxes each day we have made a huge effort but you have to remember about packaging that it protects food and makes it last longer as you know last week wrap produced a report which said we are throwing away thirty per cent of our food if we didn't package our food we would be throwing away even more we are reducing our carbon footprint by one hundred fifteen thousand tonnes that's the equivalent of flying to and fro from new york ninety time as day every day we have really made big surprise to help reduce waste and in carbon
some of the statistics sound impressive the starting point you come from is pretty poor though isn't it you talk about the reduction in packaging but that came from dreadful start in point on the supermarket shelves there is still an awful lot of stuff pre packaged in what appears to be useless plastic
even if you are only asked to pay a surcharge of a few per cent extra it can make a real dent in your holiday money that could mean you have to cut back on your spending plans when you get there thank you but some small tour operators believe there is no reason to make customers pay a surcharge in the first place over the last four years the pound has been incredibly strong
they are still do so in time for summer especially if the pan starts to fall again against the euro we were talking a bit more about that we will be getting a opinion on that for mytravel journalist by its have a look at the papers hello again first that have a better headlines the front page of the times the there we have run at this morning asking for the british hostages to be released the picture is harrison ford in cannes head of his movie indiana jones all of the talk as if he can carry it off at sixty five the daily mail that morning says that n. h. s. doctors are refusing to carry out late abortions it means that three quarters of the seven thousand terminations performed after seventeen weeks' pregnancy are being carried out outside the national health service you probably saw these in edges yesterday this is make regan the police officer who fell to the ground and was attacked after that uefa cup final in manchester he was talking about his ordeal the daily express says there is new hope for an end to the economic slump it says after weeks of gloom the finally finely the markets began to rally they asked for reports this morning of people being pulled out of the rubble in china some of the devastation the independent featuring one of those pictures you can see her factory worker being brought out having spent one hundred hours under the rubble lauren good morning l. know you are still making notes l. think this confuses a lot of people a number of big companies reporting boosted profits and yet we all seem to be paying more l. suppose
this thought process does occur to a lot of people but what do you do especially at the supermarket people have to buy stuff somewhere
the office of fair trading is taking a look at this very seriously and has raided the offices of tesco asda morrisons and sainsbury's last month that investigation about price fixing stop the price fixing and cut your profits at it
let's talk about the holidays
it do you think these discrepancies have got worse l. am trying to think back l. wonder if twenty years ago people faced the same problem and it is just that we go away more
i think and eighty per cent change
this is interesting because it is by the writer ian jack it is a good saturday piece he has just come back from the first palestine festival of literature paddy doyle was there and he has been amazed by the situation in palestine in hebron he says that during the first visit there are one hundred sixty thousand palestinians living there because of the presence of five hundred settlers the place is now a ghost town three quarters of the shops have closed the market no longer opens four thousand israeli soldiers patrolled the streets i think what is good about a. r. article like this is that it is a first person experience of a situation that the rest of us you can't quite taste it until you get there a wonderful piece l. recommend it

celina is here with important news in the world of football f. a. cup final day the portsmouth manager harry redknapp has forbidden any of his players to touch the f. a. cup in the build up to the game hen he was manager at born moulth he wore the same tie suit and trousers for twenty matches they were washed in between five point five million people will tune in around the world to watch cardiff take on portsmouth at wembley for the first time since nineteen eighty five a team outside big four will lift the cup andy swiss is at wembley good morning it should be an intriguing cup final here at wembley this afternoon let's chat with b. b. c. radio's very own f. a. cup specialist mark clemmit you've been following the f. a. cup from the very earliest round it has been an extraordinary tournament hasn't it
final they have this blend of youth and experience don't they
they've kind of snuck under the radar they came to prominence in the quarterfinal it's everyone is talking about aaron ramsey everyone is looking at him the big clubs a great performance at middlesbrough a great goal from ledley to get him into the final now can can they be the first second flight club to win it since west ham back in nineteen eighty maybe trevor brook willing stop talking about that goal
portsmouth how do you say assess their qualities and that of harry redknapp red
at the end of the day is problem is where are the goals going to come from benjani has gone to manchester city
but for harry redknapp he's never been to wembley to win here will mean so much wouldn't it
who is going to win
i make the prediction that it will be two to one cardiff have it from wembley for
everybody here faces big tests footballing wise to get themselves lifted and get through what's an unusual circumstances for any team to be playing three league game in this such a short time with the importance that's placed on them plus all the way from home it is a difficult task one that i don't think many teams are asked to do
believe and if one has the opportunity to participate one should do i've been living in england for over thirteen years now the i've been following it since the beginning i just love it
a foreign owner has progressed let's judge people by their actions not by fierce or rumours that people might entertain
to get to a cup final what does that mean form portsmouth to win in terms of your future ambition
it is crucial because football clubs are built on
future ambition it is crucial because football clubs are built on
history and the amount of silverware they have in their boardroom it is a unique taunt cups are the places we can perform
he persuaded harry redknapp to stay earlier this season
we have the best manager for a club like ours we have the best manager in england
how quickly can the club move forward forward will you break into the top four
owner of a premier league club in the last few minutes we have heard that an entire town in sichuan province has been evacuated after a nearby river burst its bank a b. b. c. reporter caught up in the disaster says thousands are fleeing the town paul danahar is in beichuan in the province of
there was report that a lake had burst its banks l. heard about twenty minutes before the rumour spread and the chaos began l. covered the tsunami and it was not uncommon for the merest rumour of another disaster coming this way to spread panic the problem is you have an entire community that's been shaken to their very core they are on the alan johnson they are skittish there are buildings trod topple over the mere thought of something like that coming their way has just sewn seeds of despair this town is now pretty much a ghost town apart from the few of the army and rescue workers standing around me that i think have the message that this is a rumour even know the river may have burst its bank there is not water coming this way
all of this time he is buried under a thick layer of concrete and the rescuers left him it makes complete sense because if there had been a wave coming he would not have survived they need the people with this expertise to save people evacuating the town was the only sensible thing to do i'd find i think we'll find that within the next minutes and hours people will come back down again this is an entire community that has been traumatised and you can understand them acting in this way
from the money box programme
have to admit it
is confusing it it is all numbers and it is difficult i'm sorry i didn't do it
we are not holding new responsible perhaps you can explain the chancellor has chosen a specific way to compensate people
meanwhile this whole plan is costing almost three billion but the cost of it is more than it would cost to compensate everyone who lost out
if you could have picked out all of those people who lost and just gave them what they lost it would have cost a lot less
it was much more complicated finding those people and getting the money to them personally it would have cost a fortune in administration the chancellor now says he has another reason for giving away two point seven billion that is to give everybody a bit of a tax boost the economy is in the doldrums in america they gave everybody money to go and spend and boost the economy most people who did not lose anything that going to get another one hundred twenty in their pay packets from september spread until next year it gives everyone a bit of a boost and it will help boost the economy that is his reasoning or his excuse l. think it was just because it was too complicated and expensive to target this health held on the people who needed it you have to have a general change
brought up in a suburb of montreal autumn kelly has described her background as normal those who know her believe she will cope well as a member of the royal family
she is not only intelligent and very pretty she is also one of the boys she will stand her ground
i have
ahead and be in the pictures l. think it would be quite remarkably she was but buckingham palace have not said either way l. guess they will have to go and look at hello
i wouldn't say i have kept secrets l. think girls quite a lot did this thing that they just maybe try to be a little bit of what they think the boy friend might like when they first go out with him when i did lots of research for my book i got some really funny stories of girls who found out things like their boyfriend was an avid runner so they showed a real interest and ended up doing marathons and things they never would have done that normally one friend her boyfriend was into skydiving because she wanted to seem like she was up for that kind of thing she found herself agreeing to throw herself out of a plane
that she would have met friends of his and it would have come up at some stage he said he didn't feel any need to tell her retort six weeks down the line she was sat at home in canada watching television watching a documentary about prince william's twenty first birthday and there was peter she was like that guy looks a bit like peter she realised it was her boyfriend she went on the internet and found him she was actually quite upset l. think she realised this was quite a big thing him being part of the royal family she was worried about how that could complicate the relationship she was a bit angry with him
people have been in touch with us this morning saying peter said that one day he found out that his girlfriend was a russian countess from pre revolution days therefore unfortunately she was broke and still broke twenty years on but still together you might worry that if you tell people you have some sort of history there might change their view of you
in some ways in a way i think it is quite sweet that she didn't know it meant that their relationship could develop quite normally it is such an overbearing thing of course she would have been interested to know all about the royals perhaps he didn't like talking about it perhaps he wanted to be taken at face value for the person that he was it is quite sweet that she didn't know
he is a relatively
low profile role not now
a few minutes ago there was complete panic and chaos in this town everyone start to do run thousands of people were stampeding their way through the main thoroughfare here trying to get away from what they believed was a huge wave of water after reports that a local river had burst its bank and the water was coming this way the place went from a scene of rescue and relief into mayhem everyone ran the army the aid workers the survivors the people who tried to come back to collect their possessions everyone evacuated the city the people in the process of being rescued were left behind we have walked back down again because we were told by central control that it was a rumour that the water was coming this way and the town is deserted apart from a handful of aid work erst it's a terrible thing to happen to this town because this late into the earthquake time is crucial and minutes and hours can mean people's lives and this operation may be suspended for some time
what was it that made people think this was about to happen what made people think this water was coming down the mountainside
yes he was very clear the message he was trying to send he said was this natural disaster risks being made into a man made catastrophe because of the intransigence of the generals because they are refusing to accept the aid that international organisations are offering l. would think inside burma they will shrug this off as they have done in the past what the prime minister is saying is there needs to be concerted pressure not just from britain but from the rest of the european union the rest of the international community and from burma's neighbours and most of all from the countries that burma really listens to china which in the past have had the most
first of all on the amount assess of aid that's getting in the answer is much more than there was a week ago but but not enough the international red cross for instance has told me they have seventeen flights in this week of which they manage to do get some cargo on to they say that's encouraging but when you look at the amount of food aid that's required it is just a several hundred tonnes that have gone in and they need several hundreds of thousands of tonnes of food aid so they are a long way short of what they think they might need in terms of an accurate picture of how many people are in need on the ground again very difficult to say we know that hundreds of thousands of people are at risk tens of thousands of people are missing l. heard from an international organisation in rangoon save the children they believe that the international aid agencys that are working there many of them with locally hired staff have manage to do reach four hundred thousand people in the irrawaddy delta a considerable achievement bearing in mind the restrictions there are not allowing staff for example to work in the delta and having to rely on locals that's an achievement but they would admit there's a lot more that they need to do
chris thank you i want to bring you some information from china this morning one piece of specific information about the death toll in one town it is twenty thousand after the earthquake in daiyang paul take us through what's happened there
i'm standing in an listen desolate beichuan just half an hour ago it was buzzing with aid workers military guys and military teams trying to rescue people then a rumour swept this city that water was on its way from a river that burst its banks and there was panic thousands of people ran for higher ground the relief aid had to be suspended the people in the workers' point of view you want to make sure you can keep them alive as if there had been another disaster you would have needed them to look after the next wave of casualties everyone had to leefrplt we have come back down again with the first teams that were coming in but from's just a couple of dozen of them the rest
to be honest with you to cause a major disaster you need a very quick massive gush of water and water levels rising you can measure
and therefore you can take
against it but the dams were obviously causing people a great deal of concern but moef those have been checked and where repairs were needed they have taken place i think the chinese are confident that they've sorted that problem out the reaction of the chinese government here has been overwhelming with they have thrown everything at this disaster they simply aren't taking any chances they can't be faulted for the aid operation they've been run something far
paul for the moment thank you for your time there were fears that a river that burst its banks had caused water to run down the valley the government's policy on plastic bags is allowing supermarkets to pass the buck for cutting waste on to shoppers that's according to one of the government's own advisers professor chris coggins says the focus on carrier bags is diverting attention from far more pressing environmental problems and is confusing customers breakfast's keith doyle has this report if you are doing a supermarket shop this weekend you may notice a difference at the tills single use plastic bags are in shorter fly with marks and amp spencer charging and other retailingers using various inventsives to get us to reduce the twelve point five billion we use every year but why so much attention on the plastic bag one government adviser think it's government is overreacting and supermarkets are
there are a lot of very important provisions within the climate change bill that we do support we think this is a rather trivial issue to add on to it it is not just a sledgehammer it is using a steamroll tore crack a walnut it is not the best uses of resources in terms of all the issues we need to be addressing
this waste is destined for landfill sites but less than two per cent of what goes into landfill is packaging and only a facts and figures of that is made up of plastic bags the government admits taxing plastic bag s. s. unlikely to have significant impact on waste but says that is not the point
we know the public is on our side they want action and it is very important to take that a it may be a very small part of the waste stream but it is symbolic of our throw away society so we do need to do something to curb their use
good morning already the first few fans are gathering at wembley the f. a. cup final is always one of the highlights of the sporting calendar this year's one is perhaps just a little different l. don't think even the most optimistic portsmouth or cardiff fan expected their team to get this far one of the unlikeliest cup final in this recent years
bring it back to wales eighty one years we have been waiting
good luck card it
i want to see you lifting that cup on
cup final songs take your pick between cardiff's blue birds flying high and and portsmouth's owed to their manager harry a paris harry redknapp's side are also a surprise finalists portsmouth's only f. a. cup triumph was in nineteen thirty nine
i conducted a major investigation on this for the london assembly one of the main concerns is landfill we produce thirteen billion of these things every year most of them end up in landfill and they can take several hundred years to buy a degrade l. am not going to pretend it is the biggest
it is obviously a very visible symbol of the throwaway society the experience in the northern ireland showed that when they introduced their carrier bags levy it had knock on effect on consumer attitudes on a whole range of environmental issues and people got more conscious about packaging recycling and so on rather than as being diversionary it was actually in the republic of ireland very good at getting people thinking
in the world that taxing plastic bags and isn't it interesting that politicians have their vocab real one word tax maybe two ban there isn't scrap of evidence anywhere in the world that taxing plastic bags changes people's irresponsible habits to things like lettering we have really got to have national education campaign on littering on irresponsible littering forget this issue of plastic bags which is a pure political diversion and an opportunity for another stealth tax
what do you say
i think it is sad that the carrier bag industry is just fighting this sort of war against what is inevitable consumers want to get rid of plastic bags they want to start re using bags but we do need a bit of a stick as well as a carrot a levy has worked very successfully in ireland l. would apply it to paper bags as well it is single use banks that i have a problem with we want to encourage people to get reusable bags cloth bags
regulations on all sorts of packaging i think that the government needs to be concentrated on that as well
how come the pressure seems to be focused on the customer when they are trying to do their best with increasing number of plastic bags and more pressure is not being put on supermarkets to limit the amount of stuff going into the bags
i don't think a levy on plastic bags is putting undue pressure on customers they have still got the option to buy a bag of they are caught short they just have to pay a levy that is working well in ireland l. totally agree that we need to be introducing tougher regulations on excess packaging l. am sure there will be people on the packaging industry which says that will be terrible and we should be reducing packaging industry will always try to stymie regulation but we do need to move forward
i am very well it is saturday are l. am slightly rested but very excited about the show the first person we have on his extraordinary one of the greatest stars of the young ones and now acclaimed author alexei sayle fantastic to have you here we expect some jokes or a bit of humour
summer mushroom
really delicious and the great man himself what are you going to do for us
this is relating to the chinese town of beichuan in the sichuan province reports this morning that a lake had burst its banks further up the valley which caused panic in the town we have eyewitness accounts from our reporter who is there paul danahar he reported that those people who were trying to help victims trapped in the rubble ran foyer their lives as

holidays are always expensive so even if you are only ask to do pay surcharge of a few per cent extra it can make a real dent in your holiday money but some smaller tour operators believe there is no reason to make customers pay a surcharge in the first place

so a. r. most travel firms aren't adding a surcharge but they could do so in time for summer especially if the pound starts to fall again against the euro the travel writer alison rice is here
good morning
i will it is very excite the f. a. cup final will get under way in five hours' time cardiff will fry to spring a surprise against premier league portsmouth in wembley for the first time since nineteen ninety five the team outside the big four will win the cup our reporter andy swiss is at wembley good morning andy today's match up is proof that the people's game isn't just about the top four that's right it is well over a decade since none of the top four made it to the f. a. cup final many people would argue this year it is a good thing a lot of the finals over recent years haven't exactly been particularly thrilling but instead we have two teams with no real f. a. cup pedigree to speak of cardiff haven't reached the final since nineteen twenty seven ports mouth since nineteen forty nine it is perhaps suitably surprising line up to tournament full of surprise the f. a. cup always brings to light wonderful stories and a seventeen year old boy from caerphilly in
it's an amazing feeling it's great we have this opportunity and to go with a club like cardiff to the f. a. cup final and not going there just to make up the numbers just going there to battle and to give a go and hopefully bring the cup back
they finished eighth in the premier league they beat manchester united on their way to the final and they have plenty of international talent the likes of david james in goal sol campbell in defence kanu up front they didn't have a great end to the season they lost their last four matches who knows in this f. a. cup season that has been full of surprise cardiff could yet spring a surprise in the final
is that a question for sell inna
taking part in the annual moon walk marathon starting at midnight fifteen thousand entrants will power walk twenty six point two miles across the capital to raise money for breast cancer
you will have to wear a card began
i don't think i'm going be in just a bra will be too cold
e. u. i'm going to try
one hundred men very small on the male front
cancer can settle have what does the moon walk do
it raises lots of money last year five million tonight they are hoping to raise six million that goes towards vital help for women with breast cancer walk the walk has just donated eight scalp coolers to the royal marsden these machines can help to maintain your hair so you don't lose your hair with chemo at the moment the access to these coolers is very patchy across the country the charity is hoping by two thousand eleven everywhere in the country they'll have access to scalp coolers
it is like with the morrison mouth and people have very personal stories kansat has affected their lives very directly marathon
you feel like it is girls uniting together to fight breast cancer women will get it at some point in their lives all of us coming together you feel like you're really tried to do something
watching them come out
the money i'm sure it is very nice but it was one way of getting it out in the open without having to repeat it endlessly
brought up in a suburb of montreal autumn kelly has described her background as normal those who know her believe she will cope well as a member of the royal family
she is not only intelligent and very pretty she is also one of the boys she will stand her ground
why would she be put off the chief aphrodisiac for a woman is a castle we grow up on those fairy tales and we think we are going to be rescued by a night if i had been hair i would have been quiet that i was canadian that might have been more quiet about that
do you understand why he he didn't tell her
in case she only loved him because he was tall
i think it is rather sweet it gave them a chance to know each other without that getting involved the first thing you would want to know is all about the royal family
frankly i don't believe it l. find it very hard to believe she didn't know he might not have told her but i suspect some had
i understand why he would not want to tell her who would want to marry into the royal family you would be the edmund hillary of social climbing and they are all hyphenated who would want to be in there
do you want to confess to anything you didn't tell your partner
married in brussels she was twenty four and i was fifty seven months after we married i found out she is the heiress to a diamond corporation
that can't be true
man before live with a man before you marry him you need to know these things
not too soon l. think you have to get him hooked first and start to divulge the bad habits
i think it is interesting what you said that you google boyfriends i'm sure that is not that unusual
people always get found out you just think if you are going to do this elaborate hoax one day it is going to come crashing down

did you have all the doors and windows locked up
the fact is you are going to face either your food heaven or hell if i was to ask you an ingredient which you love to eat what would it be
you can't cook the perfect roast chicken whole that is not possible because the breasts always cook before the legs l. swear by that
you are saying because of the different textures of the leg and the breast you don't agree
yes the breasts always cook before the legs
i see can't you take the legs off and roast them a bit longer while you eat the breast
little boy around town you have worked some of the great masters
can you chop those
yes sure
i will take bit to stuff the bird
salt and butter in there
no one egg yolk
and then the herbs go in
the value it's are going in
that is your
do you bake chickens inside things is that something you do
i used to bake a chicken in clay it is fantastic it does keep it moist and the flavour it cannot escape anywhere so jun is right the way he cook the chicken he cook perfect chicken it does not mean he will cook it better than me
later on we know about the oflet challenge you two the omlette challenge you two will go head to head we will have some surprises for you both
show call this number a few of you will be able to put your question to us live later on also gennaro will do a live web chat after the show back to jun this sauce a little bit of
you can use regular white wine regular to cut through the richness i will finish it off with creme fresh
why rather than cream is it a more stable sauce
no i prefer the flavour of creme fresh the best part is when you crack it open all the aromas that come out but you have sog soggy skin you you take it off the bone and crisp it up it is
off twenty five minutes
in the of
off twenty five minutes in the of enit will be
slightly pink add that heat to crispy skin it feels to n. e. it is such a shame to all those lovely flavours you
is there not do it without so much salt we do it without so much salt we won't worry about that it is
salt which flavours up if there is salt which flavours up if there is loads of flavour nothing is
fair enough crust with a whole sea bass or use it for what other things could you do the best
roast beef ever fillet of beef in salt crust i swear to you you swear to you you will not cook another piece of beef in
way i run a beef try it i will the food are cooking now it looks are cooking now it looks precise is this the sort of food you expect to eat if you came to pearl expect to eat if you came to pearl i
am going to put this on my lunch menu in a couple of weeks menu in a couple of weeks lunch is a quick service thing a quick service thing it stays warm inside the crust warm inside the crust you can do them
ready to go for service can them ready to go for service can i make that the day before put it in the oven and have it for all the oven and have it for all my friends coming around rather being stressed the being stressed the salt crust once
it looks delicious
rels and morrels alexei you have the first taste
the best part is the crusty skin
it looks fantastic
you said we had to feed you first before you started to tell us jokes
before i became amusing
is fantastic
perfect i love it well done to you it is nice one
it is not too oaky it is fresh which matches well with the peas and broad beans
do you like it
i am pretty much wine elite ter rate if it doesn't make me want to fight it is good
it is such a beautiful chicken fantastic
it can be expensive another flat frish you can try at home is bril
i have
recipe which can be cooked on the barbi it is cooked inside a banana leaf you you had it before
i was if the b. a. nana leaf
this is a beautiful brill it is a flat fish it has a fillet ofrpb that side and that side you end up with wonderful white fillets here which i have taken the skin off l. will serve that with a dressing made with some sarki sesmi sauce it is asian in feel and flavour basil and thyme ginger sping onions and carrot the idea is it cooked together as a simple parcel and steams while i make it up you of course were involved in what i say was the rock'n'roll of comedy
wild ways now you are settled down
that is all of us in life isn't it we have a bowl and some japanese rice wine sesmi oil not too much now the vegetables need to go on i will concentrate a bit otherwise i may hurt my fingers shred it thinly you are an ambassador for liverpool the cultural city
capital of culture
tell me you must be proud of that
has it changed a huge amount since you were a child growing up
massively when i was growing up it was still a complete victorian city really then the kind of city council in the sixties decided it would be a good idea if they demolished everything it was almost like being a resident of hiroshima everything between my house and river was destroyed l. interview my wife she lived off a road and her area was flatened and they were moed to a tower block that has given me i am a heritage nazi now to have the whole city removed was a traumatic experience it has taken a long sometime for a long time for liverpool to recover from that now the city centre is full of confident
it is hugely vibrant now
incredible bars
i have carrots basil thyme spring on anyon and the sauce you buy these in florist if you cannot from the veg man put it over the flame it will change you toast the banana leaf it is hard to wrap parcel newspaper a banana leaf which is stiff toast it over the flame this is a clever trick which few people knew before while it is warm crunch it up like paper that becomes mallabl and you can do what you like we will steam the fish in this parcel classic french food don't you do it
banana leaf we put the vegetables in the middle with the sauce l. think it looks good but hey it's my cooking you fold up the parcel into a purse if you wrap it up nicely you can do that as well grab some string which i have standing by l. will tie it up this show you are doing on b. b. c. two tell us about it
it is a kind it is a personal history it is about me going back to liverpool after leaving thirty years ago it is about how the place has changed it is also a history of the city it is looking at why liverpool is why it is the place it was it is not a big city really it is so famous so many entertainment stars
when does it come out
june sixth
chuck this in the oven twelve minutes all the moisture under a barbeque would cook it from underneath l. love this sort of food drop it on there you will eat this young man then you snip this watch this snip the string open up this parcel in here is all our beautiful steamed fish goodness smell that
you said you had to eat
free food mum
what do you think
it is amazing it is incredible
what will i cook for alexei at the end of the show will he butternut squash it is cooked in curry paste cooked in coconut millment and lime pickling it is left to simmer garlic and chile on top or food hell custard over puff pastry bake it until it is crisp and gold zered with classic straw berry romanoff what do you think which is your favourite
straw berry
i like it it's a flop of fruit
gennaro has suer swordfish recipe for us first time for indian food from anjum anand today she is cooking spicy lamb burgers for lads to enjoy during the cup final
there goes my coriander i'll take some green chillies to add into it and the onions
excellent just mix it all in
very peppery very aromatic
cool
like ricotta it smells like ricotta too it smells the same
good nice crumbly texture
in charge all alone
no way
absolutely fantastic
it has to be strawberries beautiful sweet flavour straw berry all the way
you will have to be nice tore people i think cooking next street a man who radiates passion which is as hot as the mediterranean sun itself it can only be one person gennaro contaldo we love your passion tell us what you will cook for us
look at this beautiful fish beautiful lemons l. l. will do griddled and steamed fish we have seasonal salad l. will make a sauce with lemons well done janet she
put a nice bit of water in the nice griddle fantastic ly gi you a hand any way i will give you a hand any way i want you to do this can you smell the fen nel
imagine you have the juice of lemon the basil all the rest inside it is fantastic fresh l. will help you do this put them all inside
apart from the celery you grew up on the coast why london
swordfish is a very thick fish
anything else tuna is fantastic john dory is another fish you can
use i prefer grey mullet to do it it is fantastic as well to do it many other fish you name it l. prefer this one because this is the way i was brought up catching this particular fish
i am going to give you some john torode food facts now did you know the largest swordfish ever caught weighed half a tonne half a tonne of fish imagine that with the size of that swordfish
where was he caught
unless you are in australia and you would eat them at christmas time
it is indeed
you have been busy wroiting a book
i have been busy
it rather than grilling it
you can see the fish is all the moistness is there then again i will put more water inside
also you don't get the smell in your kitchen
you don't l.
i have to make a a sauce again you can get all the recipes including this one they are on the website the website address is as a special treat gennaro will do a live web chat after the show put your questions straight to him and on we go so you are making a dressing for salad the swordfish is on we are onwards and upwards here
we are going for it we are nearly done l. put mustard inside a couple of spoons olive oil lemon again fish marrys with lemon so well it is wonderful
you have mint in there you think of mint and lamb because the fish is so big and heavy it seems to take it up well
the fish smells beautiful and there's our plate
i made this is mint marjoram and lemons goes on top like that and don't forget the last it the last bit i want some olive oil on top it is a gridleed and steamed swordfish with a beautiful seasonal salad
it keeps on coming swordfish and salad what do you think of that
think it is fascinating this whole thing about steaming it on a grill you have got the griddle bits which hold the fish above the pan
normally because i find it dry by doing it that way it keeps it moist moist
we will go back to wembley moist to see what olly has chosen to go with the swordfish gennaro's swordfish offers a chance to try other wine think about it mint this dish is all about freshness it has got to be a white wine f. we look around under the bonnet of gennaro's salad there is fennel we need a wine with more poke and a touch of spice it could only be this bring it on this wine is made by one of austria's new exciting generation of wine makers if you are a fan of fresh white wine try this it is almost like it is wearing a sense of humour and a jet pack it has power and zip that will work with the mustard and peppers in the sal lad plus fantastic texture which will work with the meatyness of the swordfish
what a lovely man let's taste the wine now
it is interesting this idea of this sweet wine to go with fish it is summery
well done oh my god
it is not italian
so what so long as it
is good wine who cares it it is delicious perhaps a little early in the morning
we have all been up early
see what happens next
he does make the best
i have some factory goumey which is pork belly am looking for inspiration on how to cook it
chef's favourite loads of flavour
if it is a block put it in
freezer cut cubes fry them off until crispy add it to broad beans len fills slice it around some chicken stuff it with prunes and put it in the ofen
heaven heaven the
don't remove the bones n. a little bowl mix garlic capers a little bit of olive oil lots of herbs close it up with a bit of string olive oil fry or bake when it comes out it is delicious
heaven or hell for alexei
i think it will be heaven from me
thank you what is your question
when spice is added to food it is when they are cooked or like flowers do they have to be cooked to achieve the proper characteristics of the dish for example could you put raw curry powder in a dip without any form of cooking
i wouldn't advice it the thing about spices is they have natural oils put heat to them the oils come out do it separately in a dry pan then add it to your food it will taste so much better heaven or hell for alexei
it will have to be the same as everybody else but heaven for old alexei
to a special prize as it is cup final this for you there you go but of course although you have won it today we need to do the times have you beaten your time what is the time do you think
i don't know i have no idea
they are lieing in that bowl laughing at me it is not the greatest hardship in the world to eat strawberries l. think missing people like me because of my charming nature it will e. my charming nature i will get my food heaven
that much i will start off with butternut squash and do a fryed
garnish on top if you can do the butternut squash and potatoes big chunks l. will start this curry a couple of secrets about curry this is a thai red paste which you can buy in most supermarkets get a decent one if you are going to cook it they are all premade you don't need to bash it yourself you take the red curry paste put in some oil l. will not use the coconut oil today you start to fry it off you smell that lovely asian thai flavour l. will drop the egg noodles in any sort of noodle would do this is my next big secret start it off and then you add to that palm sugar the reason i am doing that do you want any idea why palm
sprouts bring me some women now a ferrari painted green
i put the prawns on top of the sauce they need to boil up it is quite saucey still the pulp in the potato breaks down if you want great flavour in this you need to add some classic asian seasonaling it is sweet coconut cream some fish sauce that instead of salt it smells like someone's bad breath but it tastes delicious look at that this is my secret grend this is lime pickle my secret ingredient this is lime pickle l. am sure growing up in liverpool you would have it with chips
and starts to get lots of flavours the sweat sour hot l. think i have burnt bits in my frying pan something had to go wrong today it has all gone so well so far and then our prawns prouns are in prawns are in here been shoots and basil the prawns will turn pink which is what i need to do they don't need too much cooking people boil prawns to death and they are not very tastey at all what i have also done i had some pumpkin before l. have taken the seeds out of the punk kin just some pumpkin let's put some fresh chillis on top i used the lemon grass that is the stick that goes in there the first one is burnt that is why you need professionals in the kitchen so they look after you the noodles are boiling away they take hardly any time at all and our big bowl so why is it do you think that you have got your food heaven people love you
yeah l. think they have we were talking with your guests and stuff they all remember being frightened of me when i was on the young ones it is relief because people remember me from the young ones think thought i was aggressive then they find out i am not bursting through walls
a ted di bear
oh ellie speaks it is brilliant you can put the noodles on the sauce if you want mut noodles if you want to this is an easy way to do it can you pass me a big spoon please
that is spoon yes chef spoon chef
take out the lemon grass take out the prawns put it over the noodles with the curry sauce if you make the sauce this way put whatever you like into it chicken works as well with our pumpkin now we will put your garnish on top

it cost me but i've got it what hellcat's real record yeah look he's not a real entertainer five bank robberies two diamond heists and a late video return what was it the empire strikes back oh yes
vintage mark hamill good choice yeah
the point is he pulled strings for an easy stretch
we should let the governor know
it could be risky if hellcat finds out it was us he'll get us
of course there is another way
what
yoo hoo governor over here what are you doing oh hello yoo hoo over here
my latest discovery oh yes sorry to interrupt sir but let the lad speak
i think our newest arrival has something to tell you come this way i think he doesn't quite fit in

what are you talking about you say you're a magician
but what if the governor asks you to do a trick
you got a point now woodrow here
the warlock from worksop has agreed to show you some moves yeah
what's the catch
well perhaps you could be just a tiny bit nicer to everyone
you got a deal no coloured hankies though
right so it's agreed we get him a slot on the freedom show then we throw it to let him win to get rid of him right yeah just need to persuade the governor to put him on the bill
oh dear we're doomed only an idiot would fall for that
everyone all right in here ping

this is inhuman we have an intolerable situation created by a natural disaster it has been made into a man made catastrophe by the negligence and the neglect and the inhuman treatment of the burmese people by a regime failing to act and allow the international community to do what it wants to do
good afternoon welcome to wembley for the two thousand eight f. a. cup final a cup final with a difference with the giants slayed we will have a winner from outside the so called big four for the first time in thirteen years will it be cardiff city or portsmouth they have both won it before but never in colour
as a kid you watch the f. a. cup it was the one game of the year
who would have thought a pompey cardiff final
a thousand to one the bookies had on us
it doesn't actually roll off the tongue cardiff city in an f. a. cup final
people get blase every year chelsea man united liverpool for our fans it is special for the people of cardiff it's something special the quarter finals i would not have given us or cardiff a chance
it's not the norm for us or harry's team it's cardiff versus portsmouth
it's tough being the favourite
i'm going to do battle with him for ninety minutes
thank you very much this is katie and katie how excited are you
very excited can't wait
oh yes blue army
have a great day
thank you
it's the fans' final we are still a couple of hours away from the teams coming out we will try to keep you entertained until then he is a flavour of what we have got for you here is it is twenty eight years since eighteen from outside the top flight won the f. a. cup we will look
it has been an extraordinary season of upsets in
a first hand account of what it is like to be a football fan in south wales we will reflect on portsmouth's only f. a. cup when back in nineteen thirty nine
i feel very happy
the win
away with a victory
if we could go away for the summer having won the
we had supposedly the big build up to the great final of all time and it petered out
we had a non event last year it was the best advert for cricket i had seen for ages listening to the supporters at the top of the programme it is completely different they don't think they will ever be back in an f. a. cup final and they are probably right so it is a big day out a big weekend smiles on everybody's faces it's grade
so long since either side won the f. a. cup you were probably not at i the final
i do but i will let you motty
they held the cup for six years
because of the war
second world war of course
bit anodyne sometimes we are lucky we are here all the time f. a. cup final day you think oh the f. a. cup final but you get the sense that the romance is back in the competition some unbelievable results on the way through lots of glory and glamour you just hope
i am asking
it will
monte's saved the goal from ian we didn't wear club suit we did not go to the tailor and get measured up
we did it was the first sued we had ever had suit big lapels bloody great ties one of the perks of the f. a. cup final
apart from a few tickets to make a few quid you got the soup suit you need a bit of brilliance
trevor's diving header there is
usually a moment in the game
always remember forget to it was now header against the bar
sammy mcilroy
from then on you get a feeling l. thought this is
clean through and i stuffed it into alex stepney's legs l. thought what a prat
getting ready to give it the old windmill with your arms
let's be fair the most amazing f. a. cup moment must have been trevor brooking's diving header come on
it has to be
very harsh
he has
not had to comb his hair since then
it was roasting hot and it then was great because i slowed everyone down with my pace the lucky pot was stewart had a shot and it went across the six yard box rocky part straight towards me
what did you think when you thought this has got to be a diving header something must have flashed through your mind you had never headed the ball in your life
i was standing in the middle of the six yard box with my hands on my hips l. got a head at once per season no one believes that a header once per
season i want proof
the amount of energy we expended that day you know we were like animals unbelievable our game was not a dirty game but we were playing leeds who had reputation
leeds used to work at all out beforehand let's be fair not a dirty team they would kill you
richard tried to laid to rest the notion that you could kick somebody in the first five minutes and you're not going to get sent off horrendous tackle he got away with
we are going to stand up to them
we didn't feel anything
paul allen seventeen the first experience which a lot of players perhaps cardiff in particular will have this time to be honest paul allen played as if it was just a run of the dull match at seventeen run of the mill they don't realise how big it is
iain turner had an unbelievable game he saved us in the first half bobby stokes scored the winner they are all dying now you are the only goalscorer left
as a goalscorer myself it has been a focal point for my life in the last twenty eight years the number of arsenal taxi drivers in london that i get in the taxi it hit me on the head and i don't know what i was doing two or three of these players they will do something and it will be life changing experience
filled with champagne and we drank champagne on the pitch
the whole day for dubai flew by the next
black market for a testimonial
it does and it goes very quickly it is such an open game today he said seven to one up if it was cardiff city seven to one portsmouth have not played well recently and up to date we may
they were the three under dogs but the biggest shock was wimbledon in nineteen eighty eight beating we have poor live a poor liverpool that was the winning goal but he never gets remembered as the hero
i never thought of john aldridge would scored that day would squawk that day scored scored that day
an f. a. cup winning hero of the sta twenty years ago can you believe that
look at the excitement it is like a rolling back the clock
this is brilliant everyone is pleased the f. a. cup is back at its home wembley it is back to
forgive me but we get on now do do you
have to do extra homework i i have had a good luck at cardiff and it is important because the players are not as familiar and you need more background
that day wimbledon one and they deserved it but he said that it was good for football that annoys me wimbledon are one macro wimbledon won
might this be your last final
so everybody is telling me i read it in a few papers so it has to be right
are you emotional
i have had a good run and your time comes eventually so i will treat it like the others and join it and enjoy it
we were dreaming for another in the forty fourth minute they equalised and hopefully now they will go on to win because that will be a great history this was pure magic and it will be forever
cardiff city have arrived that is dave jones the manager they are very early two hours before kick off their plan to enjoy their day
i used to like to get that as late as possible what are they going to do for two hours
jimmy floyd hasselbaink walking in
like west bromwichthey like to play football and we saw what west bromwich did against portsmouth l. think they have a real chance they came up by train yesterday
we could have a welsh winner which would put them in the uefa cup special dispensation
why not if you deserve you deserve to be few win that the cup
kevin ratcliffe is with ray stubbs
you played in four f. a. cup finals can
harry redknapp will be nervous he has not won anything as a manager or player he will want to win as much as anything
what should cardiff do
they have good quality set pieces and a few surprises portsmouth will not be used to playing against players like this so it is the unknown of which is sometimes dangerous
do you for experience or plate young players
a few can excelthey seem to have no fear but i think he will stick with the tried and trusted no shocks
does this bring back memories
part two of the giant killing story it was in the third round and the first to feel the mr. week was every ten of and david moyes three all the misery was ever town it was the greatest goal for gary mcdonald league one huddersfield knocked out birmingham city this winning goal caused the mass got to lose his cool he is under there somewhere mass got what the third round is famous for on non league sides you are a small league club what do you need a player that knows the game with the knowledge it looked like this player had reached his final destination you are forty four but you have plans
i am doing their knowledge to be a taxi driver you off thirty four
then along comes the f. a. cup the closing
his strike meant they travelled back for the replay and the wheels came off
to get the ball and we could not believe it everybody was up in the air
it is that man
you cannot believe how this story is turning out and then you draw the team that you support
steven gerrard toros the best achievement of my footballing career a toros
the last time cardiff fans were at an f. a. cup final was when the old wembley was still the new wembley and here they are here is the truth cardiff have lifted the f. a. cup ben how does it
one day it could happen explain why
i play for cardiff academy hopefully one day i will be able to do this
walking out of wembley park tube station is that enough to inspire you to get your head down and work hard and play for the team one day
make its first appearance at wembley explain
to watching the f. a. cup final on television to be here is absolutely fantastic
net season cardiff in the uefa cup next season how do you fancy watching cardiff in europe if they win
the charity shield and europe if you do the ayatollah for me i am sure we will be seeing plenty of this today portsmouth have only won the cup once nineteen thirty nine since then the closest they came to reaching the final was nineteen ninety two when they played liverpool in an epic semi final the biggest game of their lives some of these players mcloughlin a great save surely bruce grobbelaar again ian rush hits the bar jim smith's portsmouth still holding liverpool clarke of the line a good looking ball a real chance for darren anderton it is there portsmouth are in the lead in the semi final ronnie whelan liverpool have equalised liverpool out of jail no more than four minutes to go dean saunders a good save mcloughlin we are into a penalty shoot out to decide who goes to wembley he shoots wide what a bad penalty john beresford has to score that's it liverpool are in the f. a. cup final it is a cruel way for portsmouth to have their moment of glory denied the portsmouth manager that day jim smith joins us lovely to see you
and you
both occasions in the first game ronnie whelan scored and he should
not have been on the pitch surely surely not
alan mcloughlin missed a great chance there just before the end he missed header which he normally put away we let ourselves down on the penalties
you had two spells at portsmouth first as manager and then you came back with harry you will be cheering them on today close friends with harry
and a friend of dave's as well l. can't go wrong
you're certainly safe you have worked with harry how will he be for
did you see them play
are bit worried today thinking if it is the same as that cardiff have got chance
in some ways because they have come here you would not expect to be the favourites being portsmouth but playing a team from a lower
should i say and make them want to play go in there
no english manager has won the cup since joe royle guided everton to victory against manchester united in nineteen ninety five that will change today guy mowbray had a round of golf at celtic manor with dave jones who has a brass name but is definitely english a welsh name
once i have beaten you it should go pretty smoothly the easiest bit of money we have ever taken
everybody's up for it excited about it
a whole city is a buzz the whole city it doesn't roll off the tongue cardiff city in the f. a. cup final a great achievement for the boys for the football club we are going to give it a good go have another go
this is the level of my golf l. am happy with that
for a championship club to get to the f. a. cup final now i think it will be a long time before it happens again
the cup of shocks might be given us another
a lot of chairmen in the premiership will be looking and saying hang on this is a route into europe why are we not there hopefully if we win it we will be in europe and it will be another milestone in the club's history we are trying to build a lot of things at the club at the moment a new stadium a new training ground fantastic for everybody it is like a new club
you have to cross few borders to get to my ball have you thought about the date itself yet dave
as a kid the build up to the day everyone wanted to watch it ten o'clock in the morning seeing helicopters overhead going down wembley way now all of a sudden as my son said the other day it doesn't seem real dad is going to lead at eighteen in the f. a. cup final l. feel really honoured lead out a team for the players the staff we will only enjoy it if we come away with a victory
club hopefully in the summer we can bring in three or four players which will give us a good chance of trying to get out of the division f. a. cup final this year promotion next year moving to a new stadium
i am it took a lot of hard work by the chairman the board everybody associated with the club to get where we are
cleared of all child abuse charges the former southampton manager david jones the judge said mr. jones left the court as he entered it an innocent man
had to go through l. have gone through it it doesn't bother me talking about it in any way it happened it's part of my life that i have to live with when the muppets start to say things they should not say because they don't really know what went on l. will put up with all of that what i am interested in is making sure i do my job well i look after my family well if i do that i hope that you get blessed with winning something
what an emotional day for a real football man david jones the
cardiff manager cardiff city f. a. cup winners how does that sound
that would be an achievement for this football club and myself and everybody associated it would rate right up there amongst something very very special but i know harry and i know his team will be difficult if we play to the best of our ability we will give them a good game if they are slightly off we showed against middlesbrough that we can beat premiership clubs we will be doing our damnedest to do it again
all the best for the cup final
a pleasure l. really enjoyed the day
i hope you're much
more successful at wembley cameras cameras put me off
he looks very relaxed today this was a few minutes ago at wembley stadium conditions are somewhat different than they were at celtic manor a lot of rain falling on a very grey wembley stadium we are joined by lord kinnock cardiff and no less
sixty one years
just sixty one you have had long wait
indeed l. expect to be back again for the same kind of occasion in the rest of my lifetime
three times i have seen city we have lost and i couldn't bear the responsibility of turning up so she is watching on the box she didn't want to come l. said that's just superstition she said this from the guy who is going to wear the same time the sensuous the same socks as the semi final at the same shoes
red socks
she is
probably worried about your language if you get beaten
i just go off and bang my head against the wall if we get beaten l. am a depressive loser
very capable good footballing side we are smaller faster and a lot of skill i think that because we have got nothing to lose and everything to prove a combination of speed skill and the fact that we have not had any luck through the season yet
catt to let except in the cup maybe except in the cup maybe
a bit of this at the end we have seen you do that here he goes you lose your hair doing that
that is how i wore it out
it does not always pay to be the favourite as you know yourself
absolutely in my case i was not the favourite and i proved it whereas this time we are the underdogs
who is the star man today
joe ledley jimmy floyd is playing l. think robbie fowler will be on the bench that's terrific he is a great boost for the team peter whittingham has got immense skill but joe ledley is
and it this week it is trying to make sure everybody get their share we have had training has gone well and everybody is looking forward to it
you have got a lot of confidence
we have not come to make up numbers and a lot of people have made portsmouth favourites because they are the premiership club but we will have a go and it is not as if we are playing manchester united or chelsea so we think we have a chance wait and see
ramsey a
your t. hat your team have to play with great intensity you have to lay you have to let the way of expectation get to them at
we have to play our own game at at we have international players a game we are playing a quality side from the premiership so we will have to be at our best but we have done it before
what are your emotions about this
i have never been to an f. a. cup final i have got close a few times but nothing will give me greater pleasure than leading out the team today when the whistle blows i will be doing battle and hopefully it will be a good game at a good game we have brought a bit of romance back and i think it will be great
in a
thank you for talking to us
he gave us his line up and substitutes which did not include robbie fowler
apparently robbie fowler said he would tell him that if he was not fit so he is not dave jones i think he will be selling to his players to the fact that they can win today portsmouth are favourites but that has not sat particularly well with them so the more you build up to this game it you are looking at cardiff and thinking they can
all sorts of people come to finals but what about australian cricket players
i have been joined by legend from another sport former australian test captain it does not come better than this
the stadium is fantastic or one of the greatest
portsmouth ace city of surprises whatever away fans arriving at the station think this is a stadium
our football club and city with
rare place in history and a rare brand of loyalty portsmouth harbour is one of the world's great anchorages and has been so you might guess that this cannot our greatest naval dockyard has the world's largest active dry dock lord nelson embarked on his final journey from here in one thousand eight hundred five on his way to his victorious but fatal battle at trafalgar but did you know that charles dickens is one of the city's most famous sons or that fratton park is located on an island separated from the mainland you would need to have spent the last month on of the moon it not to be aware that portsmouth are in the f. a. cup final again their first since nineteen thirty nine at
mr. chamberlain it still hopes a new europe might be built without the tragedy of mack of mr. chamberlain tragedy of war
one hundred thousand were at wembley among the hopeful supporters was this man
the memory is fantastic the excitement grew and i could not wait to get an f. a. cup ticket l. got one for the price of two shillings and sixpence a half a crown the idea of issuing tickets was new and players prepared with bike rides and helping him out the grounds man at and helping out the grounds men
it portsmouth had the worst
in it went and that was it we were on the our way
follow had left for portsmouth two months earlier jock anderson added another at and after the break this was the most memorable goal the expense of the
portsmouth when that they to get that were sin binned play up pompey play up pompey when that they were sinking when they were singing
as we see it now because when they will that means pompey and when that they wink the link
would take nearly half a million pounds to replace them a petition
just weeks after the joy of winning at wembley came the misery of war the threat of invasion from the sea and bombing from above almost a tenth of homes in the city were destroyed fratton park was a building a yard for decontamination units as football up stopped portsmouth became the only club to hold on to the trophy
in it went out to a public house north of portsmouth in a small village it was kept that away from the bombs it was kept there
the fact we held it for seven years gave it the opportunity to go to different places people were allowed to see it and get their hands on it that was what
we were a huge underdogs and to do as well as we did and go to extra time up was great we took the lead and we thought we are going to beat them
darren anderton it is there celebrations were cut short in almost by last minute for the last minute in the last minute
takes a while but once you are here you are accepted
the friendliness of the people is fantastic
we have one of the greatest supporters you are likely to have they never stop
it is brilliant whenever you come it feels like home at fratton park
we were not of shirt for pride and not glory oh we wear shirts
the places the culture it is a humble town
if you are born in portsmouth you should follow your local team really
i am from portsmouth it is my home the home of the royal navy l. l. love it to bits
these are the scenes outside the stadium that is the portsmouth coach just arriving they got stuck in traffic and have arrived forty minutes after the cardiff coach arrived but still in plenty of time to get ready for this cup final their fans have been here for hours jake humphrey has found some of them a lot gets made about a footballing family this lot are all related they are all from portsmouth and they are all very excited am sorry we couldn't bring the sun for you you don't mind
i don't mind at all
who needs the sun when you
we are not
when did
when you
i have come from australia sydney l. would not miss it for the world
true dedication a look of disbelief in all the fans tonight what do you think of the act as their
it is great definitely going to win
i have never seen a goal like luck that two balloons making a one to two
while balloon's contributed to the downfall of manchester city they were blowing them up at bristol rovers for birthday boy rikki
i felt something was going to happen l. concentrated on hitting it as hard as i can
it's deflected in
cup for the first time in fifty years
that goal and that match made lot of headlines you had already been there previously in the competition when you played for them
we played really well against them at their ground we were lucky enough to win there byrne we were unlucky not to win there we were unlucky not to win there getting to penalties we were confident and we believe we could score we scored everyone
bristol rovers in the fourth round of the f. a. cup premier league
am a footballer l. have always dreamed the memories will live long in the fans' history l. well remember it for the rest of my life
this is portsmouth arriving harry redknapp his first f. a. cup final a very popular winner as a manager obviously family tragedy has struck in recent weeks emotional story had his other problems this season of course with portsmouth the players coming off the bus sol campbell there arsenal player winner of course with the gunners great moments these for the
in their careers
one o'clock it is a long time to think about it david james said he might shave his head but he didn't
his suit is a million times better than when he came with liverpool
the white suit
oh dear disaster waiting to happen and it did great experience david james the likes of campbell and distin and david
i am petrified but it is wonderful so exciting cardiff city don't expect to get a cup finals eighty one years l. l. have never done it in twenty one years l. will say the occasion it would be nice to win we hope to win
of it a new ground a new training ground we have just won a court case and we are at the f. a. cup final
are you close to sorting out the financial situation
yes we won in court in the middle of march there is no reason why we should not sorted the future is really bright
a you're going to be drenched will you be drenched with champagne later
i certainly hope so
you were leading the line for barnsley by rights you should have been in the penalty box when the ball came back in what were you doing
i was chasing the referee because i felt i had a blatant penalty the referee did not give it in front of the kop in
the third minute big decision in added time
things happen for a reason in that situation normally look at curling the ball into the far corner jamie carragher cut it off drilled it into the near corner and it caught out the keeper
he has won it liverpool are going out of the f. a.
in the next round chelsea came out of the hat
i know it's disappointing you always look forward to the cup final thinking it should be me out there playing it is going to be weird it has changed my life really everyone seems to know who you are that's brian howard the kids are like not just in barnsley are you the lad that scored against
muntari scores
that's one to zero
roger johnson rounded off an incredible tale of cup giant killing will there be another if ever there was a year for a shock in the final chapter surely this is it on the pitch the portsmouth assistant manager tony adams with jonathan pearce you have won this competition three times yourself as a player what do your players have to do today
concentrate be focused whatever happens even if there is music in the background stay focused concentrate play without fear if they can we have more quality than cardiff we can win it
how did that feel
quiet there is only one place to be winners the only place you want to be l. remember losing against liverpool at the millennium
always special this year even more so it is like a people's final
as long as it is a pompey final i don't mind
important for the development of the club
they can make history today it has been a long time for this club amazing for the people i am sure cardiff feel the same l. have been working here for two years they are my kind of people they deserve success
is this your last game with pompey
yeah a bit of a curve ball from jonathan pearce at the end fags very much for that very much so thanks very much and joe jordan they take over most of the coaching interesting what he was saying about bumpy playing four three three that will be when they have got the ball pompey playing four three three they were outplayed in midfield against west brom people like tony adams and
absolutely massive
cardiff city fan jeremy bering is with guy mowbray
cardiff city when did it begin
nineteen sixty eight i used to go down with my father he did football reports for the local paper and me and my brother he is eighteen months younger we would stand in the end closure in the grange end at that time cardiff were riding high in division two one season they finished third and they used to do pretty well in the european cup winners' cup so i think cardiff dog macro of my grandparents used to say that cardiff was more of a football city than a rugby city and it has the capacity to have a big club so let's hope they build on this
have a good one that enjoy cardiff city are the only non english club to have one of the cup in nineteen twenty seven nineteen twenty seven best actor knows what it is like to support them for this actor this actor
what are you doing it is a final
week of the expedition from england
cardiff it is great final we are the expedition's
do you know what cardiff city is all about the common misconception in england is that wales stands for sheep and rugby unfortunately it is a myth perpetuated by some people in wales but nothing is further from the truth or thousands like me growing up in south wales we were football supporters it was music fashion end and a bit of excess and a bit of most importantly a football a football football it is a story mirrored by most football fans over the age of thirty across south wales if you began watching as a child it your life was transformed you were making a statement particularly in south wales football was most oblique was mostly ostracised by a teachers' the establishment they wanted to maintain the status quo nothing could be seen to take that precious jewel a way rugby it is a myth perpetuated for too long the six nations is a great event but it is an event the sport is superfluous for so many choosing football you were not just choosing a sport but a lifestyle you listened to different music it went to different places and even walked differently you were sticking with up two fingers sticking up
you they are only special if you win them it is not just great to get there
they have
and harry redknapp knows that
the f. a. cup was the one game of the year the streets were empty and no one would miss it then we would go out and play football l. am sure we had a nine inch television with a three inch magnifying glass there was one game a year probably on the television and that was the f. a. cup final to be going in as a manager is fantastic
going into this week it should have been a joyous week for you but you lost frank lampard's mother how have you married the two things looking forward to the f. a. cup final and this tragedy
it was at west ham went the love affair with the f. a. cup final started john bourn was in that side they used to go to the cafe around the corner and discuss tactics using the salt cellars and the pepper pot is that when you thought that is what i want to do
we used to go round there we had two central cafes the kids were going the central one that is how i would spend my afternoons talking about football drinking about twenty cups of tea geoff coming in to bat near post getting across defenders that was new in the game to the near post greenwood brought back to west ham and it was a great place to grow up bobby moore was
great frame a great friend it is what bobby was telling me in nineteen ninety we were in italy together and he went to see you at your hospital bedside and
you have had great moments already bournemouth against manchester united the last team from a lowly league to beat manchester united in the cup and west ham at manchester united as well
yes paolo di canio scored but the date by played that was always going to be special they were the cup holders and they were a great team we were struggling third division team and we beat them two to zero and in all honesty we murdered them don't ask me l. could never explain what happened that day it has got to be the greatest day in my life and in the lives of all the players it is a great afternoon for everybody at
any team that goes to old trafford and they do not have to ride their luck they are dreaming but we are in the final now and we have got a great chance
is that the most satisfying thing you have done get them to wembley or get them into the premier league
getting them into the premier league for me was fantastic to take the club over which had been in the bottom four for five years running i didn't see any future in taking this club at that time i thought there was nowhere i could take milan convinced me to give it a go and in the first year we came and we walked away with the championship
when you lead the team out what do you think will be going through your mind the romance of it all or hang on a minute this is ninety minutes we have got something to win
no i will be concentrating on the game and trying to make sure we win the cup but want to go away on holiday with sandra in the summer and having won the cup that would be fantastic it has been a difficult year in all honesty but that would give us all a big lift
he has had quite a
he has done a terrific job
absolutely fantastic sometimes you don't get what you deserve evra would like to see him pick the trophy up everyone would if he is a bit nervous and certainly his son is jamie is in pieces ext in pieces l. don't think you can have a better dressing room than that people forget about joe jordan to have that dressing room in there and dooley those players up they have been given the best possible chance
he has shown what a valuable manager he is at west ham he had young talent lampard joe cole there is one hundred million now he has got the older talent and got the best out of them james sol campbell its sylvain distin kanu we always talk about where he is now and it is like night and day
i would have said if that happens i would jump off the boat and go for a swim but i am not going to do that
it has been quite a year
to deliver on the day
who makes your teams tick
i must say we have got some good footballers like stephen mcphail
easy for him he will make it several clubs already now are looking at him in training he stands out from a lot of other players he is a good footballer they are showing off i'm not allowed to go that fast
you are dare i say it the elder statesman now you are playing a more responsible role are you enjoying that
yeah i must say i am a more responsible than a few years ago but you know the game has changed so much i am more responsible you cannot say too much to youngsters at this time some of them you just need to let them go and do their own thing let
coming to cardiff and now they are going to wembley it is extraordinary that it should happen this way what has the response of the cardiff people been
it is amazing just before the semi final from when we played middlesbrough we had so much so good support going to the game at middlesbrough the ticket for the semi final were sold like that and the atmosphere
could you no especially not with cardiff that is what makes it even more special it is an amazing feeling i don't want to give it away
ivan gaskell getting his hands on jimmy floyd hasselbaink's big steering wheel a big game plan and a big player for cardiff today
he has got the experience but obviously the quality in the final third of the pitch he has got it he has been there seen it done it proven quality a great goalscorer alan shearer will talk us through this
what i like about him is whether it is left foot or right foot it is all about power whether it is the front of the vote or the side for it we are seeing everything here which is your power l. love that
that was power
he has got lots of pace but he has still got a little bit of movement that can set him apart
the thing is with him in a young team as well when things are going well a young team plays about fear but if they go one zero down today they look for people run have been there before he will be invaluable in there are times of the game portsmouth will have the ball but a lot so they look to him to hold the ball up
you did that with tony adams
some of us have friends with this game
from one veteran to another and thirty seven year old david james some would argue that the portsmouth goalkeeper has been in the best form of his career
portsmouth as a city portsmouth is on an island does that have an affect on supporters they do seem particularly passionate
be a do it is traditional for supporters to get in a frenzy but from the semi final onwards it has been madness
you have played in a couple of f. a. cup finals and lost twice is that unfinished business a yes i am not looking to get revenge
nineteen ninety six memorable suits
and they were great for they were a great the game is remembered more about the suit than the performance if we had one we would have been the best addressed team to have one of the cup final
did you design them to have won the cup final
i had a say but handed over the decision to somebody more accurate l. still have the suit it has grass on it
i am sure it does not fit john barnes either
let me ask you about hair people will remember you for haircuts
suits and hair cut but what a career what a career l. get bored sometimes and change it my favourite was the superman hair cut i had to do it in the morning because it was spiky i did not want to go out looking like a ten year old so i come debt
you have an afro at the moment michael owen it said its got him scoring the other week if it said said it stop him scoring it stopped him
are you superstitious about having it on one side of the other most goalkeepers are superstitious l. was debating it today and somebody said it was bad luck if i changed it today but i am not superstitious i want to shave it tomorrow i will do
the final
awful as far as performances go we have not been great but we have been playing championship sides apart from manchester united l. hope this becomes a nice victory s. victory
this is david james are warming up it is his third cup final this is david james warming up
made a lot of mistakes with his judgment you had one in ten when he misjudged but now it is about one in twenty he has had a tremendous season and i think he is one of the
has had he might win he he has kept portsmouth in the competition that is a top penalty saved
that was vital
do those things live in a player's memory
without doubt
that is the mentality of defender
you will remember it so he will be thinking about that the first one that was nineteen ninety six and he was used to making that type of mistake l.
the nineteen eighty six cup final
this is striker steve thompson
kevin mcnaughton and i started writing a song we had had two bottles of champagne and were drinking wine at and were drinking wine at
assistant manager and very good friend of lee dixon tony adams
the where is your man where is
we will get him in and minute what about cardiff and their defence
they are good at passing and playing but against middlesbrough at their defence was fantastic the two centre backs complement each other both great in the air
johnson caught my eye he was good on the ground as well he loves to tackle he takes no prisoners he threw everything at the ball in this game he reads the game well and he is strong if they will be needed in the air or not because portsmouth play on the ground it they will have to sort that out
they are a partnership they will need to complement each other today
they have scored a terrific goals in the season
at there is no doubt about that
both teams are out at the moment and the managers are talking to each other they seem it very relaxed i doubt they will be discussing tactics at this stage
both great men dave jones is a great football manager
lee dixon has been on the phone to his friend and he is ready david james goalkeeper
the super fit thirty seven year old two clean sheets speaks for itself got back into the england team well deserved
sol campbell defender
he is enjoying his football and his life that is important for him his experience is invaluable to every member of the squad they all look to him and if he is having a good day everyone is
last season but we have added a little bit of pace he has also contributed to the oh two clean sheets
glen johnson defender
pedro mendes midfielder
he is a footballer intelligent passes the ball keeps the ball he is your engine he is fantastic footballer i like watching him train he is my kind of player
john utaka midfielder
he has got pace i have seen him play in the middle i have seen him play wide he has got it all
on to him to realise that the premiership is a very pacy game he has adapted well a couple of
for me he is the player of the year l. think what we have put into him this season is his work rate we all knew his talent going forward he can open up doors for you a big talent but this season he has added a defensive side to the forward kind of things he has improved defensively
kanu striker
what can you say about kanu l. love him he has been so important to us for the last two years he has made the team tick for one so tall he has got an amazing touch and brings other people into play he is a remarkable player
there is a man with bags of experience he is used to cut vinyls big events
and one of the great centre backs for the last thirty years cup finals l. think harry has kept him going and got the best out of him this season he has been magnificent as usual very consistent this is against didier drogba the tackle was timed to
perfection they
remember again the time of the tackle is everything as fernando torres comes across no room for ralph no room for error he comes to the next one a bit square to the target but a great block what about this for a clearance in the cup this is absolutely magnificent great position and then just fix it away and a great partnership with disdain as well
you talk about the end of his career at arsenal distin
mentally if you are not bright playing at that level you have no chance harry has to look after him and he knows tony adams and he is now playing at his best
play in five or six years with you would take its toll
he has been out for the last three or four weeks so let's see if he
all the big boys take it for granted what a great day for these guys
good to see the flags
it would be terrific if like harry said both sets of supporters were there at the end l. wouldn't put money on it though
who are you going for
i'm going to go for portsmouth l. think they will be too strong for them they get the semi final at the way and they will win
i am getting alan hansen will go for portsmouth so why will go for cardiff
options are available to you if you are totally partisan hit the red button for commentary it is portsmouth as is cardiff's city versus cardiff city these fans will not remember the commentators for b. b. c. radio when the cup final was first broadcast critically in nineteen twenty seven the year that cardiff city beat arsenal and carry the trophy out of england for the only time in one hundred twenty six finals the commentator's job on that date all those years ago was to refer people to the radio times so they could picture it while they did their commentary broadcasting has
i listened to the pair of them before reversing exactly the same thing happen and it was better that time
yes and it is maybe that they will not be back again if you have a ticket you will enjoy yourself
ladies and gentlemen please let's show our appreciation for sir bobby robson
assistant martin yerby and trevor massey the fourth official chris foy who is the referee and peter kirkup because we have an assistant in reserve as well the cardiff captain is stephen mcphail it would be quite interesting if they win the cup because the club captain is a substitute so we could see a joint celebration but that is jumping the gun a great day for david jones he has overcome a lot of hurdles in his career he was having to cope with a lot of unfounded allegations at one time at southampton then he went to wolves got them to the premier league and had to endure difficult days at cardiff early on he sold a awful lot of players but he is here today a proud manager of cowbit cardiff city and equally proud now every welchman and lady present and all those watching with us as katherine jenkins sings land of my father's land of my fathers she can hit a note rapturously received and now national and some god save the queen at the national anthem god save the queen a very good start to the afternoon in terms of singing atmosphere flag waving anticipation expectation we share it appear as we wait to show you again the line ups harry redknapp going down his line of portsmouth players wishing them all the best individually here come the cardiff boys redknapp brought pedro mendes back into his midfield last week and he keeps his place as the anchor at the expense of papa bouba diop john utaka who missed the semi final through injury is part of a five man midfield initially behind kanu whose pompey back to wembley expect utaka and kranjcar to push out and make it four three to three since the semi final paul parry has regained fitness he is up front with thirty six year old jimmy floyd hasselbaink for those of you not familiar with the team peter enckelman in goal kevin mcnaughton roger johnson glenn loovens tony capaldi in midfield joe ledley may go on the left we will see gavin rae stephen mcphail and peter whittingham up the middle parry and hasselbaink robbie fowler did not make the sixty numeral but there is another veteran on the bench the sixteenth trevor sinclair is old enough to be aaron ramsey's father he is seventeen years one hundred forty four days old he would be the second youngest f. a. cup finalist ever if he wins the f. a. cup in fact he is already the second youngest player to curtis western of millwall david nugent is on the portsmouth bench roger johnson who scored at middlesbrough in the sixth round the captains with the officials sol campbell on the right f. a. cup winner with arsenal and stephen mcphail who was at leeds united and barnsley just been recalled by
the republic of ireland that was a spoof toss i think
portsmouth won the toss for collars so they will play in blue cardiff city will not mind playing in black colours it has been a lucky omen
they froze under the mantle of favourite
here we go then the f. a. cup final of two thousand eight the one hundred twenty seventh in the history of this famous competition only once has the f. a. cup been carried out of england and that was by cardiff city in nineteen twenty seven portsmouth won it in nineteen thirty nine and kept it for six years during the war and now but clubs are back here for the first time since both clubs immediately diarra gets going for portsmouth and gets a free kick l. fancy he will play a bit further forward than he did in the semi final last summer doctor
definitely mendes just sitting in playing the ball
diarra hermann hreidarsson has gone up for the first free kick niko kranjcar has put the ball down hreidarsson in the centre with his arm up the peter enckelman incidentally still on loan to cardiff from blackburn rovers makes the first save i can't believe he shot from save there on the far side paul parry came in he's got the pace forced david james to advance
released him when he was manager at wycombe it would be an irony if he
scored today a p. c. start mark a good start pacy start no free kick it was worth a try jimmy floyd knew he was not going
to go past utaka going back to his right sided position there glenn loovens the dutchman hreidarsson just making sure whittingham is covered tony adams there alongside harry redknapp he lifted the cup three
times as the arsenal captain a good break by loovens sol campbell broke it up and gave the
far forward in open play they haven't quite managed to pick out kanu yet one of cardiff's early problems will be in the centre of midfield mcphail and rae are taking on diarra muntari and mendes
if dave jones' team win the f. a. cup they would go into the uefa cup so there is a big prize today another chance for a long capaldi throw in portsmouth players slipping that is going to give cardiff city the first corner so johnson will stay forward joe ledley will take it portsmouth broke out well again they are looking for parry to use his speed to get the other side of the portsmouth back four
it's be good ploy he runs all the
channels all day parry it is
matter of dovetailing between the
two of them don't expect too many goals today portsmouth have only conceded one
in the f. a. cup so far cardiff two capaldi will take the chance to come forward when he can niko kranjcar get the put in kanu couldn't get there free kick diarra just caught hasselbaink mr. ball completely missed the ball the two cardiff city full backs will see lots of the ball today kranjcar and utaka
retreat into five man when they lose the ball it was his the third round it was joe ledley over there cardiff born a welshman through and through gavin rae a bundle of energy in midfield glen johnson did not get there it is a foul by johnson
we spoke before about someone running the other for portsmouth it has not happened yet we have seen parry already do it a couple
of times portsmouth david james a first time clearance a free kick to cardiff the two clubs have never met before in the f. a. cup this is where they like kanu to hold it up and bring others into
play it has been broken up and there is a brake on possibly for hasselbaink it was a good idea but it needs to be absolutely perfect for jimmy
floyd but the idea was good he thought he should have had a free kick and did not get it parry was in there again for cardiff and david james required
the referee has given a goal kick
a decent ball with the outside of the gut not the greatest clearance in the world but i feel with portsmouth it is like the start against west brom don't you think so
with a four three three kanu is a bit isolated isn't he
they have not hit a ball over the top at the moment cardiff looked the better team
that is certainly how it was with west brom because kevin phillips gave portsmouth all sorts of trouble david jones must feel his side had started well a free kick to portsmouth glen johnson has put the ball down waiting for hreidarsson to come forward he waits there with sol
campbell and distin the goalkeeper fumbled it nearly four kanu that was a worrying moment for peter enckelman a better spell for portsmouth that was lassana diarra peter enckelman will be delighted because he has got away with one there is no doubt about it there was very little or no pressure on him and he has just fumbled this very strange mcnaughton and loovens helped him out in the end but he should have caught it
the pass was not good
enough good skill now it is a free kick to cardiff peter whittingham is going across to take charge here does all that is the furthest forward at the moment hasselbaink loovens will
david nugent are on the bench can they get someone up with kanu this time brilliant he did bring me absolutely that was the first time someone had run from midfield which was the utaka watch his little position hreidarsson and he is away it is a great ball in as well
he once scored a goal at chelsea for arsenal from a not dissimilar kind of tight angle this time he slipped it the wrong side of the post
better from portsmouth it post certainly harry how close was that can't get much closer first time he had had any support
absolutely and we are halfway through the first half it's a free kick for joe ledley right on the edge of the area against
glen johnson glen johnson showed him that way and he went he has won himself a free kick he
has caught him no argument there whittingham and mcphail on the ball the two centre backs are forward again whittingham to take it oh it was parry who dropped back and got a shot in everybody else was bunched up in the penalty area kranjcar was well forward there but he has lost it
he delayed the past a brilliant tackle going back to the free kick a lovely chance for parry on his left for it pass
defenders probably the third
occasion we have seen this yes yes whittingham will take the corner loovens was at the back goal kick
a waste really just going back to
the cardiff free kick it was
wonderful chance portsmouth sat back six yards out from the goalkeeper a little pull back parry should have done much better hreidarsson miscue capaldi again with the throw in ledley brought down a daft foul that is
they have had plenty of corners and free kicks and throw
portsmouth's eighth place to finish in the premiership was their best ever even though they lost their last four games hasselbaink trying to get parry a way for cardiff city
it's that ball again isn't it behind the two central defenders down the sides the very successful for
cardiff in terms of territory cardiff beat chasetown hereford walls and barnsley to get here portsmouth beat plymouth ipswich preston manchester united and west bromwich albion after half an hour mark you can't really separate them
no difference whatsoever portsmouth had the best chance through kanu but i think cardiff are playing the better
football blue army lassana diarra showing nimble still in possession skill in possession
mendes
i think he's made the most mendes of it gone are the days when you used to be able to do that put your foot up and won a tackle
rather than the other way around l. just think we have probably bored everyone by saying no one is running behind kanu but there is not a lot of width
i think kanu is getting bored by it kanu is signalling now let's get around a bit more i just thought jimmy floyd might carve out a chance there for a
moment kanu will have a go yeah he did well to get himself the opening but i cannot recall too many goals that kanu has scored from twenty plus yards in his career
has got just six this season including the semi final winner jermain defoe because he played just a few minutes as a substitute for tottenham in an earlier round can't take part
how frustrating is
that i think he might make all the difference
it would
free kick difference portsmouth plenty in the middle enckelman punching away glen johnson's cross mendes has got a powerful shot
well struck unfortunately straight at the goalkeeper but the decision before by enckelman to punch from the cross was a very good one johnson does well on the right this is a good save you know loss of height and distance lots of height or offside given a nice little ball played by muntari around the corner to kanu just about still
off though isn't he yes blue army blue army sol campbell and distin have not done much wrong as a partnership for portsmouth this season johnson
penalised for pushing pompey supporters not happy with the referee not giving them any decisions i think he is doing quite well
believe i would have paid to see
that kanu is there but no is it given the assistant referee stays where he is mike dean walks away kanu and portsmouth to think they have taken the lead
well they have a brilliant cross enckelman punches it away fantastic reactions by kanu
watched the assistant referee he stops for a
no but interestingly in the semi final there was a handball by baros he reacted so quickly kanu thirty seven minutes the goal time portsmouth on top now kanu who got two winners' medals with arsenal gives the premier league
side the edge enckelman struggled to get it across as well he had to push one of his defenders out of the way get that across a supergrass
i just think that when parry got himself in the position i was thinking are you going to shoot or not because of the width here he decides not to it is a good idea but the pass was through quick
unselfish by parry
you can see why he didn't shoot because of the angle
it could have been one to one kevin mcnaughton as i said earlier had an up and down time in this competition
he made
seventy yards very quickly it is kanu's goal that separates the team as we go to the forty first minute of a half this is how it happened john utaka squeezed the cross in the goalkeeper couldn't hold on and kanu put it in there there is big long rangy legs isn't it those nineteen thirty nine the last time portsmouth were able to celebrate at wembley in an f. a. cup final parry has been their best outlet and the first half in the first half diarra couldn't pick out kranjcar
he will try again he doesn't get free kick though cardiff do mendes is saying that it hit him in the face
is there a way back for the welshman before half time this is not norton who came close a few minutes ago mcnaughton parry couldn't keep his balance pompey chimes are ringing around wembley kanu was running offside for a moment it broke up portsmouth's
rhythm john utaka caught him he is saying straightaway to the referee there is a famous fan
we have seen him before he has all the names and all the tattoos
you on not likely to forget him it is a great reaction from kanu you off you are mcphail has caught one in the mouth
been some encouraging moments they have not done a lot wrong
it back i think he has caught ledley best from it
one remit will be added at the end of the forty five from it if cardiff are going to go back to the dressing room with anything to show for this they will have to score pretty fast johnson is up there again he bounced off a portsmouth player and won a free kick sol campbell was not very happy with that free kick award and he is somebody else who is not hreidarsson eight yellow card for
a delay here before whittingham can take it can cardiff city equalised on the stroke of half time equalised equalise a bit of movement about the far post glen johnson squeezed the ball out for pompey
good defensive play sulley muntari will breathe a sigh of relief it was his stupid free kick in terms of giving it away
ledley has gone across to away take the corner david james didn't really claim that first time it has been hacked back in no goal mike dean has wiped that one out there is no doubt about that
i think the
i think the referee gives this forehands he does not give it for foul there is nothing role nothing wrong his whistle went to his mouth straight away a great finish as well
it was the dutchman glenn loovens perhaps a shade unfortunate
i do not think so l. unfortunate think it is handball everyone straight away thinks it is the foul but he was not old clock quite simply he was not filed
and the whistle blows immediately far half time and portsmouth the premier league side have the advantage the goalscorer on thirty seven minutes was kanu cardiff city who started pretty well going to the dressing room the championship side a goal behind paul parry their most dangerous attacker certainly early on but at half time it it is cardiff city zero portsmouth one the premier league side have the advantage but it has been a free flowing game and end to end stuff and either side could have led
most enjoyable we have had chances we have had excitement we have that entertainment and a goal the big thing as far as cardiff were its are concerned they have left parry up front jimmy floyd hasselbaink has caused sol campbell no end of problems they had been inventive wit they said plays but it is a cruel game enckelman made a mistake and got away with it but he made two and paid the price david james got away with it on another day it
chance great feet they break quickly here down the right hand side cardiff have got men back but when they get to the byline this is a great ball very difficult to defend against it is a mistake and kanu react very quickly to put in the back of that but you want your goalkeeper ultimately to do better
we are going to see a couple of decisions he has made he tries to catch the most difficult one he punches the two way that we are going to see
we have seen him punch too early he got away with the first one
you feel sorry for the centre half he has got no chance with that
like you say it changes the match the
they played a great free kick we keep saying this is difficult to defend against the great ball in but again what was he doing there it is a fumble
that is my point if anything you should be catching that one not doing what he is doing you are right that is nothing he has got away with it
i am not sure he could have punched it went it was a goal this is another one another good ball in that is a punch he is being decisive the big thing here as far as the back four is concerned is that your goalkeeper has got to be decisive and been the goal he wasn't in the end it is an easy chance
apart from that the back four have not been troubled the way they are playing they are playing deep and has a back four if you get your midfield players playing as hard as they can in front of you got you can play all day long
david james has had his moments in cup finals he got
i don't think it was one of mine
is quite clearly it is handball and the referee has got it spot on the mistake from james he should come doesn't get it
desperately unlucky good refereeing but desperately unlucky it might be the difference between winning and losing
we saw kanu put one away but he missed a simple one having done some brilliant work
i have seen him do this millions of times in training he has got such good feet we saw him score goal against chelsea a few years ago the first time he got behind him great feet to fitted he is falling over and things i will slot it in fantastic
what about the reaction
super feet he does the difficult things
he thinks it is in he has got his arm up
here comes harry
there is mild made tony my old mate tony they have done ever so
hit some balls behind him
let's test him and see if he is fit he has been caught napping two or three times and been fortunate there two or three yards behind him the last man if he takes a decent touch parry he is in luckily for sol campbell his pace gets away with it
i think parry has done incredibly well apart from the finishing aspect he has taken up great positions off campbell
a shot
he has got into the position time and again or whether it is a lack of confidence composure or a lack of quality a great position you have got to hit it at no stage did he look like he was going to hit it that is a great position to be in
i will go for romania because it would be funny
fernando torres
he's a genius he
sweden you
the same colour as blackpool
france the closest country to us
the czech republic the women are
unbelievable definitely it's unbelievable definitely it's ronaldo
vive la france
go on ronaldo spain what a splendid goal freddie ljungberg portsmouth's jermain defoe is cup tied he is talking to ray stubbs what's a conversation in the
the portsmouth bend went up when kanu missed that chance
we are playing well he is so relaxed kanu it was a tight angle but he made a mess of it
credit to cardiff
kanu to close the game down
definitely but when you're winning you have to be sensible keep the ball when pedro mendes gets on it he will get as playing the system from the manager is really good we get good possession keep it going we will see what happens
you can't take anything for granted but the pompey fans will go crazy if portsmouth when the cab
unbelievable they have been fantastic all season
win the cup
i am enjoying it
thank you for talking to us he must have mixed emotions jermain defoe he has been good for portsmouth he has scored a few but he cannot play in the big one
nothing worse
must be difficult a threat at times from set pieces cardiff as jermain defoe mentioned
if you wait in a ball like that gary as you know it is so difficult to defend against that is how tight it can be if the ball is good enough
harry redknapp's forty five minutes away possibly from his first major trophy what will he be saying to his players
every time
they have got to do something the lad ramsey seventeen year old wunderkind l. am pretty sure we will see him at some point whether he can turn it around
david jones will keep it the same more chances to come for cardiff it is just case of showing composure in front of goal because they have certainly had the chances as for portsmouth they are in pole position it is for them to lose now cardiff have to come back at them there will be gaps appearing in the last twenty minutes but we just hope it is as good in the second half as it was in the first
cardiff players are on the pitch portsmouth are just leaving the tunnel back to mark lawrenson and john motson no changes by either side at half time portsmouth have milan baros david nugent noe pamarot papa bouba diop and goalkeeper damie ashdown jamie ashdown cardiff aaron ramsey seventeen darren purse the club captain steve thompson often comes on up front trevor sinclair the veteran and goalkeeper michael oakes they are the choices open to harry redknapp and david jones just a point about the two managers the first time i believe since nineteen ninety one that both managers in the f. a. cup final are english david jones a liverpudlian played for everton and we all know where harry came from in fact the last english manager to win the f. a. cup joe royle in nineteen ninety five one of them has got to do it today it's cardiff city in the black strip to start the second half playing from the right play up pompey glen johnson has had his hands full with ledley roger johnson trotting up to the six yard line to be marked by kanu very much the energy in the cardiff midfield gavin rae a box to box player who came from rangers blue army diarra showed some nice touches in the f. a. staff playing in rather more advanced decision than he did in the first semi final lassana diarra first half a free kick to cardiff rae was fouled change of the ball john yes mike
gives roger johnson the chance to move forward again in the portsmouth penalty box glenn loovens goes with him whittingham
to take it out comes roger johnson the assistant referee says goal kick
johnson is claiming a corner and a great ball in it was a corner it
that does
hurt peter enckelman up looking for joe ledley and failed peter enckelman lassana diarra is playing as well as anybody
he has been very good
mick naughton charging forward here comes hasselbaink we have not seen too much of him
once it
good play by portsmouth
a a corner to portsmouth sol campbell is forward for this sulley muntari comes forward to take it peter enckelman has found jimmy floyd hasselbaink whittingham he has got to be careful he has got a yellow card
kranjcar so he has also got
yellow card now
he made no attempt to play the ball
it did he here here it is glenn loovens did he you had players left and right that it was good play for portsmouth if they had kept the ball but it is cardiff instead mendez john utaka kania in the centre at the moment the other has slowed to get forward kanu
he just needed to wait bit longer
good play there it is a free kick suddenly come into the game niko kranjcar scored here for croatia some of us would not want to be reminded about that that was against england
too late
he also scored against scotland a free kick for portsmouth and here is menders johnson mendez kanu
coming up near post corner i think that is a goal kick or a
good left foot sulley muntari just wonder how long jimmy floyd hasselbaink will last in this game
you also have a ramsey and the boy wonder who can play in any position the boy wonder ramsey it is russia macro four portsmouth niko kranjcar
he has got support from mendez glen johnson lassana has been rocked by whittingham free kick to cardiff
paul parry was trying to make a run in but nobody
saw him this is john utaka kanu is in the middle a bit of support coming forward now
he had a touch too
many john utaka is injured nearly an hour what do you see as the flow of the game portsmouth looking for a second
it has really opened now a a bit of a dangerous situation for cardiff now you feel that it might put portsmouth off the key for david jones is to
get the substitutions right cardiff have been able to develop their new stadium this is the boy they have been talking about allan ramsey left school last summer youngest ever player for cardiff city aaron ramsey
he is a real talent
that is a free kick against talent sulley muntari forward by glenn loovens offside paul parry jones makes the first change peter whittingham is going off aaron ramsey is the man to come on a only twenty four days older than curtis westerner who became the youngest cup finalist for millwall
he can
i would have thought it would be imminent change he keeps having a look jimmy waiting for the number to come up just a little word in his ear and
they are going to make a substitution as well very shortly mcphail was looking for or parry i think it nugent might be coming on
david nugent who scored the winner in the third round against ipswich
commit another man forward are
you no glancey has come across to the left for cardiff ramsey ledley has gone right
nugent will run all day for you and chase absolutely
everything campbell comes over nugent gets a free kick for a foul by rae and now with the substitution we predicted thompson coming on for hasselbaink steven thompson a scottish target man a bit unpredictable in fact so unpredictable he injured himself falling off banana boat in the united states before the season began there's one for you even you could not respond to that
thank you
he was the man who was done this song in our build up on the cardiff players doing the song into the last twenty minutes nugent wow it was worth a try did enckelman say that or did it hit the post saved that
half it is fair to say that cardiff have done themselves pretty proud as a championship side but they have not quite yet found the thrust tory to concern distin and campbell free kick a foul on loovens well ramsey playing wide right for cardiff thompson down the middle with parry a mistake by glen johnson and he's made up for it at the expense of a corner for cardiff loovens and johnson on their way forward again thompson is in there this time of course johnson he certainly wins his fair share of headers yes he takes a running jump climbs above two defenders most of the time
it is the tony adams coaching you see good movement but a poor pass that was ramsey unusual for him because he loves to run with the ball he got in a position to go
forward and commit people dave jones now knows fifteen minutes to force extra time so a chance for a long capaldi throw in kranjcar got it away for portsmouth thompson this is a good spell for cardiff finally glen johnson glad to get the ball back into the cardiff half
that spell of cardiff pressure there was a big header by sol
campbell now then papa bouba diop who was left out of the starting line up will get a chance to stiffen up the portsmouth midfield so the senegalese player who is yet to score for portsmouth although he was the player so we are told by the statistics people who had the most shots in the premier league season without scoring he's popular the cross is cleared by distin for a corner ramsay has gone across to take it thompson was jumping and coming in behind him loovens again
i think the problem is their header into the ground right in front of him but yet again a cardiff head on a ball from a set piece dangerous
obviously for portsmouth the attendance is eighty nine thousand got eight hundred seventy four eighty nine thousand eight hundred seventy four that is as big it gets in this stadium portsmouth still
lead by kanu's goal thomson is beginning to make a nuisance of himself up there now free kick there is robbie fowler tony adams was saying to them defensively try and hold the line keep it pushed up a little bit don't drop deep robbie fowler has been out with a hip injury since the turn of the year so it was pushing it to get him on the bench today that is good defending by johnson he got his body between the ball
and demand the man it has been a good battle that a conversation between david jones and his assistant on the right colour and harry redknapp on the left they have both got a bit of work to do on the right late adjustments might make the course of this game changed change papa bouba diop is flagged for a foul don't rule cardiff city out
you always feel in games like these the team that is chasing the game
always gets a chance always the corner flag takes a hit africa cardiff a throw to cardiff it is left for capaldi everybody is back for portsmouth outcomes they had from campbell again and kranjcar could start
something or portsmouth outcomes pushing good play by mcnaughton again he got his body
it is a great tackle as well been it was a brilliant run by distin when he first got it he did not have too many options but it is a brilliant tackle in the end
it was roger johnson who made the challenge but what a thrilling run from a centre back as things stand portsmouth are five minutes plus stoppage time away from winning the f. a. cup the offside flag is up another attacker coming on it is it milan baros
it must be for
will be baros for kanu that that will enable portsmouth to go a little bit longer sinclair is about to come on for cardiff city
for gavin rae i think trevor sinclair who played we are looking at kanu trevor sinclair played in the two thousand two world cup for england under sven goran
eriksson baros has come on with instructions for papa bouba diop baros will play through the middle and leave nugent on the right
milan baros who had a hand literally in the winning goal in the semi final but he is yet to score one for portsmouth this was today's goal kanu who has just gone off the
only goal of the game so far it is his first touch isn't it the thing about portsmouth is diarra is not in that attacking role any more he is sat in front of the back four where mendes was and it is almost four one four to fourteen
portsmouth there is the engraver or rather his pencil he hasn't started collecting yet will it be the name of portsmouth for the first time since nineteen thirty nine can cardiff city produce something now in the last couple of minutes it was a let off for pompey but look at the break i really thought young aaron ramsey might have pulled it out of the fire for cardiff there baros has forced a corner and paul smith breather fight a sigh of relief
the premature celebrations may have to wait a while papa bouba diop forces another corner mcnaughton is still making his way back but they have used their three substitutes cardiff have got a chance to get the ball upfield
they have to
leave mcnaughton up he cannot run if they force extra time they will be playing it with ten men harry redknapp is four minutes away from winning the f. a. cup for the first time as a manager they are getting ready to roar their team home but cardiff city may still have a say still testing that portsmouth defence except for mcnaughton who cannot run at all he is in some distress sinclair will leave the throw for capaldi again we have got roger johnson in
the penalty area thompson as well i think distin and campbell have been excellent for the last twenty minutes of the game they have got their heads on absolutely everything that has come in free kick a chance for paul smith to run the clock down l. imagine they will stick it in the corner for nugent and baros to chase portsmouth
they are so close now harry redknapp the crowning moment in his long managerial career a big moment for them too the man of the match at kanu did you agree with that
it sounds like the sponsored voted for it he scored the goal it is a daft foul by diarra
a yellow card as well cardiff have a chance to push portsmouth back with a minute to go the goalkeeper is coming up what a finish this could be to the second half it has come out to ramsey and what a block from roger johnson corner to be taken by ramsey a big finish by cardiff over the head of roger johnson seconds to go as david james seconds to go out to go out and portsmouth have won that the f. a. cup for the first time since nineteen thirty nine and harry redknapp has led them into europe for the first time harry redknapp will rules the waves in portsmouth and rules
kanu at the goal scorer the goalscorer very emotional cardiff did their bit they seriously did
we can hear from harry redknapp for a lifetime in the game how sweet is this
fantastic for everybody my family the supporters players it has been great it has been a difficult year or so to win the f. a. cup is a dream come true we are a very close family my grandchildren got up there and it has been a good day for everybody the they were putting us under pressure they reacted to a few difficult situations cardiff have worked hard and there are no easy games
twenty two teams this season
mack you have taken
the trophy since nineteen ninety five mack and david james congratulations what emotions are you experiencing
you have to defend for your lives
we have done that with every game in this campaign we have been good
a word about your manager
he is a legend in out he is a legend at the now now
portsmouth have won all twenty two games this season in which they scored first david james head two big disappointments in the f. a. cup finals but he is a win at today david james had a he is a winner today
we must give credit to cardiff city who have come and played very well here today they could not get the chance to score
kanu has a massive smile on his face how do you feel
good happy i have to thank my family my wife and my two children that is
i would say yes because i did not play a lot but i have played the semi finals i brought the team to the finals and i did it again this is the best moment of my life
what do these people mean
whenever there are
goal in the semi final and the winning goal in the final sol campbell congratulations what are you experiencing
it is fantastic this is a brilliant day semi finals everything and we work hard and we had a look through the round as in the end we got the result cardiff played good football they had a couple of chances but the quality came through a in and
harry redknapp will go down in history
it is fantastic a major honour for him he has brought this team have to get that and praise goes out to him
he get the best out in new
yes he treat the players probably and i am pleased for him at
cardiff have done really well they played good football today but
they ran out of ideas about a l. l.
think everybody wanted harry
for and it johnson both of them were very good and johnson's this feels so good when you know you are going
it was a very good game of fall of chances full of good play and it has been a fantastic day l. feel like the atmosphere is back in this final
the supporters did themselves proud just under ninety thousand here sol campbell had f. a. cup winning experience with arsenal he will collect the trophy for portsmouth what a moment for sol campbell particularly to receive it from the manager who won it here thirty years ago bobby robson never have the pompey chimes been heard louder in recent years david james and sylvain distin they brought experienced of portsmouth they brought experienced to portsmouth experience mendez did a good job were the winners
i think so on the daythey were nervous at first and cardiff were the better team up until kanu scored the better team at but goals change games hull city
your team and did you proud david jones we gave it everything we had and that is all you can ask we did everybody crowd whatever your nationality whatever we did what we did prove to other teams can choice of what can achieve what you do not think is possible
it has been a great occasion
i am very proud of my players not of everything going on at the supporters were magnificent and i am sorry we could not see it through for them
it looked like he might get an equaliser
it was always a tight game we had a good chance in the first half there is no one to blame we have had a fantastic day but it is hard when you lose
this could be the springboard for cardiff to go on to greater things
it has to be and we have struggled for three years no money for two years we have a new stadium it new training facilities the next stage is to compete with
have not and then that they score and your heart sinks but you pick yourself up and for a championship club to come here and give portsmouth a fright there are the ones who are changing and holding on that and holding on it we must have been doing something right this year
it is a tough one to deal with that goal it was in the air as well just dropping down l. should have done better but it is one of those things our defence could have cleared it but he got in front of me and tucked it in
could you have punched it away
i don't know maybe i could have tried to catch it but at the end of the day i didn't deal with it well enough and
defend at one to zero maybe we could have got the equaliser and we had a chance in the first half but it wasn't to be today
how special has it been this whole story
jonathan i have never had so many interviews it is time to some this game up the second to the game to be played at the rebuilt wembley it is portsmouth's day here so portsmouth have won the f. a. cup i don't wish to alarm you but the last time that happened world war the second broke out whatever happens portsmouth will be invading europe next season for the first time in their history the supporters will stay in wembley for as long as they can and so will the players enjoying what is always a very special moment indeed do you think they deserve it overall
in the second half they were terrific commiserations to cardiff in ten minutes' time their dressing room will be the loneliest place in the world but they will wake up with a certain degree of pride because they acquitted themselves so well but when we talk about experience distin and campbell had a torrid time in the first half but were magnificent they were the difference between portsmouth and cardiff in the second half it was a great second half and cardiff had their moments
cardiff lost a lot of questions of portsmouth in the first half l. don't think they ask any in the second half which was a shame portsmouth did what they had to do they got their goal in the first half from a mistake and they sat on that defended very well and whatever cardiff came up with portsmouth have the answers they deserve it went a competition a team that drew the competition and only conceded one goal they deserve it
a special moment for harry redknapp he has been through turmoil in recent weeks
off the pitch it has not been the greatest time he has got his reward today he has had an outstanding season as i said he has brought portsmouth back into being a big club now they are in europe they can go on from that they have a great set of players and coaches and they deserve it cardiff will wake up tomorrow disappointed but ultimately in a week's time they can look back and they run and be proud of themselves
they are going to their own crowd in the knowledge that they have won the f. a. cup final it is one of the best moments they could have it
a new look at the team that harry redknapp brought in james three kanu three distin freed it is amazing it is amazing and sol campbell says he has an act of getting the best out of his players by giving them time off saying but there you go you do it and i will look after you
the two centre backs were part in the first half they were good in the second half and that is why cardiff did not get any more chances poor
one goal which fell
to kanu it was it was unfortunate for anchormen enckelman it was good played down the right hand side the ball in old money is very difficult to defend against good play whether he should punch it it is difficult kanu is quick to react and it is in the back of the neck and then they are in big trouble
watch this space in front of the goalkeeper behind this and a half really difficult to defend against
you have got to give some credit to kanu because he missed a sitter before that and it would have been easy for him to hide but he is in the right place at the right time and he has made up for it
it for himself
it was a nice ball in but his first touch was exquisite with the outside of the boot he turns the defender he does the difficult thing by turning and going round the goalkeeper he has got an open goal watch his arm he thinks it is up he is a class player at times when he picked it up and makes a bit of movement and goes past people he does so with considered ease
after a brilliant bit of play from portsmouth probably the most outstanding attack of the game
this is terrific the way they have played
what a touch this is
the two at centre back took a great positions in the second half as i say after coming off at half time having had a real torrid time the two of them use their experience and got in the vital experience and position and led never left much space behind
they are isolated themselves on their own but in the second half they were very rarely apart
perhaps your mate had a word at half time
i can't say
we talk about enckelman making a mistake james makes a mistake it is a fantastic finish the referee is spot on there
it is handball he put his hand up but what a finish
it was his hand that pushed it up
glenn loovens went close in the second half
this was the only chance in the second half a good ball in he gets away from hermann hreidarsson and get in the right position at the right time and he gets in the right position
a great challenge at the end of the match the game at at the end of the game and he gets across quickly
think they are a really good team they played well today if you can get a few players in you can go for promotion
a ten million up for ramsey ten million for ramsey paul parry was a threat in the first half
when you get chances like cardiff it you have to take them you have to give them credit because they did get in there you have to take them he gave sol campbell a difficult time a good save by david james
and that is a great free kick
look how much space he has got
and this we have said he gets in a great position he looks up and it is a bit harsh
when he looks up he does not seem to many options the only option is to have a go at goal
it is hard to
plenty of coverage no england or home nations but plenty of premier league talent euro two thousand eight scoring an absolutely wonderful goal how about that for a goal brilliant finish magnificent just magnificent it promises a lot a lot of premier league players on display pick a team and make the most of it it was portsmouth's day
it has been a very good competition culminating in a good final commiserations to cardiff but they have acquitted themselves well and what a fantastic day for harry redknapp where were portsmouth when they too when he took over and where are they now
cardiff can be really proud of themselves but it was portsmouth's day and season and harry redknapp has done a magnificent job he thoroughly deserves it
behind as well great
london's an awesome place to be and that's why we're here
we've got a good little dysfunctional family group going on
could two thousand eight be the year that we make it big the year i'm louis musician and ex m. t. v. presenter
bad boy
i'm lucky enough to have a really talented group of mates with big ambitions for two thousand eight that's our aspiring actor daryl he's an east end boxer pretty boy model and quite possibly the most handsome man you'll ever meet
yeah i could be the next james bond maybe
this little minx is portia she's a model as well and according to the papers she's going to be the next kate moss and was even once linked to pete doherty
boys this year are not going to be number one priority it's gonna be me and my job
wicked
kesh is our street fashion designer the clothes she makes have been worn by kanye west and mariah carey
maybe one day when i'm like sitting on a stack of cash i can say yes i've made it
then there's my best friends model daisy lowe and singer will they're total jokers and are head over heels in lo o. ove will's well known on the london scene and is the front man of rock band blondelle
will is my first love and my only love and my boyfriend and my other best friend apart from louis
daisy's already a top british model london socialite look behind you and all round sexy lady over the next eight weeks you're gonna watch us try and make a living doing the things we love
i'm in love with my look
it's not going to be easy
i can't when i'm in this outfit
he can off
but can we get it together
i can't get her in man i've missed it i just want my mummy here
and stay together
can you trust me
on the rocky road to success
yeah i reckon two thousand eight is my career year
living with boys is a bad idea it's just a really really bad idea
nothing to do with me all to do with will
it was disgusting there were old doughnuts from three weeks ago it's was so so gross
but things are about to change daisy has already established herself as a top british model
i was modelling during school and was just like you know what i'm gonna go off and leave school and i'm gonna do this because this is my calling right now
having modelled for big names like chanel and agent provocateur she's now set her sites on becoming an international supermodel
i'm gonna move to new york for six months or maybe more maybe less who knows but hopefully a while for fashion new york is the fashion capital of the world it's got kind of sixty per cent of all the fashion work that there is in the world it's what i've been needing to do for a while i've been holding it off because i've been in love with my boyfriend
daisy and will have been inseparable since meeting at one of his gigs two years ago
it's really just been a case of us having to sacrifice our relationship so that she can work harder at becoming a supermodel and i can concentrate on my first love which is writing songs
aah morning has bro ken
la la la la la la la la la la la yo what's the deal ain't nothing
so we're all going to miss daisy but at least it's an excuse for one hell of a party before she goes
ooh ooh ee
all of our friends are just so close knit so to suddenly just not have them is really horrible my family and my friends are so important in my life
and hers is no ordinary family she comes from rock 'n roll royalty that's her mum nineties rocker pearl lowe
when i was younger cos we grew up together cos i was so young when i had her she would organise me i mean if we went on holiday she'd have the passports she'd have the tickets she'd say mummy i don't trust you this was when she was about seven
and that's her stepdad danny goffey from supergrass
moving to new york you know that's quite a mad thing for an eighteen nineteen year old to do to kind of move on her own which i think it's gonna be great for her you know um but yeah she's my little girl
danny goes off and plays in a band and i go and design and she goes and models but you know that's the thing
our family dynamic is as crazy as any other family dynamic yeah but we are young
she is one of the most warm hearted people i've ever met in my life and it's really sad that we have to part i'm truly broken hearted about the fact that she has to leave
honestly i don't know what i'm gonna do without her i can't take care of myself i'm a complete idiot like daisy did my washing she did the washing up i dunno how i'm gonna live in that flat without daisy being there
i think she's gonna do amazingly in new york she's gonna earn her name over there and you know she's gonna rock it over there i speak to her every single day and she comes down most weekends she's my best mate so it's gonna be really horrible without her
cheers cheers oh
tingle
aww i don't like this goodbye crap
daisy and will breaking up for the sake of their careers has got us all thinking none more so than portia she's trying to boost her modelling career after putting a relationship first for the past year
i fell in love and for two years i kind of hid i didn't really want to i didn't want to be away from him i wanted to be with him the whole time
unfortunately like most of my relationships portia's didn't last
it's so good to see you and you
unlike most models portia's career started at the top since being spotted at clothes show live when she was fifteen she's appeared in all the top fashion magazines her first being vogue
it was this isn't true this is a dream you're really really proud inside and you want to burst and tell the whole world
with boys out of her mind portia's now focusing on her career
i've actually got the passion back inside of me to succeed in what i do like any job if you think you believe in yourself and the people who care about you around you believe in you you can get anywhere you want to be and i've got that sort of support from my loved ones and i'm gonna get there
i'm living with this one and i'm living with that one they go by the name of tweedledee and tweedledum sacrificing my relationship with daisy for being in a band has made me so much more hungry because i don't want to have thrown away a perfectly great existence for nothing
blondelle have been together since they were fourteen singer will grew up next to lead guitarist sam whose cousin rory plays bass finally my local barman mike he pulls pints and plays drums well you gotta pay the bills somehow eh
and i wonder
now blondelle aren't just any old up and coming band you'd remember them from this top ten hit well if you'd ever lived in japan
i do feel like it's make or break for the band now we have to produce the best songs ever with the most integrity and play them with a vengeance when we do gigs um if not we should just pack up and all go our separate ways now but that's not what we wanna do i'm currently sharing a bed with sam sam and rory say hello we're like best friends i don't know anybody in the world as well as i know those guys so we're kind of like brothers and this is where rory and mike stay it's quite cute isn't it and this is the pole the obligatory strip pole any self respecting band member has to have a strip pole and this is where sam and i share a bed
is there no limit to the sacrifices this band will make
i think it's been really hard on both will and daisy
yeah since she moved away to new york
i mean imagine your girlfriend moves three thousand miles away how would you feel i dunno it's pretty i think he hides it quite well i'm just really happy to be here cos it is such an amazing city i mean in the short two weeks that i've been here i've done quite a lot of soul searching which has been really good oh so welcome to my apartment these shoes me and will have matching ones and we're only allowed to wear them when the other one's wearing them i don't know if the rule still applies but it should do cos i haven't worn them and then this is my fridge which basically just consists of cupcakes peanut butter hummus grapes water and juice this is my bedroom and i just really love it cos i think just really weird um but i do i just love this place i love this room and i've put up all my different pictures of like nebulas and hydrogen gas cylinders that um act as cocoons with stars there's a photo of venus
daisy i think you might have been spending a little too much time alone
um that is jupiter
whilst her apartment might be out of this world it's still not quite home
that really cute one of will i love that picture i'm still getting used to the fact that i have to sleep on my own without will cuddling me it is scary cos like i'm a single girl in new york and i'm on my own and what if someone broke in i'd be totally helpless i miss and louis so much um i just wanna give both of them a really big cuddle and it's weird being without them i hate being without them
i miss living with you too daise
at least will doesn't have to cope alone he's got the company of his band mates
living together all under the same roof is productive for us if we haven't been writing we've been rehearsing stuff we've just written
guitar intro
we're working harder than ever
after all this hard graft there's got to be some pretty crazy rock'n'roll nights
this isn't peri peri this is jerk but it's not gonna work there's too much liquid in there
come on the broccoli's gonna get cold
living in this house is different i don't have my girlfriend and i don't have louis rest it on this it's dripping all over the gaff every now and again it does get hard at the same time i can't complain i'm living with my three best friends and we're all doing you know what we love doing it's good chicken
a hearty meal who put barbecue sauce on the table you heathens
bohemian like you by the dandy warhols
i dropped out of school a while ago i was a hairdresser for six months an assistant hairdresser i was awful at it really lazy and then i got that job at m. t. v. when i was a presenter i was getting paid a lot of money and i was like cool i felt like a bit of a mug really cos it was really what i wanted to do so now i make no money but i'm doing what i like i can't imagine er a job you know musician or d. j. anything more fun it's absolutely perfect it does worry me a little bit that i might get left behind um cos i haven't truly accomplished anything i've really wanted i really want to do yet i think i mean i've done some pretty cool stuff but um no i don't think i'm proud of myself yet it's now two o'clock and i've finished djing er i'm knackered but i've got paid i'm not the only one doing crazy hours portia's back in london working and determined two thousand eight is gonna be her year
i do love my job now i'm back in to it working every day kind of thing i realised i you know need to pull up my socks cos it doesn't wait for you if you wanna have a career in this industry i'm gonna nag nag nag nag all my agencies so if i'm staying in one city for too long i'm gonna go i haven't been to this city for a while maybe go back to new york go to milan i really need to get back into the swing of it i'm definitely ready for two thousand eight to be my year of workaholic ing it that doesn't even make sense i'm a model
in new york somebody's had an early morning call
i'm so tired
it's so early new york fashion week's probably the biggest deal it's the most influential of all the fashion weeks whatever girls are booked for the shows they do really well in all the other fashion weeks it's gonna consist of hair and make up lots of faffing around and me doing a walk which i think is kind of ridiculous i've been doing it since i was two it should be all right but yeah i get really nervous i didn't flash my underwear did i a normal teenager gets lonely i get lonely a normal teenager gets tired i get tired normal teenagers cry over heartbreaks i do that too however because most normal teenagers don't have to fly around the world as much as i do i'm a lucky one
this is america's largest fashion event and a platform for some of the world's top models
excuse me so these are my shoes and i was given them today they're too big for me which is kind of scary i feel a little bit sick i just want it to start now
and after a practice walk for the designer yes a practice walk
i miss home enough as it is but yeah not having anyone that i really know here is making it a bit harder i can't just sit around having chats with loads of friendly faces but it's a new experience and obviously it means that i'll make loads of new friends here which is quite nice um yeah it's also sad it makes me miss home a lot i just want my mummy here i'm such a mummy's girl
now's not the time to get homesick daise there are hundreds of fashion luvvies waiting to judge you
uptown downtown turn the beat around town hip hoppin' beat boppin' there's no stoppin' to the sound of the new york city

oh yeah
this is sweet welcome to the show
looking at the women and having
what's going on
ah unbelievable i'm so excited
about seeing madonna madonna madonna madonna madonna it's non stop
we've only got four minutes to save the world
i have loads of guy mates i would never dream of doing anything with them they're like my brothers
no they ain't
go ahead
no they're not her best guy mate are you not going out with him now
hello and welcome i'm jeff leach and this is surgery the show that knows who its friends are sit yourselves down relax so today we're talking about friendships and asking that age old question can guys and girls ever really just be friends or at some point does sex always come into it what do you think yes no mixed views there so guys and girls just friends is it actually possible i sent out our afro dizzy double act to kiss the uncertainty good bye
hi i'm poppy and i'm kat we're in two minds as to whether girls and guys can be friends i think they can have a platonic relationship without fancying each other i have loads of guy friends and there's no hidden agenda
maybe but call me a cynic i think it's really hard to maintain those relationships once one person has fallen for the other here's what you thought can guys and girls be mates
yep if you share the same interests and that and not fancy each other you can be as good friends with the opposite sex
no maybe no what do you reckon
no end of
why not temptation obviously it's sex
it's easier to get along with guys than it is to get along with girls
even though you don't fancy each other somewhat you'd want to impress them
i have a lot of boy friends boys that are friends yeah i know
not to be shallow but if a girl isn't particularly good looking then you don't want to be all right i don't want to know her just cos she's not attractive to you
i like flirting having a bit of fun
do you reckon you flirt even in purely platonic like friendships with girls
i think most guys wanna know that girls like them even if they don't like them they want to flirt with them to get them to like them just so that you'll be able to say she likes me
so have you ever been in a friendship and then realised that you are actually falling for him yeah
well i didn't want to ruin the friendship
a friend told him that i liked him and then he stopped talking to me
oh no
there's the good old one where you fancy someone you start off being friends but it always blossoms into something more
that's what you want that's when it gets more difficult
or you get totally denied
so what do we reckon guys and girls can people ever be friends without it going further what do you think laura no way definitely
i don't think they can have a platonic relationship without one getting feelings for the other or one of them wanting more from the relationship
so it's not possible to just be friends
no no you disagree with that
no are you agreeing no of course i agree there's always a boy is always attracted to a girl they don't just start talking to a girl they don't like
carry on explain that
if they do it's cos they are attracted if not by looks then personality you like the same things so you start talking you're attracted wait i'm talking
wait he's talking
better let him finish now go ahead
you are attracted to each other whether it be personality or looks and you start talking then the boy doesn't want to be friends he's just being friends so you'll progress to become a girlfriend
so you think it's just the start of some sort of sexual thing
start yeah
you don't agree
no i don't agree at all what do you think sheila i think that you can just be friends it doesn't matter if you're a boy or a girl
have you got plenty of friendships with guys yeah i do and it's platonic
yeah i would never dream of doing anything with them they're like brothers
no they're not
no
ooh been dropped in it dropped in it is that right can i say something of course my sweet
we've got a good point well made
listen to me i'll argue my point i started going out with him it's one guy people do have relationships every other guy that i'm mates with i'd never dream of it
no there was an attraction
if it happened once it could happen again let me come over to you my friends let me jump in here
it depends on that person's personality because i for one don't look at looks but
you don't believe him
so i would be attracted by her personality and the experiences that we have been through since childhood i like
awwwwww do you believe what he's saying
he's got a point but i think it depends on the person if you have a childhood friend a girl if i got attracted to her i'd feel a bit weird
sorry but girls do have feelings as well and girls do also want things as well
yeah but you know what i'm saying
no excuse me what is an area that you can't just say that boys always want something else because females as well do have senses
they have desires they have wants and needs let me come over to this side lady with her hand up
well i was gonna say i think that what everyone else has been saying is a bit rubbish cos you can actually be friends innit me and my best friend we went to the same school we aren't sexually attracted
have you got a boyfriend as well
yeah he's next to me
which one that's my boyfriend so this is them both
and we're just friends we've got the same interests we like the same things but there's no sexual
your trainers are different you're lying lies no no no we both
what are you saying are you two friends that's my best mate you two were boys before no no
we were friends first not even that
i knew her before they got together
is he jealous of you two being so close are you
no no not at all
no problems i trust them
every now and again i do wish she'd come to me with some problems relationship issues but apart from that i don't mind
so she goes to him with problems rather than to you
yeah some relationship problems
and how does that make you feel like she doesn't trust you
it does annoy me sometimes but at the end of the day
a love triangle go ahead go ahead so coming over to you hang on a second guys wait one second so what do you think you don't think that's a platonic friendship
i'm not saying that i am not saying that
whoa whoa all right all right no no
he's my friend platonic
good for you but if a guy
breathe
she's jarring me
breathe deep go ahead
maybe not for you but for guys it's worse i'm not getting involved in your relationship but it's so obvious i see you looking at her
he's checking her out
so you're saying you've sat next to me you've seen me
it's the body language and you've seen me
guys all right guys hang on a sec how does their friendship make you feel do you trust her implicitly with nathan
yeah i do i trust them both and we live in the same area
what so you can honestly say that you've never felt sexually attracted to your mate nothing never ever
hang on a sec
never ever ever ever
go ahead
you two can be friends like and share stuff with each other but at the end of the day it's got to go to a certain level cos this is my good girl friend here but still
let's clarify friends yeah
yeah i've a girlfriend which i love
you're always doing that
nah listen she has boyfriends yeah and she can talk to them but she has to come to me first about the problems no no no yeah yeah
he gets upset when she goes to his boy friends same way she doesn't know i'm even here with him
revelation
that's what he said that's what he said
all right hang on a sec go ahead
my girlfriend does know she's here really lies she does now lies she does yeah also i admit it shouldn't go on like that it shouldn't it shouldn't do you have feelings then no she's my friend man i love her like my sister
but you said it has to go to a certain level like in this case you're saying that they're possibly not just friends are you the same
you feel like it's like brother and sister innit i understand but i've got to show my girlfriend more affection than i show my friend
but are you do you feel she shows you more affection
but still yeah you've gotta tell him stuff or he'll feel left out
let's ask the reason why do tell nathan certain things that you feel you can't talk to your boyfriend about
cos there's certain problems that i don't know whether i'm being paranoid or whether it's actually a problem nathan will highlight it to me from a male perspective tell me whether i'm exaggerating or whether it is actually a problem cos often he'll say no he doesn't think that he's just chilling back playing playstation and you are stressing out here for nothing you know where's alex
a little bit a little bit
who're the mates you snogged both of them
it's not nasty how is that nasty
but these two boys yeah they go to my college right
and you're all mates yeah we're all part of the same group of mates
it's not a love triangle there's no relationships we're just friends when you go out you have a snog that is it
hang on a sec guys let's hear her out
that's it yeah sam is my best friend so is lee i can tell sam anything he's got a girlfriend now but so you don't snog anymore no not any more
who sets that line
no good question what do you think about it
i think if you like someone go for it if you don't no
you agree i
well we've got lots of different ideas lots of different thoughts hang on ladies and gentlemen so whether you started off as mates then became dates or you skipped mate and went straight for date and you're trying at young love can it last the distance is the person you'll spend your life with really gonna be someone you met in your teens can teen romance last no yes argh well poppy and kat went to find out just that
when i fall in love it'll be forever sigh
funny anyway we're in bristol talking about all things cupid and whether teen romance can actually last
i think you can be eight and fall in love but not forever i think you can find the one now if you want
no way i think i'm much too young
maybe later on in life like when i'm fifty
engaged not married
what's the point of that
i won't pay out for a marriage
if you can find the right person from such a young age and be able to stay with them for a very very long time then i think something can last
i've got mates in relationships but i don't think it can last they'll go down town and temptation will take over do you think that you can properly love someone at your age or do you think it's just lust
if you're friends with someone then you fall in love then you can properly love them
probably lust but then if you're with then for a year or something it could become love then
it's about the strength of the bond
it's just fun innit something better to do i think if you were really truly in love and you could last forever then yeah i think you could do it
so ladies and gentlemen can teen romance last what do you think sophie
i think it can cos me and tim have been together for nine months now and i can't see myself being without him
hang on a sec
i think it can because me and my boyfriend we've been together for two years and we live together and i'm eighteen and he's nineteen and we live together a commitment which is a step further than most people our age are at
hang on a second i'll come to you with the microphone my love go don't you think that you're too young for all of that stuff how old are you you're saying you're too young at this age
yeah why are you settled down now there's years to do that have fun
hang on a sec we'll go back to the couple hang on hang on a sec guys tim have you had relationships before this
yeah i'll admit i've been a bit of a player i've scouted i've done what i want yeah
all right hang on
that wasn't the path that i wanted to take you know i wanted a girl i could go back to and someone i could turn to
be committed to her
when i was going out checking next girl each week she wasn't there the day after if i met a girl i really liked and it would just be a one night stand and i'd wonder why not be with someone you love
so because you've had that experience of playing the field a little beforehand now you're ready to commit to her
experience what you've started dating when you were sixteen fourteen maybe two years and then a long relationship
just come up here go ahead mate
i'd say that everything we do is related to
hang on guys go ahead
everything you do is related to attraction to someone else someone you think's nice at the time
do you think teen romances can last though no i dunno
i think it's definitely more lust than anything else
can i ask sophie tim's had this experience before you hooked up have you done the same thing no you haven't so is this your first proper relationship yeah
aww that's lovely
i mean are you worried everyone's gonna have a big hug at the end are you worried about tim and his history then does that make you worry at all that he might play around in future
sometimes it does or attracted to other girls
cos he's still quite young he's got girls that are friends
but i think i can trust him it's just you think you can yeah i can trust him
you can yeah let me just come up to this young lady go ahead i don't want a laugh i want a comment
to have proper serious relationships because wait i haven't finished yet if i met someone right now yeah and they were all i'm not doing to go to uni i don't want no degree i'm not going to get no proper job i'm not on that i wanna meet someone no no no no no no no wait wait wait wait i'm on yeah someone that has ambition i need someone that's making money i ain't no handout i ain't no handout cos when he's in my house saying he wants me to pay the bills babe i'll pay you next week no you won't be getting my money you won't no because i don't need no man i don't need no man saying yeah babe can you just lend me ten
but your missing out on things a teenager should be doing
and what are those things
my sister's seventeen she's been with her boyfriend budge up
wanna sit on my lap it's not that show
for two years and they've just had a baby and she doesn't feel like she's missing out she is happy
guys you didn't hear the end of that wait one second you did miss out on the end of that
she doesn't feel like she's missing out at all she's happy it's what she wants
that's what she wants
she hasn't had time to experience anything else she hasn't had the time so she doesn't know what
guys don't talk over each other for a sec go ahead respond to that
she's not the type to go out clubbing
i think teenage relationships can last because i know people who are in their thirties and they met when they were fourteen and they're still together but there's two different sides to it because one couple that i know are really happy and the other one she's like i regret it i love him but there's other stuff i wanted to do with my life he didn't hold me back but i couldn't do all i wanted to do because of the relationship
we'll come to you buddy can teen relationships can last i dunno
it's all lust and infatuation that's all it is
go ahead
it never lasts
you don't know it never lasts
well sometimes it does but that's only a few times
it can you think it can my parents have been together since they were seventeen and are still happy aww
so a case in point it can happen
it depends on the people if people at seventeen want to get together and stay together then it's their choice to do that if you want to experience more get married later in life then you can do that
shall we just do it now no
no we haven't crossed the boundaries
he's fully gay like ow gay
i got called a gold digger by the way which i disagree with
yeah we kiss and everything yeah just a bit of harmless fun we loved it it was wicked
no you haven't i have no you have not i have
if you've been affected by anything in this programme please call on or visit the surgery website
only you can make this world seem bright
we got company
only
some things
junior
that's how it seems if you read the papers go online
but is that really your life surely it's just the actions of a few affecting the way everyone else thinks about you what's really going on
are you worse than your parents' generation
revealed is here to find out why do they hate you i'm anthony i'm charlotte we're both journalists
and this is the first programme we've presented together it's called revealed
we're not like other news programmes that talk about you but not to you we want to hear your stories
and look at the headlines from a different point of view
enough chat here's what's coming up
we're not accusing any of them of anything they're in the area they're a group of young people
what would you normally do on a friday night
get drunk get drunk
people think we're bad because we've got hoods but i ain't that bad i'm a nice lad
been arrested before nope how about you yeah
there are problems with violent crime in some areas inevitably that's what the media picks up on
it's quite unfair to blame it all on young people
teenagers in the u. k. are more hated than anywhere else in europe and there's research out there to prove it more than fifteen million british adults said they thought about moving house just go get away from you hanging around in their area
just hanging around not trying to break in or smash up the bus stop just spending time outside with your mates that's not to say there aren't some of you who are up to no good
most people have quite a negative attitude towards teenagers they have the view that we're all going to cause trouble
clare's seventeen and lives near belfast
she told us about a place where she used to hang out
so this is the park
this is the park we spent most of our summer in for the past few years but we turned up one day last summer and there was a padlock on the gates why have they locked it up they decided that we weren't welcome basically they figured that we were causing trouble and drinking and being anti social and were you drinking no like twelve o'clock during the summer in the central town park i don't think even if we wanted to we could
were you ever a bit rowdy a bit too noisy maybe
not us we sunbathed all day it was good weather a group of twenty is quite a lot of people
could you see why someone walking through on their own might be intimidated by them
yeah i understand but i think it's unfair to blame it all on young people if it was a group of adults and a young person was walking through it would be the same but the adults wouldn't be asked to leave the owners of the park
said they had good reason to lock the gate torquay a small town on the south coast of england there's a nice little harbour you can send your granny a postcard and get some great fish and chips
but there can be a bit of trouble here on a friday night and sometimes it involves teenagers
we want to see if the calls the police get here are anything like headlines so i'm off for a night on the beat
while ant was getting soaked i was getting a ride in a police van with officers nikki and chris
last year i was out with my sergeant in a marked patrol car and we were being stoned by a group of thirty kids teenagers i suppose fifteen sixteen year olds we physically couldn't get out the car and they were running up and down a lane so no matter which way we drove they'd run the opposite way
that must have been frightening yeah unbelievable
do you ever get the feeling there's a party going on and you're the only one uninvited
blimey oh wow so busy
there's about fifty young people cheered as the police van arrived
what are you all doing down here just trying to have a good time
but yet again we can't you're being quite noisy we've had a few calls
there's a lot of young people down here more than about sixty everyone's quite rowdy
wa hey guys clear off sorry it's not funny it's not fair
after a good half an hour nikki and chris manage to move everyone on but they reckon this won't be the last we see of the party tonight
hello hi it's me hi charlotte
just got back from down by the beach about sixty teenagers down there sixty yeah absolutely loads that will explain why i'm sat here all on my own
my night started to liven up and i got to hear about the beach party why do you go down there cos there's nothing to do in torquay why do the police move you on i dunno what do you reckon people make of a massive group of teenagers i've heard there were sixty of you down there that's gonna scare some people they just think we're yobs
but when we leave as soon as we get to the top of the hill everyone just separates up people think we're bad cos we've got hoods but we ain't that bad i'm a nice lad this lot were a bit shy about being on camera
what would you normally do on a friday night get drunk is that it yeah why there's nothing else to do is there
on the other side of town a call came in
someone's been assaulted up the road why have you made them stand there because the man who's been assaulted was assaulted by a large group of young people we're not accusing any of these guys at this point but they're a group of young people in the area
back at the station it was time to ask nikki and chris about what we'd seen that night
the few that we deal with it's tiring it's hard work when you're being fought against all the time
the fear of crime is so much bigger than the reality of crime committed it's the same with binge drinking everyone really does go out and binge drink there's a town full of adults down there getting lashed but no one's really writing about them cos they're doing it in a pub or a club the kids are on the beach at the start of the night we spoke to a group of young people at a bus stop
i wanted to know if they'd have done the same thing if it was a group of adults'
it all depends
nikki later told us that two seventeen year olds were arrested that night
it's been a cold wet night i've booked a taxi and i'm going back to the hotel
eight hours later back on a beach but this time to throw some stones and have a quick catch up nikki and chris pulled this one group over and it was perfectly clear that most of them had definitely not been involved in a fight they weren't pumped up and excited like you would be after a fight and i really got the feeling from them that they were quite annoyed at having been pulled over again by the police and they're like every time we're out past ten o'clock with more than three friends we get pulled over did you ever feel threatened by the teenagers you spoke to
not at all there was three lads and they felt it was so unfair cos they'd gone to the beach to get away from the areas where they'd be disturbing people they'd gone there cos they knew there'd be nobody around
torquay was only one night in one town but what about the bigger picture working out how bad youth crime is
isn't easy so we're going to speak to someone who can make sense of it the amount of crime here is almost twice the national average welcome to middlesbrough doctor mark simpson may have some answers
he's a crime expert who works here at the university of teeside
so when it comes to crime and teenagers are things worse than before
maybe not in terms of the statistics they show that crime is falling quite substantially over the last ten years certainly that's the case with young people
but in this newspaper a typical headline is youth crime shoots up by two thirds in ten years that suggests the opposite of what you just said
yes we like to read about these things there is an element of truth of course if you look at statistics across the board the british crime survey for example that suggests that violent crime is stable there are significant problems with violent crime in some areas and that's what the media picks up on you can always throughout history talk about a golden era and it's always twenty years ago things were better
even mark says the figures are complicated but the overall message is that crime is down but people think that there's more of it going on than there actually is in england and wales
so what about the other ninety seven per cent of you or to put it the other way the other forty five million of you who aren't getting into trouble
just hanging about really going to town or the beach there's not much to do round here we're on our council estates all day just sitting there
and by people in their houses because we're sitting there
i've got a lot of spare time on my hands cos i've got exams coming up
shopping horse riding going out with friends
chloe and emma love shopping bags clothes jewellery and they're putting their passion for fashion to good use tell me what you're doing at the moment
we're organising a charity fashion show this summer
what does that involve
it involves picking up people for modelling and asking local businesses to get involved
some might say that's quite selfish motives i suppose it is
cos it will help you in your career but it's also raising money for local charities so it can't be selfish if it leads to something good
volunteering doesn't necessarily mean raising cash for charity joe's sixteen and life's all about football when he's not playing it he coaches it he's been helping out at ross juniors for over a year before the coaching what sort of thing would you get up to
mainly playstation or watching the telly not much mainly boring but since i've been doing this it's a lot more fun why did you fancy doing it because i like the boys winning matches
when they win do you feel proud for them
if i see them do something which we trained on it feels good cos you know that you had part to do with it i feel proud cos i've done something to help
belfast middlesbrough preston torquay ross on wye it's been a long journey it certainly has
when we set out we wanted to challenge the image of teenagers in the headlines are you that bad
the crime figures suggest not but it goes further than that you are more likely than any other age group in the u. k. to do volunteer work
you're ten times more likely to be a volunteer than a criminal but that's not such a good headline for a look at what's coming up next week check out the website

field medicine you know real florence nightingale stuff
boobies boobies boobies it's friday night
obviously it's very difficult to know exactly how they're feeling but it's probably headachey achey joints just not having any energy not drinking as much feverish but interestingly not all of them get a fever when they get malaria but you can see that all these are relative that's classic oh now that was close we don't bite there um excuse me i was actually talking to the camera at that particular look d. d. do you mind somehow i think this one's beginning to feel a bit better
that from orangutan diary which presumably reads woke up had banana then spoiled michaela's piece to camera on to slightly less exotic animals but no less skilled at drawing attention to themselves
patrick burns is just outside that farm near alvechurch right now so patrick what's the latest then
suzanne having been left so long pretty much fending for themselves these unfortunate animals have becomes increasingly aggressive they're no longer particularly used to human contact

now over to reporter mike liggins from look east he's out on the golf course judging by this possibly for the first time
see the thing about golf is that it's actually quite a hard game to play even when the ball is stock still oh
the reason mike liggins is out there is because he's been shown a trick shot this is him attempting it
just to show you how easy that is i'm going to have a go myself metallic tap oh
but undaunted and never embarrassed by his own behaviour mike moved on to working with animals
i'm not sure it was the hedgehog that needed rescuing still if you think he's in trouble let's pay a visit to the weird world of bill turnbull
that's why bill's attractive because he's emotionally articulate he can actually communicate and women do find that very very very attractive
we'll leave it there we'll leave it there thank you very much aw the programme's not quite over darling later thank you lovely to see you
the air is going into your head you do look like a jazz trumpet player oh you've given yourself a nosebleed man you've actually injured yourself on television let's take a look at what's coming up later in the programme adoption on that adoption issue on television last night what did she have to say our entertainment reporter is here sorry for twitching

oh i wouldn't like that peter i'd miss you very much and you'd miss me too
or as bill turnbull would go and before we leave let's pay one last visit to gameshow land and graham norton's the big finish if you've ever been on a quiz show however much your brain leaves your body rest assured you will never ever ever have done as badly as big brother's nikki grahame

good evening sir
don't sit in my chair when i'm not here wilson
sorry sir i was just writing out a notice
that's neither here nor there don't sit at my desk what am i supposed to lean on use your initiative and write on your knee did i give you permission to sit sorry sir you are a soldier
who says so the colonel it's here somewhere the visit is confirmed
a home guard unit is to provide a guard of honour at the town hall
i hope they don't pick us don't they realise we're front line troops anyway i was never very keen on the french
they're very good soldiers only up to a point
they're not much good after lunch oh really wine and garlic are very debilitating all they do is chase women come with me to the casbah they are rather emotional sir they go in for sloppy kissing they even kiss at medal ceremonies
if you were picked as guard commander you'd get one a medal no a kiss i wouldn't stand for any of that sort of thing
come in
capt mainwaring there is a lady outside who wishes an audience when i say a lady i don't mean she's a woman although of course she is a woman she rejoices under the name of lady maltby what does she want she didn't give me any confidence lords and ladies seldom do when we were in the sudan lord kitchener never gave any of us any confidence show her in
fasten your collar up right sir
her ladyship the lady maltby
this is indeed an honour i'm captain mainwaring i've heard of you this is my sergeant he's just going
arthur how nice to see you my dear angela you look
my goodness me you look absolutely marvellous it really is good to see you
she's certainly got confidence in mr. wilson they've met before
i seem to know your face
i've been purveying meat to your establishment since his lordship fell out with sainsbury's
of course you're mr. jones they'll be one book extra this week my son is home on leave
i've got some nice chops talk it over with the cook i'm sure we can get our heads together you rely on me jones that'll do thank you sir
arthur it is nice to see you again yes of course it is so nigel's coming home
how is he he got married did he really of course he did auntie lettice told me
and now he's in the blues is he really my grandfather was in the blues
he was in the khyber pass lady maltby hasn't come here to talk to you
forgive us but it's ages since arthur and i had a chinwag
do sit down actually i came here about my car
yes i can't get any petrol for it
i thought somebody ought to use it towards the war effort i'll have it back when we've won
what sort of car is it
oh just an ordinary sort of rolls
oh
would the home guard or the wardens put it to best use the home guard i'm so glad you think that mr. hodges is awfully common of course i know mr. jones and arthur is such a darling i'm sure you're very nice too
yes we'd look after it most carefully my men are very reliable they are all hand picked
hey they're all lined up out here waiting and if you don't come soon we're all off home i thought you'd like to know
rough diamond that one just the chap to have on your side in a scrap
what would you do with a rolls it would be my staff car but it's also shiny and rolls roycey camouflage it
there you are but wouldn't a huge great big rolls royce look silly how do you mean i suppose we could sit you on a cushion
sorry i'm late a horse went down the street so i brought you some for your roses get out
take it away
i'll leave it in the back
a new recruit we haven't licked him into shape
i'll ask glossop to drive it round on saturday morning
that's very generous you've been a brick angie pop round for a drink i'd love to
ask capt fanshawe mainwaring i shall be delighted thank you ask capt mainwaring to let you off delighted
see you soon yes goodbye she's awfully sweet don't you think
i think it's pathetic oh why why you kowtowing to her just because she's got a title i wasn't kowtowing it cuts no ice with me tell that to your auntie lettice
where is he you've done it how dare you barge in here you put her off giving me that car
we haven't put her off at all it's just that we know her socially
we're providing half the guard of honour for the french general i hope you're not providing the other half if you're going to be there i shall refuse to parade just watch it and mind your step if i see any light from this hall or if you leave your bicycle without immobilising it i'll have you
i haven't got a bicycle then you'd better immobilise your crutches
he's the most appalling fellow
he's no business to be chief warden the man's a greengrocer
so was lord maltby really in a big way i suppose yes it's not what or who you know it's how much of it you have we'll have no bolshie talk here
go and fall the men in
yes sir all right chaps fall in three nice tidy little rows come on quick as you can
stand at ease i'm proud to announce that we have an addition to our battle fleet it's a rolls royce staff car
can i drive it mr. mainwaring certainly not bags i first ride in it be quiet pike a rolls royce is very comfortable i went to a wedding once you gave the driver instructions through a speaking tube it wasn't my car
that'll do
they're reliable too sir lord kitchener had one in nineteen fourteen general french also had one when i say general french i don't mean he's a french general general french was an english general some find that confusing but i wasn't talking about him i was talking about kitchener he was getting worried about recruiting he thought he was going to run out of men he was getting into his rolls when he noticed the dashboard was all mingy he turned to his driver and said why is my dashboard so mingy well said the driver it's this foreign mahogany we need english wood we need yew that's it said the general that's the slogan your country needs you not many people know this story
stand your men at ease at ease you've been selected to provide the guard for the french general
an honour indeed sir you see the reward for being smart
yes another hour's cleaning take that welshman's name you have also been chosen because of the person who has to make the speech of course it has to be in french oh well i suppose i could practise your sergeant speaks french he's the obvious choice not that obvious
i've been asked by area to make this as smart as possible
it can hardly be smart with those wardens quite right we should provide the whole guard
yes the presence of the wardens will make it a bit of a shambles i'll have a word with the mayor you can provide the whole guard thank you and uncle arthur will make the french speech
mon general mon general nous autres a walmington on sea
hello home guard morning it's glossop here lady maltby's chauffeur hello i'm on my way to get the rolls camouflaged for capt mainwaring and i've run out of petrol where are you at the town hall you stay there and we'll come and push bye bye captain mainwaring's rolls royce is stuck we've got to push it
you can't push a great big thing like that you can mum's always saying you're muscular it's enormous if i get petrol could i drive it the chauffeur wouldn't let you
you could make him commandeer it don't be silly tell him we can't do anything i haven't got the number come on what about capt mainwaring i've left him a note come on
for heaven's sake why all the hurry frank come back here for a moment
uncle arthur it's mr. hodges' bike there'll be petrol in that frank that would be stealing you could commandeer it it's only mr. hodges' there's a tin here how will you get it from there into that you are silly
what do you mean we pour it in don't we
wilson
he's not here sir i saw him go off with pike they've left a note rolls broken down all gone to help
i don't see what help he can give them it should be at the paint shop jones take your van and a length of rope and tow them there right
come on i'll come there might be a story
traffic delays vital supplies have you no regard for the truth don't insult the press jones's deliveries are vital supplies that's the last drop can i drive it
don't be silly frank
can i ride in the back yes i'm sure glossop will drive us to the paint shop i'm glad you've come what's the matter the mace is dirty what do you expect me to do sam can clean it look lively this should have been done ages ago
come on lads get the rope out tie it on the front and we'll tow it round the paint shop
how much is mainwaring paying for this camouflage job eight pounds i have a spray gun at my workshop i use it on the hearse i'll do it for seven pounds it's only brown and green paint
jones the butcher it's ready to go
right you steer the other one
no sign of them yet sir
i can't think what's happened to them i wanted to give them a parade briefing keep looking out godfrey
i'm getting rather chilled sir one loses heat standing around
jump up and down a bit
your hooligans have pinched my petrol they poured it from my bike as if it was a teapot and they left it on its side
not my men what's this then petrol requisitioned f. pike the spelling's wrong
that proves it then you're not getting me off that parade i'm going to appeal to the home secretary we've got it mr. mainwaring don't get so excited i sat in the back and waved what are you going to do about this i'm going to inspect my new staff car stop pushing
look at that she should have given it to me isn't it magnificent look at that craftsmanship no french car can match that nor a yankee one it's an awfully good staff car i bet there isn't another one like this in the british isles what's that it's twins
look at that he's got another one typical mainwaring one on and one in the wash
where did you get this car outside the town hall where did that one come from
i'm sorry to bother you but the town clerk wants you the mayor has lost his rolls royce do you think the mayor will be cross with mr. mainwaring for putting paint all over his rolls royce it's like this mr. mainwaring i think it's been stolen i don't know what to do about it
have you informed the police no i haven't quite right you see i was the one who left the window open
i'm responsible for not immobilising it i don't want the police to get word of it i thought seeing how you have a lot of men you might send them out to look for it
yes i might be able to help thanks should i inform anyone else no leave this in my hands
you'll have to look sharp we need the car for the french general
it'll be there you idiot wilson i didn't touch the car you took lady maltby's with my petrol
if i could get a photo of the mayor when he sees his rolls i could have it in every paper in the country
jock can you spray it black again
what time is it twelve o'clock three hours i could try
good man for ten park it outside the town hall nobody will be any the wiser they will i'm going to split
sneak call me what you like unless we go on parade i'm going to tell the mayor
he's got us by the fuzzy wuzzies
yes very well hodges you can come on the parade
general kitchener used that saying because the fuzzy wuzzies have got short curly hair what he really meant was
yes yes all right
i'm only trying to make the war a bit more cheerful
i'm sorry about this but i can't get the flashbulbs
don't be too obtrusive righto boy are you going to say all that quite a lot of it is scratched out
i changed my mind a lot keep it short or it'll be boring i have to talk until the car comes
i'll take one of you and the general like you said good man righto boy
frazer's cutting it fine there he is look by jove what a magnificent job
just give me the nod your reverence he's coming places everybody

doctor how could i forget you but one must be sure with the unicorn on the loose
a unicorn brilliant where
the unicorn the jewel thief nobody knows who he is he's just struck again snatched lady babbington's pearls right from under her nose
funny place to wear pearls

spiffing to meet you at last my lady what super fun reverend arnold golightly
reverend how are you i heard about the church last thursday night those ruffians breaking in
you apprehended them as the christian fathers taught me
we must forgive them their trespasses quite literally
some of these young boys deserve a decent thrashing
couldn't agree more sir typical
all the decent men are on the other bus or time lords
what about this special guest you promised us
here she is a lady who needs no introduction
oh no please don't thank you lady eddison honestly there's no need agatha christie what about her that's me no
you're kidding
agatha christie i was just talking about i said i bet she's brilliant i'm the doctor this is donna oh i love your stuff what a mind you fool me every time well almost every time well once or twice well once but it was a good once
you make a rather unusual couple no we're not married
we're not a couple obviously not no wedding ring
oh you don't miss a trick
and i'd stay that way if i were you the thrill is in the chase never in the capture
mrs. christie i'm so glad you could come i'm one of your greatest followers i've read all six of your books is mr. christie not joining us
is he needed can't a woman make her own way in the world
don't give my wife ideas
now mrs. christie i've a question why a belgian detective
belgians make such lovely buns
i say where on earth's professor peach he'd love to meet mrs. christie said he was going to the library miss chandrakala would you go and collect the professor
at once my lady the date on this newspaper what about it
it's the day agatha christie disappeared
professor peach professor
she'd just discovered her husband was having an affair
you'd never think to look at her smiling away
it's about to happen
right here right now professor
the library murder murder
oh my goodness
bashed on the head a blunt instrument watch broke as he fell time of death was a quarter past four
bit of pipe call me hercule poirot but i reckon that's blunt enough
nothing worth killing for in that lot dry as dust
hold on the body in the library i mean professor peach in the library with the lead piping
let me see out of my way gerald
saints preserve us oh how awful someone should call the police
come along do as the doctor says leave the room undisturbed
the plucky young girl who helps me out
no policewomen in nineteen twenty six
i'll pluck you in a minute why don't we phone the real police
well the last thing we want is p. c. plod sticking his nose in especially now i've found this morphic residue
morphic doesn't sound very nineteen twenty six
gets left behind when certain species genetically re encode
the murderer's an alien
which means one of that lot is an alien in human form
yeah but think about it there's a murder a mystery and agatha christie
so happens to me all the time
no but isn't that a bit weird agatha christie didn't walk around surrounded by murders not really i mean that's like meeting charles dickens and he's surrounded by ghosts at christmas
well oh come on it's not like we
could drive across country and find enid blyton having tea with noddy could we noddy's not real is he tell me there's no noddy there's no noddy next thing you know you'll be telling me it's like murder on the orient express and they all did it
murder on the orient express
oh yeah one of your best
but not yet marvellous idea though
anyway agatha and i will question the suspects donna you search the bedrooms look for clues any more residue you'll need this
is that for real
go on you're ever so plucky right then solving a murder mystery with agatha christie brilliant
how like a man to have fun while there's disaster all around him
sorry yeah i'll work with you gladly
but for the sake of justice not your own amusement
now then reverend where were you at a quarter past four
let me think why yes i remember i was unpacking in my room
no alibi then you were alone
with the lord one is never truly alone and where were you
alone
oh yes all alone totally alone absolutely alone completely all of the time i wandered lonely as the proverbial cloud there was no one else with me not at all not ever
and where were you
at a quarter past four well i went to the toilet when i arrived and then erm oh yes i remember i was preparing myself positively buzzing with excitement about the party and the super fun of meeting lady eddy
we've only got your word for it
that's your problem not mine
and where were you sir
quarter past four dear me let me think ah yes i remember i was in me study reading through military memoirs fascinating stuff took me back to my days in the army started reminiscing mafeking you know terrible war
colonel snap out of it
i was in my study no no no right out of it oh sorry got a bit carried away there
and where were you at a quarter past four my lady
now let me see yes i remember i was sitting in the blue room taking my afternoon tea it's a ritual of mine i needed to gather strength for the duty of hostess i then proceeded to the lawn where i met you doctor and i said and who exactly might you be and what are you doing here and you said i'm the doctor and this is miss donna noble
yes yes you can stop now i was there for that bit
of course excuse me
no alibis for any of them the secret adversary remains hidden we must look for a motive use the little grey cells
oh yes little grey cells good old poirot do you know i've been to belgium yeah i remember i was deep in the ardennes trying to find charlemagne he'd been kidnapped by an insane computer
doctor doctor sorry charlemagne lived centuries ago
i've got a very good memory
for such an experienced detective you missed a big clue
that bit of paper on the fire
you were looking the other way yeah but i saw your reflection you crafty man and this is all that was left
we're still no further forward our nemesis remains at large unless miss noble's found something you won't find anything in there
how come it's locked lady eddison commands it to be so and i command it to be otherwise scotland yard pip pip why's it locked in the first place
many years ago when my father was butler to the family lady eddison returned from india with malaria she locked herself in this room for six months until she recovered since then the room has remained undisturbed there's nothing in here
how long's it been empty forty years why would she seal it off all right i need to investigate you just buttle off nineteen twenty six they've still got bees oh what a noise all right busy bee i'll let you out hold on i shall find you with my amazing powers of detection that's impossible doctor doctor it's a giant wasp
what d'you mean a giant wasp i mean a wasp that's giant
it's only a silly little insect
when i say giant i don't mean big i mean flippin' enormous look at its sting
let me see it's gone buzzed off
but that's fascinating
d. d. d. on't touch it don't touch it let me giant wasp well tons of amorphous insectivorous lifeforms but none in this galactic vector
i think i understood some of those words enough to know that you're completely potty
lost its sting though that makes it defenceless
creature this size got to be able to grow a new one
can we return to sanity there are no such things as giant wasps
exactly so the question is what's it doing here
a murder that's put the cat among the pigeons and no mistake
it's not the stuff of gossip mrs. hart continue with your work
but who'd want to do in the old professor he was always asking questions about that book of his what was all that about
a dead man's folly nothing more though perhaps if he asked about i must go and see my lady
the poor little child
there come on
hey this makes a change there's a monster and we're chasing it
can't be a monster it's a trick they do it with mirrors by all that's holy oh but you are wonderful
now just stop stop there
don't let it get away quick before it reverts back to human form where are you come on there's nowhere to run show yourself oh
my faithful companion this is terrible
excuse me my lady but she was on her way to tell you something
she never found me she had an appointment with death instead
she said the poor little child does that mean anything to anyone
no children in this house for years highly unlikely there will be
mrs. christie you must have twigged something you've written simply the best detective stories
tell us what would poirot do
heaven's sake cards on the table woman you should be helping us
but i'm merely a writer
surely you can crack it these events they're exactly like one of your plots
that's what i've been saying agatha that's gotta mean something
but what i've no answers none i'm sorry all of you i'm truly sorry but i've failed if anyone can help us then it's the doctor not me
do you know what i think those books of yours one day they could turn them into films they could be talking pictures
talking pictures pictures that talk what do you mean oh blimey i've done it again i appreciate you trying to be kind but you're right these murders are like my own creations it's as though someone's mocking me and i've had enough scorn for one lifetime yeah
thing is i had this bloke once i was engaged and i loved him i really did turns out he was lying through his teeth but d'you know what i moved on i was lucky i found the doctor it's changed my life there's always someone else
i see is my marriage the stuff of gossip now
no i just sorry
no matter the stories are true i found my husband with another woman a younger prettier woman isn't it always the way
well mine was with a giant spider but same difference
you and the doctor talk such wonderful nonsense
agatha people love your books they really do they're gonna be reading them for years to come
if only try as i might it's hardly great literature now that's beyond me i'm afraid my books will be forgotten like ephemera hello what's that those flower beds were perfectly neat earlier now some of the stalks are bent over
there you go who'd ever notice that you're brilliant
oh someone came here tooled up the sort of stuff a thief would use
the unicorn he's here
the unicorn and the wasp
your drinks ladies doctor
very good greeves
how about the science stuff what did you find
vespiform sting vespiforms have got hives in the silfrax galaxy
again you talk like edward lear
but for some reason this one's behaving like a character in one of your books
come on agatha what would miss marple do she'd have overheard something vital because the murderer thinks she's a harmless old lady
clever idea miss marple who writes those
no something's inhibiting my enzymes ah i've been poisoned
what do we do what do we do bitter almonds
it's cyanide sparkling cyanide
ginger beer i beg your pardon i need ginger beer
the gentleman's gone mad
i'm an expert in poisons doctor there's no cure it's fatal
not for me i can stimulate the inhibited enzymes into reversal protein i need protein
walnuts brilliant i can't understand you how many words one one word shake milk shake milk milk no not milk um shake shake shake cocktail shaker what do you want a harvey wallbanger harvey wallbanger well i don't know how is harvey wallbanger one word
what do you need doctor
salt i was miming salt salt i need something salty
what about this
what is it salt that's too salty
oh that's too salty what about this what's that anchovies what is it what else um it's a song mammy i don't know camptown races
camptown races
all right then towering inferno
it's a shock look shock i need a shock
right then big shock coming up
detox i must do that more often i mean the detox
doctor you are impossible who are you
a terrible day for all of us the professor struck down miss chandrakala cruelly taken from us and yet we still take dinner
we are british doctor what else must we do
then someone tried to poison me any one of you had the chance to put cyanide in my drink but it rather gave me an idea
and what would that be
well poison drink up i've laced the soup with pepper
ah i thought it was jolly spicy
but the active ingredient of pepper is piperine traditionally used as an insecticide so anyone got the shivers
what the deuce is that
listen listen
no it can't be
show yourself demon
no don't stay where you are out out out not you agatha you've got a long life to lead yet
well we know the butler didn't do it
then who did
my jewellery the firestone it's gone stolen roger
my son my child
that poor footman roger's dead and he can't even mourn him nineteen twenty six it's more like the dark ages
did you enquire after the necklace
lady eddison brought it back from india it's worth thousands
this thing can sting it can fly it could wipe us all out in seconds why's it playing this game
every murder is essentially the same they are committed because somebody wants something
but what does a vespiform want doctor stop it
the murderer is as human as you or i
you're right i've been so caught up with giant wasps i've forgotten you're the expert i'm not i've told you
i'm just a purveyor of nonsense
no no no cos plenty of people write detective stories but yours are the best and why why are you so good agatha christie because you understand you've lived you've fought you've had your heart broken you know about people their passions their hope and despair and anger all of those tiny huge things that can turn the most ordinary person into a killer just think agatha if anyone can solve this it's you i've called you here on this endless night because we have a murderer in our midst and when it comes to detection there's none finer ladies and gentlemen i give you agatha christie
this is a crooked house a house of secrets to understand the solution we must examine them all starting with you miss redmond
but i'm innocent surely
you've never met these people and these people had never met you i think the real robina redmond never left london you're impersonating her
how silly what proof do you have
you said you'd been to the toilet
oh i know this if she was really posh she'd say loo
earlier today miss noble and i found this on the lawn right beneath your bathroom window you heard miss noble was searching the bedrooms and panicked you ran upstairs and disposed of the evidence
i've never seen that thing before in my life
what's inside it the tools of your trade miss redmond
or should i say the unicorn you came to this house with one sole intention to steal the firestone
oh all right then it's a fair cop yes i'm the bleedin' unicorn ever so nice to meet ya i don't fink i took my chance in the dark and nabbed it well go on then you knobs arrest me sling me in jail
so is she the murderer don't be so thick
i might be a thief but i ain't no killer quite
there are darker motives at work and in examining this household we come to you colonel
damn it woman you with your perspicacity you've rumbled me
hugh you can walk but why
my darling how else could i be certain of keeping you by my side
i don't understand you're still a beautiful woman clemency
sooner or later some chap will turn your head i couldn't bear that staying in the chair was the only way i could be certain of keeping you confound it mrs. christie how did you discover the truth
um actually i had no idea i was just going to say you're completely innocent oh sorry
shall i sit down then i think you better had so he's not the murderer
indeed not to find the truth let's return to this far more than the unicorn's object of desire the firestone has quite a history lady eddison i've done nothing you brought it back from india did you not before you met the colonel you came home with malaria and confined yourself to this house for six months in a room that has been kept locked ever since which i rather think means
stop please i'm so sorry
but you had fallen pregnant in india unmarried and ashamed you hurried back to england with your confidante a young maid later to become housekeeper miss chandrakala
clemency is this true
my poor baby i had to give him away the shame of it but you've never said a word i had no choice imagine the scandal the family name i'm british i carry on
and it was no ordinary pregnancy
how can you know that
scuse me agatha this is my territory but when you heard that buzzing sound in the dining room you said it can't be why did you say that
you'd never believe it
the doctor has opened my mind to believe many things
it was forty years ago in the heat of delhi late one night i was alone and that's when i saw it a dazzling light in the sky the next day he came to the house christopher the most handsome man i'd ever seen our love blazed like a wildfire i held nothing back and in return he showed me the incredible truth about himself he'd made himself human to learn about us this was his true shape i loved him so much it didn't matter but he was stolen from me one thousand eight hundred eighty five the year of the great monsoon the river jumna rose up and broke its banks he was taken at the flood but christopher left me a gift a jewel like no other i wore it always part of me never forgot i kept it close always
just like a man flashes his family jewels and you end up with a bun in the oven a poor little child forty years ago miss chandrakala took that newborn babe to an orphanage but professor peach worked it out he found the birth certificate
oh that's maiden maiden name
precisely so she killed him
i did not miss chandrakala feared that the professor had unearthed your secret
she was coming to warn you
so she killed her i did not lady eddison
is innocent because at this point doctor
thank you at this point when we consider the lies and the secrets and the key to these events then we have to consider it was you donna noble
what who did i kill no but you said it all along the vital clue
that this whole thing is being acted out like a murder mystery which means it was you agatha christie
i beg your pardon sir so she killed them
no but she wrote she wrote those brilliant clever books and who's her greatest admirer the moving finger points at you lady eddison
leave me alone so she did kill them
no but just think last thursday night what were you doing
i was i was in the library i was reading my favourite agatha christie thinking about her plots and how clever she must be how is that relevant just think
what else happened on thursday night
i'm sorry
you said on the lawn this afternoon last thursday night those boys broke into your church
that's correct they did i discovered the two of them thieves in the night i was most perturbed what the blazes are you doing boys but i apprehended them
really a man of god against two strong lads a man in his forties or should i say forty years old exactly
lady eddison your child how old would he be now
forty he's forty
your child has come home
this is poppycock
oh you said you were taught by the christian fathers meaning raised in an orphanage
my son can it be
you found those thieves reverend and you got angry a proper deep anger for the first time in your life and it broke the genetic lock you've changed
you realised your inheritance after all those years you knew who you were oh and then it all kicks off cos this isn't just a jewel it's a vespiform telepathic recorder it's part of you your brain your very essence and when you activated so did the firestone it beamed your full identity directly into your mind and at the same time it absorbed the works of agatha christie directly from lady eddison it all became part of you the mechanics of those novels formed a template in your brain you've killed in this pattern because that's what you think the world is turns out we are in the middle of a murder mystery one of yours dame agatha
dame
oh sorry not yet so he killed them yes definitely yes
lady who
lady eddiz z. z. z. on
little bit of buzzing there vicar don't make me angry why what happens then
oh my dear god my child
what'z z. z. to stop me killing you all
forgive me
no no clemency come back keep away keep away my darling
no no more murder if my imagination made you kill then my imagination will find a way to stop you foul creature
wait now it's chasing us
over here come and get me reverend
agatha what are you doing if i started this doctor then i must stop it come on
it's all my fault it's all my fault it's all my fault
you said this is the night agatha christie loses her memory
time is in flux donna this could be the night agatha christie loses her life and history gets changed where's she going the lake she's heading for the lake what's she doing
here i am the honey in the trap come to me vespiform she's controlling it
its mind is based on her thought processes they're linked
quite so doctor if i die then this creature might die with me
don't hurt her you're not meant to be like this you've got the wrong template in your mind it's not listening
how do you kill a wasp drown it just like his father
donna that thing couldn't help itself
neither could i
death comes as the end and justice is served
murder at the vicar's rage needs a bit of work
just one mystery left doctor who exactly are you a. r. g. h. hh
oh it's the firestone it's part of the vespiform's mind it's dying and it's connected to agatha it let her go right at the end the vespiform chose to save someone's life
is she all right though
oh of course the amnesia wiped her mind of everything the wasp the murders
and us she'll forget about us yeah but we've solved another riddle the mystery of agatha christie
and tomorrow morning her car gets found by the side of a lake a few days later she turns up in a hotel in harrogate with no idea of what just happened no one'll ever know
lady eddison and the colonel and all the staff what about them
a shameful story they'd never talk of it too british while the unicorn does a bunk back to london town she could never even say she was there
but what happens to agatha oh great life
met another man married again saw the world wrote and wrote and wrote
she never thought her books were any good though and she must've spent all those years wondering
she did remember
somewhere in the back of her mind it all lingered and that's not all look at the copyright page
facsimile edition published in the year five billion people never stop reading them
she is the best selling novelist of all time
but she never knew well no one knows how they're going to be remembered
all you can do is hope for the best maybe that's what kept her writing same thing keeps me travelling onwards
onwards
this is the biggest library in the universe so where is everyone
run for god's sake run run professor river song archaeologist
the shadows are moving again
how could a shadow be infected it's vashta nerada run
something came to this library and killed everything in it donna
yeah
welcome to football gaffes galore which looks at moments when the beautiful game went horribly wrong there's only one thing better than watching a good game of football and that's watching footballers falling over and missing where your granny could have scored we have loads of clips of the overpaid idiots doing just that don't feel guilty about enjoying it since i've been talking they've earned what you do in a year first up it's the top ten careless hands in world war one they said careless talk costs lives great corner great header great save you div sometimes the save can be a bit too easy at least that's the theory
it's a mistake by the goalkeeper and rudi voeller followed in
you can't blame the keeper here voeller's mullet is bearing down on him like a head mounted ferret that's enough to put anyone off dave beasant was once out injured for several weeks after dropping a jar of mayonnaise on his foot looks like he's been rubbing it on his hands as well oh he's getting it everywhere now experienced sportsman takes mistakes in his stride keeps his cool and dignity knowing the cameras are always on him oh david james wash your mouth out the socceroos' keeper was known as spider in the dressing room after the game he couldn't get out of the bath
and kalac has missed it an awful error from the australia goalkeeper
and he ate flies and regurgitated his food i made that up the truth is pretty boring he's got eight legs
years later brown let in ten goals in one match against gillingham here he is getting a bit of practice in scotland romped home two to zero against this ultra mobile zaire team
and through the goalkeeper two to zero
let's see that again i've seen subbuteo players react quicker than that dalglish twists turns the shot is nothing special but watch the guy behind the goal in the yellow
one can only feel despair for ray clemence
he has to measure the distance between clemence's legs six feet two inches a world record gary sprake forgets the laws of gravity what goes up must come down
and a goal oh and sprake furious with himself as indeed he ought to be
a mistake by danny mcgrain a smile all over the face of steve sumner
it will take a lot better beard clip than that to make the top six
ivanov has taken that right in the stomach
stomach that was a fast train to plum central one for the grandchildren well don't suppose there'll be any now at least he has got a good beard at wolves legend had it that if george berry ever shaved his beard he would lose his famous decision making powers
hesitation in the defence george berry didn't seem to know whether to go for the ball or not and crooks scores'
he may have a beard like a goat but that's where the similarity ends
there she goes
although his team mates called him the doctor socrates' full name was socrates brasileiro sampaio de souza vieira de oliveira he knocked on my door i said who's there doctor socrates brasileiro sampaio de souza vieira de oliveira i said doctor who he wet himself here's lampard senior giving his son frank a lesson in how not to back pass
darling i love you
starting at five with hoddle and waddle
darling i love you diamond lights i'll always need you
granny pat could have got that with her hands tied behind her back
he should have scored knitting
japan should go one to zero up against croatia here oh
and yanagisawa has missed a gift of a chance he wouldn't have missed
she could have got that with a bag over her head which is how she appeared in most family photos jeez that one hands behind her back knitting bag over the head and forced to carry an orange under her chin gran would still have got it
hands tied knitting bag over the head orange under the chin playing stairway to heaven on the banjo all the above plus now senility has taken hold gran would still have nailed it but she may not have had the skill to get into that position she was more of a classic centre forward i'll go out on a bit of a limb here she could have scored that today and she died nearly twenty years ago unbelievable
steve stone must oh no it was lined up for a goal
i'm not sure she'd have got that one she was no good with her left foot it shouldn't be in this list
she'd have had that though my great grandmother could have got that and she was french it's the top six cup final catastrophes watching someone stuff up in a cup final is better than sex that probably says more about my sex life than about the gaffes
what a howler from schwarzer
sydney born mark schwarzer was known as skippy he'd punch people in the face and crap everywhere in at five calamity james is back
james hasn't quite got that and it's in
this was the last f. a. cup final at wembley this mistake was so bad they knocked the whole stadium down tony adams another one who forgets about gravity here he is lifting up match winner steve morrow what goes up must come down
i wonder if that's steve morrow down there they were lifting him on to their shoulders and they dropped him
it's gonna be an own goal it's an own goal
hang on it's the wrong end does that count
and all the pressure now on roberto baggio who has to score
baggio was instrumental in getting italy to this world cup final
it's over the top italian manager sacchi never picked him again
but he went on to become england's penalty coach hang on isn't that gary sprake again
yeah that's vintage sprake all right rubbish our n. o. four really really overused clip
good running by geoff thomas on this side brilliant running he's through can he finish there's the answer
is it a shot is it a cross geoff help us out what the hell was that it's not difficult to get alex ferguson's knickers in a twist but these gaffes get his knickers so twisted they stop the blood flow to his old boy
it's gone straight through taibi
taibi blamed this gaffe on his studs allegedly they were too short there you go told you
schmeichel later appeared on strictly come dancing he lost
united thought he was offside barthez dared him to shoot early and di canio dared giggs for manchester united the goal is gaping that literally was an open goal
ryan giggs proving that the welsh are better at rugby than football and we're rubbish at rugby after this game fergie famously kicked a boot which hit beckham on the head come up with your own punchlines the top seven not so fancy dans showing off on the football field is great when it works but if it goes wrong you're in trouble he's in trouble
oh and it begged a touch and the touch didn't come
take that someone please take it
for roberto baggio
baggio england's penalty coach applying to be skills coach too although it was hotly contested and tony popovic
oh and it's an own goal from popovic
that was his audition tape
dear oh dear a very unfortunate moment for david dunn david dunn nicknamed the new gazza
presumably because he was sloshed
at number one peter crouch everyone knows he's six foot seven but it's a little known fact that he's made entirely of golf clubs it's kevin keegan
keegan's gone to the penalty spot
he played a grand total of twenty five minutes of world cup football but is only remembered for this
the first time he's touched the ball
if he had scored england would probably have made the semi final so many ifs and buts so close and yet so far and all that controlling the ball with your head is harder than it looks but not as difficult as controlling an actual head we found an old man's head down by a railway line once it was a to control be thankful a football hasn't got ears jamie pollock's own goal sent man city crashing down and kept qpr afloat qpr fans hijacked an internet poll and voted him the most influential man of the last two thousand years beating jesus karl marx and einstein who signed for chelsea
vega how did he miss from there
come on ramon my friend headless dave could have scored that
no offside flag he was a long way off target
beesley nothing i say can make that any funnier saying that paul beesley's technique was copied far and wide
why don't they do some reverse goal celebration after own goals a run to the corner flag a shimmy then kill yourself sorry ian dowie i was only joking
the perfect header from ian dowie sadly it was at the wrong end
frank sinclair looking foolish at least he won't do that against chelsea next week oops maybe i jinxed that these are all free kicks that went horribly wrong despite the hours of practice how long do you think scotland spent working this one out england goalkeeper david james used to be a policeman
and roffey
this is the moment he first realised he was a natural remember boys just like we did on the training ground hang on didn't we hit it the scottish f. a. labelled the uruguayans the scum of the earth uruguay accused the scots of filling the ball with helium
derisory shouts from scottish supporters
beckham a dead ball specialist later nicknamed goldenballs back then he was simply known as balls decades from now he'll laugh at that this clip of dixon chipping seaman has been shown eight million times although never in exactly this position on a clips show how long before they release a clip show of the one hundred greatest clip show clip show clips i'm not sure that makes sense there's nothing more humiliating than scoring an own goal
casual casual casual and it's in
apart from your mother turning up halfway through a game and having a go at you for calling your gran pongo i was eight blackburn paid fifteen million quid for kenna in nineteen ninety five if you're quick he's on ebay today with a reserve of one point five oh this clip is pretty complicated goalie handles outside the area defender assumes the ref will blow defender nonchalantly kicks the ball into own net cameraman misses it ref ignores goalie's handball and the own goal stands play to the whistle
oh it's an own goal
come on own up who ordered the scousergram luckily tony hadley's career with spandau ballet was a little more successful than this if you're going to score an own goal make it one to remember go on hammer it home enjoy the moment
oh an own goal by willie donachie
i wonder if donachie ever played for scotland again let me check no frenchman franck queudrue was wittily nicknamed french franck no wonder the french got rid of it davidson stares at the ground in disbelief but there wasn't even a bobble that's why this is at number ten if they'd found ten proper bobble clips this wouldn't be in it we all know the brazilians can bend the ball left and right but not upwards surely what a terrible mistake remember games like this in school not so much a bobble more of a puddle a windy day for this game watch out for that paper cup that's blown on the pitch barry oops that coffee cup now takes pride of place in derby's trophy cabinet that's a true story at least now they had something to put in there this is more of a mud slick this guy obviously never played stuck in the mud when he was a kid now that's a proper bobble own goal would you believe it oh dear the sponsor says it all raul spain's all time leading goalscorer kisses his wedding ring every time he scores apparently after this cock up i'm guessing he had to kiss the boss's liverpool beat spurs two to zero here liverpool boss roy evans joked we brought the portable divot from our training ground it was the same one we used at blackburn so let's see if it is the same one yep there it is
how extraordinary it just completely bobbled right over tim flowers
maybe there should be an inquiry many a true word spoken in jest they rented that divot to ipswich for this important local derby
oh what an error how on earth could that happen extraordinary
and to round it all up our top really really overused clip is the anfield rap
liverpool f. c. is hard as hell united tottenham arsenal watch my lips and i will spell cos they don't just play but they can rap as well
if aliens landed and found this clip what would they make of it
learn them to talk like us i'm rapping now rapping for fun i'm your goalie
as the competition reaches the final round the panel aren't pulling the punches
i thought you were a great understudy
this week the josephs have joined the fight sending some of the girls head over heels there are just two weeks until you decide which girl's life will change forever
time to come out with guns blazing
i'm not here to be an understudy
i deserve to be here
l. believe i should be the girl to play nancy i know i have got the conviction and the determination needed to play this role
i should be nancy because i want her to be feisty and gutsy and she is a woman who has maternal instincts i think the person i don't offer that is sam she's not nancy in that sense
i don't believe some
in that sense of the girls have the experience
needed for this role like sam i don't believe she's got it
i i should be nancy because i think i could bring an edgey different modern twist to the role somebody who i think couldn't would be jodi
the person i think maybe isn't nancy is jodi just because i believe her to be a stereotypical nancy and it's time for something new i'm young and fresh and i would love to redesign
for me i don't think niave has the stamina for t. i know i have the edginess and the rawness and the passion to do eight shows a week as if it was my first
our nancys have chosen songs they feel will prove they can lead the cast of oliver in the west end here first to show us what she's made of is jodie prenger
the most fantastic voice no question i want to know what happens when you are choreographed
i can move like you don't know what with the number i have i can show the gutsy side i have some right good moves l. spoked him in the eye bless him l. can't believe i'm part of the final five nancys i'm just jodie from blackpool i haven't home yet but i'm so grateful for all the support
blackpool style
jodie is little miss blackpool support everybody
i haven't been home in two months i really really just want and do them proud and become nancy i want to get up to the blackpool tower and shout out as many thank yous as i can
think you could definitely be in the semifinal every week we have given awe challenge last week we said we want to see you dance you have proved you can move l. can see you in the pub singing you are my perfect nancy
jodie also you have this quality which nancy would have had you have been round the block a bit rather like john barrowman as a matter of fact
good on you
great way to open the show vocally you are very strong it is hard to move like that singing a big number perfect spot on
andrew last week for the first time you had reservations about jodie you thought maybe she overacted how did you feel tonight
you sang is wonderfully i talked about choreography i don't think it matters so much for the role of nancy the choreography the little you did of it was meatloaf it didn't grab me at all
it looks like meatloaf
we love him
i kept saying communicate with the words you didn't rachel you didn't
i see you more as a great understudy than a leading lady
barry's comment was a real kick in the teeth i have to prove i'm not just an understudy i'm so grateful that i'm still here at the end of the day whether i please the panel or not the public are the ones that make the final decision i just hope they still see me as a nancy
we asked some theatre goers what they thought
rachel is very professional she has a stage presence as well i think she could be nancy
i don't agree with barry's comments
certainly a leading lady in shows to come
she has the acting as well as the singing
definitely my nancy she's singing my favourite
thank you this saturday i'm going to go out and sing my song with confidence not only for the panel but people who support me and believe that i could be their nancy this is for them this week
hoping power ballad will put her in the semifinal it's rachel this twenty six year old belfast beauty has chosen the britney houston whitney houston i will always love you i would only be in your way and i will always love you i will always love you you my darling you i hope life treats you real kind and i hope you have all you ever dreamed of and i wish you joy and happiness but above all this i wish you love and i will always love you i will always love you i will always love you i will always love you you darling i love you oh i'll always love you rachel ladies and gentlemen big song get your breath back i'm going to go to the panel barry was rachel an understudy or a leading lady tonight
she was very near a leading lady just then you sang that beautifully l. don't understand why i was still a little unmoved by the performance i feel there's an emotional ceiling on your performance that you have to breakthrough if you're going to triumph in this competition
let's go to john
i have to disagree with barry i think that was a leading lady performance at the top of the stairs you every emotion in your eye l. would be proud to star opposite you on the west end stage if there is any justice for next week you will be
you should be there i kind of understand what barry is saying what the problem is with you i have been looking at past performance as female watching you i feel you are lack warmth behind the eyes
alienates
lot of females in the audience something you need to work on i know it can be corrected you are a professional
did you see
it is up to the people at home there are five nancys left if you want rachel stay here is the number for later don't call now as i said before the lines open after all the nancys have sung coming up the original olivers have secured the last remaining place in the semi finia now the next potential west end leading lady hoping to prove she has it
you have the stamina for eight shows a week
you are one of the leading contenders
last week i was so happen quay with my comments this week i want to do the same have chosen a song from the musical called wicked
it is our song
bite out the words
to have feed back like her is amazing she thinks i'm good
and put everything from this whole experience into it and remember this moment forever
vocally she definitely did it samantha every week your star is rising rising rising you're so confident so secure in what you do i'm comfortable in watching u. my only comment is it was the same all the way through l. hope you're here i hope the audience sees how secure you are for the semi final
i turn to a long term samantha fan what
have if you're going to be star is what happens off stage making choice you made the brilliant choice so far the song from a west end show that absolutely took you to another notch it was wonderful to hear your voice you are not quite yet a seleen dion because you haven't matured you are potentially a wonderful singer you have the other advantage in that you are very secure of how you move of the five girls you are the best mover you are a wonderful talent i hope to see you in the semi final
company
he's lovely
the country there is no doubt every single one of them deserves a
it is great having denise here you get the feedback from high woman in showbiz
the next test is revealed i have someone called dodger he is currently starring in the west end
playing with a west end actor will be amazing
i've come to london to seek my fortune
the standard was very high top class actors they were brilliant
so talented now it boils down to who is most suited
every one of the boys suited raised the bar one stood out more than all the others l. think has all the attributes to play oliver i don't think he's quite there yet he would make a future oliver gordon brown is one of the most animated performers he has thrown himself into all the material he will have a future joseph has grown so much during the series i have no doubt that is he could take on a leading role but he's not quite there gareth has such a wonderful personal tee i know he will be a huge success in life today jonny turned in i would say the finest acting performance of all of them
congratulations you could still be oliver i have your cap for you you can pick it up later jonny i have asked the before you and i will ask you now you are just one step away from becoming oliver which of nancys do you want to go all the way to win the role
people sam gareth jordan and joseph you are our runners up you might no longer be in the running for the role of oliver but certainly have been stars of saturday night
this has been amazing a once in a live expeerence now use every minute of it
the best bit has to be performing to the live audience it is what i love doing and i want to carry on doing that
i have really enjoyed this experience messing around with all the other olivers i think i have become a better dancer than i was my vocal has gotten better i'm thankful to claire kevin and lisa because they have made the experience wonderful
i have had a really good time
meeting the boys and the nancys
will be telling my children my great grand children everybody about this it is dream come true probably get a bit of stick my acting has really come on my dancing everything is coming together and i'm getting better the time here has just been the time of my life
ladies and gentlemen sam gareth jordan and joseph well done guys they are here now performing reach with the rest of our olivers urchins take it away when the world leaves you feeling blue you can count on me i will be there for you when it seems all your hopes and dreams are a million miles away i will reassure you we've got to all stick together good friends there for each other never ever forget that i've got you and you've got me so reach for the stars climb every mountain higher reach for the stars follow your heart's desire reach for the stars and when that rainbow's shining over you that's when your dreams will all come true don't believe in all that you've been told the sky's the limit you can reach your goal no one knows just what the future holds there ain't nothing you can't be there's a whole world at your feet i said reach climb every mountain
reach for the moon reach follow that rainbow
and your dreams will all come true reach for the stars climb every mountain higher reach for the stars follow your heart's desire reach for the stars and when that rainbow's shining over you that's when your dreams will all come true reach how brilliant are they well done guys our olivers will be back tomorrow night in our results show time to get back to our nancys our next candidate is taking her inspiration from her family hoping for a home spun victory it's county kerry's jessie buckley
it was not good on saturday night
that was very bad diction and very unclear i'm not sure i can see you behind an east end pub bar
you did shout a lot and it was painful on the ears
i felt i didn't deserve to be in the competition thankfully the public believed i should be i'm really grateful
this week i'm dedicating my song to my baby sister lily unfortunately i missed her birthday today jessie coming
we really miss jessie and we're all behind her
every weekend one of us leaves london to support jessie and the other one stays at home and enjoys the competition
performance you sang it very well and well acted i enjoyed the performance when you move you are so unfeminine but it doesn't worry me it would be interesting to have a tomorrow boy nancy tomboy nancy
jessie's is she still a contender to be a nancy
stay with jessie i say that l. really because i'm pretty certain about it you chose that song and i'm not sure i would have done l. think you're real star area is in the realms of the the man that got away and you were going up into an area of your voice that you were not that i hope next week if you are still with us which i hope you will that you really go into the place where you feel that you can be jessie i think you're trying to be somebody else last week was a disastrous choice this week but i know there is another side of you to come out
hopefully i get the chance
as long as he needs she is in your comfort zone you would be fantastic in that song because it doesn't go high up into the chest notes
have a line in the play and you dig your nails into bill sikhs and you say you will put his mark on him
i'm not sure you will do it i'm so frustrated it is constantly the question of my fragility
you have a wave like quality
i may look fragile but i don't let anyone walk over me it is twice he has saved me thank the lord i'm ready to fight for my place this
than the older one i'm not that performance would register at the back of the stalls rather than some of the performances i had for me tonight that is not a nancy
performance that was gritty i thought niamh which was something i think you were aiming for there is just one problem that i see this is not your fault the star of this show is not fagan not nancy but oliver twist and a group small boys the fact of the matter is it is a matter of scale you are a comparatively small person so these boys are going to look like giants clustering around you i do see that as a serious technical problem
barry has a point
quick change quick change rachel back
now five nancys remain
i'm going asleep
sunday morning we're up bright and breezy we're off to meet the musical director
you may think this is fun and games
this is not the normal life for nobody it is the redcar pet
morning
i'm so tired
it will be no torvil and dean
it was really fun working with ben
no flirting just work
this is really scary
hiya chuck
another mission over thank goodness for that
it's nice to not focus on your solos and do the group work with the olivers
i love training with
the nancys because her hot all all the olivers are well behaved but the nancys are really funny and out of control
you have a dirty mouth
friday we do some costume fittings
what is the secret of good comedy
sorry sir this is a cheese shop
i'm not funny people normally laugh at me not with me
i don't know if that
one of the tricky things about the script was that you've got agatha christie in an agatha christie murder mystery
plenty of people write detective stories but yours are the best
but this is the real agatha christie
why are you so good agatha christie
action armchair detective
become an armchair detective and get all clued up with confidential as we travel back behind the scenes to britain in the roaring twenties
it's a murder mystery
morphic residue
but not one you've read before
you are wonderful
there's a party atmosphere on location in south wales for the filming of the doctor's latest adventure this week the art department have gone all art deco arranging a period cocktail reception where guests will soon be both shaken and stirred by a mysterious death with so many shady suspects on set it's murder for the director
good afternoon my lady topping day what spiffing top hole
no no no no no don't do that don't
and cut can i just do erm
the making of this was very time consuming because when you've got nine or ten people in a scene they all have to be covered you've got to do a developing shot then a close up of that person then move round and do that person maybe you want two shots and three shots that all takes time every time you set the camera up to do a new shot it's at least twenty minutes each time over and over and over and over and over like a monkey with a miniature cymbal the joy of repetition really is in you
action
good afternoon my lady topping day what
and action good afternoon my lady
topping day what spiffing
and action doctor how could i forget you
but one must be sure with the unicorn on the loose
given the fact that it's a whodunnit it couldn't be anything other than a big cast
we kind of knew it was a traditional agatha christie whodunnit we wanted to take the essence of agatha christie
it's essential in a whodunnit you have to have an ensemble cast a big large cast full of suspects
and action
good afternoon professor peach
first you've got professor peach i need to check something in the library ooh alone who doesn't make it through the opening titles
i say what are you doing with that lead piping
but somebody's got to be the first to go no
then old lady eddison the lady of the house
forgive me but who exactly might you be and what are you doing here
charming genteel mannered society lady but with a mysterious past
oh my god
everyone's got his secret so everyone's got a motive that's traditional in a murder mystery
action my husband
then you have colonel hugh
devoted sociable clubbable man life and soul of the party
don't give my wife ideas
who is also harbouring quite a major secret in that he's been in a wheelchair for twenty odd years and doesn't need to be
confound it mrs. christie how did you discover the truth
forty five take one b. camera only
then you have their son roger
my word you are a super lady
typical all the decent men are on the other bus
then there's davenport your usual sir
thank you davenport just how i like it
the handsome charming butler who might be a little closer to one of the family than he should be in nineteen twenty six
some of these young boys deserve a decent thrashing
couldn't agree more sir
miss redmond spiffing to meet you at last my lady
miss robina edmond is there the charm of the london society socialite funny wonderful clever also strangely hiding a secret so she looks like a suspect early on but actually is hiding a completely different layer of motives
oh all right then it's a fair cop
she's a scrubber from the east end who's stealing everybody's jewellery
go on then you nobs arrest me
miss chandrakala who's been with the family for a very long time
look sharp we have guests
you have to have the faithful servant who knows where the bodies are buried she's been in the household for years and knows what's going on
the library murder murder
also greeves the butler because there's got to be a butler in case the butler did it
you won't find anything in there
then reverend golightly of course
ah reverend how are you
charming and polite honourable and decent
as the christian fathers taught me we must forgive them their trespasses
he has the biggest secret of them all he turns into an alien wasp when nobody's looking
what's to stop me killing you all
that's probably the bit you wouldn't necessarily find in a traditional agatha christie novel
a camera only
there is a mysterious footman in disguise creeping his way through the garden party drawing attention to himself beautifully but is in fact david tennant's father making a cameo appearance
forty nine take one
i was coming down to visit david and i think they must have been short of someone but they very kindly invited me to play the part of a footman
sidecar please and a lime and soda thank you
which has been interesting and i didn't have to learn any lines so that was good news hello i'm the doctor how do you do
my lady where's this special guest you promised us
finally the final guest you bring in is agatha christie herself
here she is a lady who needs no introduction
no no please don't
miss agatha christie running away from her husband in nineteen twenty six in terrible circumstances
thank you lady eddison honestly there's no need
finding herself in a situation where the patterns of her own books are repeating around her so what's going on agatha christie was hard to cast actually very tough actually we didn't have a clue it was david tennant who suggested fenella cos he'd worked with her in bright young things
fenella woolgar as agatha christie was my idea thank you i'd like to take credit for that every now and again i'll suggest i've known fenella for years we've worked together a couple of times i've always been a big fan of her
we got her in to audition and she was perfect read one line and we went that's it absolutely brilliant
agatha christie what about her that's me no
it's the only time i've made a suggestion they've taken up i'm always trying to get my mates on the show never happens agatha christie i was talking about you the other day i said i bet she's brilliant i'm the doctor this is donna oh i love your stuff what a mind
fenella woolgar who plays agatha has a very individual look and strength about her and an intelligence about her
you make a rather unusual couple
we're not a couple we're not married obviously not no wedding ring
oh oh you don't miss a trick
her class feels right for agatha for somebody with that kind of strength at that time
i'd stay that way if i were you the thrill is in the chase never in the capture
she has a quality which is absolutely extraordinary and just zones in on nineteen twenty six and that period she just has it
is um mr. christie not joining us
is he needed can't a woman make her own way in the world
i'm very proud to say that fenella was my idea i'm gonna keep repeating it fenella was my idea good idea wasn't it yeah you should listen to me more for casting suggestions i'm quite good at it
you've written simply the best detective stories
fenella had a degree of vulnerability
i'm afraid my books will be forgotten like ephemera
and insecurity which i think particularly at that unhappy period of her life my grandmother did have as such i found her a convincing portrayal of the role
i found my husband with another woman a younger prettier women isn't it always the way
the whole idea of agatha christie comes from our producer phil collinson almost two years ago we were driving from cardiff to manchester he said do you know what i've always wanted to see in doctor who a murder mystery story with agatha christie in it
think about it there's a murder a mystery and agatha christie
so happens to me all the time
i laughed for twenty miles and ten minutes i just thought that was the most brilliant idea i just said right we'll do it
that's like meeting charles dickens and he's surrounded by ghosts at christmas well
bumping into figures from history is one of the doctor's specialties something he's done ever since the programme's creation way back when in the william hartnell years
he's planning to usurp my crown and trade with my enemy philip of france
this way ladies gentlemen
the doctor has met pretty much every main player in history
leonardo
either on screen or off
the paintings went down very well
in the colin baker era he met george stephenson
this valve's the problem your invention will take off like a rocket stephenson he's got probably got a list somewhere and is ticking them off
i'll explain how it works later it's all relative
when it comes to the modern day series it's something i wanted to do every year
rose might i introduce her majesty queen victoria
remember the old days remember the old days
where are we when are we
can you tell me what year it is
one thousand seven hundred twenty seven
step back in time step back in time
dickens yes charles dickens
yes the charles dickens step back in time
i'm such a big fan
how exactly are you a fan in what way do you resemble a means of keeping oneself cool
who the hell are you
i'm the doctor and i just snogged madame de pompadour ha ha ha excuse me not interrupting am i mr. shakespeare isn't it oh no no no no who let you in
how modern
no autographs no you can't have yourself sketched with me and please don't ask where i get my ideas from
step back in time
let me say goodbye to you with a new verse a sonnet for my dark lady
queen elizabeth i doctor wish me luck
off with his head run
see ya
ooh when you're looking for a famous historical figure to put in a story
i am the queen of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland
it's not that you're looking for a writer necessarily you're looking for a way of framing that story and agatha christie allows you to do a lovely murder mystery set up
agatha christie is the most popular writer in terms of book sales of all time
i am one of your greatest followers i've read all six of your books
unless you count the bible and who knows who wrote that so it just seemed a big clear target to do obvious in the best possible way
in using agatha christie you also bring in the whole pastiche of the whodunnit even using things like the cluedo board
the body in the library i mean professor peach in the library with the lead piping
i'm not sure agatha christie ever did actually do a death with lead piping what is lead piping i don't know what it pipes or what it leads to but it's there so it starts to use that whole genre of things
it was you donna noble
what who did i kill
it is almost a parody of what you might expect from agatha christie it was you agatha christie
i beg your pardon sir
there are tons of references to the titles of agatha christie books in the script
murder on the orient express
oh yeah one of your best
but not yet marvellous idea though
miss marple who writes those
um copyright donna noble add it to the list
it was a contest between me and russell to find ways of putting them in there
cards on the table appointment with death
cat among the pigeons a dead man's folly
endless night they do it with mirrors
the moving finger nemesis
body in the library sparkling cyanide
death comes as the end crooked house murder at the vicar's rage
needs a bit of work
initially we were torn about whether to make agatha christie the young agatha christie that we have with fenella or an older agatha christie in actual fact we thought hold on it would have to be set in the sixties or seventies and that feels very wrong it should be set in the twenties and that ties in with her famous disappearance which we wanted to address right from the start
actually in nineteen twenty six agatha christie did actually disappear for a substantial number of days and was later found at harrogate
she's driven out in this car into the middle of nowhere for eleven days she disappears and then she turns up at this spa it gives you something nice to play with for a doctor who story what happened then
read the date on this newspaper
what about it it's the day agatha christie disappeared now mama after you've gone and left me cryin' after you've gone there's no denyin'
i think my grandmother's disappearance is the only event that i have read of at that particular time which rivalled some modern day events in the extent of the publicity that it attracted the coverage was absolutely enormous a lot of people i fear thought that it was a publicity stunt engineered by publishers or whoever or even maybe my grandmother herself to publicise her latest book the murder of roger ackroyd if you knew my grandmother you would know that she was incapable of dreaming up a publicity stunt she spent most of her life avoiding publicity particularly after this event i don't think anybody will know the exact truth i doubt even although i never discussed it with her even my grandmother herself really knew the truth
there's been a lot of speculation about it whether she had a meeting whether she knew whether it was a bit of a breakdown whether it was planned there's endless reams of conjecture about it that's a perfect gap for doctor who to slip in and say this is what really happened she was fighting a giant wasp of course
by all that's holy
we had a lot of chats about how the doctor who story would enter into the agatha christie story and bring the two genres together
vespiforms have got hives in the sylphrax galaxy
again you talk like edward lear
initially there was talk of saucers abducting her and probing her but in the end we went for the simplest option which was that we'd play a whodunnit
absolutely a classic whodunnit with all the classic reasons for killing and all the suspects everything as normal but the killer was a shape shifting alien
it's a giant wasp
it's a giant wasp because in nineteen sixty nine or something i used to buy agatha christie books when i was a kid cos i loved them my mother loved them she had the paperbacks and i always loved this death in the clouds paperback
christie agatha look at that
when you're young you think it's about an aeroplane being attacked by a giant wasp it's symbolic there is no giant wasp what a disappointment that was but i always loved that cover it just chimed with me for this story the english country gardens tea and scones wasps in the air the gardens the sunshine it just fitted somehow
i don't like them very much they're not my favourite creatures
what do you mean a giant wasp i mean a wasp that's giant
they've got that buzzing vengeful quality it was nice to contrast that with the identity of the human murderer
he finds out um much to his amazement that he's actually a vespiform
look at its sting
and when he gets very angry it's all a bit hulk grrr when he gets angry quiet that's the reverend golightly
it's chasing us
over here come and get me reverend
come on
i knew i had to get the vespiform away from the house and i knew i had to get agatha by that lake and agatha's car abandoned there and i knew the wasp had to be dealt with at the lake
five hundred ninety take one b. camera only
you can deal with a wasp by smacking it with a newspaper you can let it out of the window which wasn't an option
and action
or you can smear some honey and make a little honey trap that it will fall into and drown it
here i am the honey in the trap come to me vespiform
i've done all three and that's one of my favourites
its mind is based on her thought processes they're linked
quite so doctor if i die then this creature might die with me
don't hurt her you're not meant to be like this you've got the wrong template in your mind it's not listening
and cut
what we had to do was construct a solid shape like a giant wasp shape and then plonk it in the water so that the ripple that it made was equivalent to an eight foot wasp hitting the water
take me to the river drop me in the water
ideally we're going to have it smashing down at an angle it's going to dive or fly over agatha the doctor and donna's heads what we've tried to do is get our big black bag swinging from side to side and as it's swinging at its most we cut the wire and it hits into the water
take me to the river drop me in the water
maximum you can get keith on you keith we're speeding whenever you're ready next one maybe
on dry land and back at the house the murder mystery continues and it's left a rather unpleasant taste in the time lord's mouth in the kitchens today the crew are cooking up the shots of a poisoned doctor
what do we do what do we do
i would like to just see a load of stuff go flying through
i can grab that knock them off and then i'm out
we witness the doctor coming in and eating loads of anchovies walnuts
one to fifty take three c. camera mark action ginger beer i beg your pardon i need ginger beer
the gentleman has gone mad and it is absolutely manic he messes up her kitchen so she's not impressed action
it's not just the props taking some punishment the doctor's tailoring is also getting trounced
he pours water all over himself as well as drinks it
i'm an expert poisons doctor there is no cure
i wanted the doctor to be poisoned and immediately that set me thinking about how the doctor would react to being poisoned
i can stimulate the inhibited enzymes into reversal protein i need protein
he's got a different body chemistry to us he knows a lot more about chemistry them we know he would know what kind of things he could find in a kitchen to use to cure himself
walnuts brilliant
i also realised that led to potential for donna to not understand what was going on
can't understand you
to reach for the wrong things to not understand what he was saying through mouthfuls of food
how many words one word milkshake milk no not milk shake shake um cocktail shaker what do you want a harvey wallbanger
harvey wallbanger well i don't know how is harvey wallbanger one word
what do you need doctor salt i was miming salt
i need something salty
what about this what is it salt that's too salty oh that's too salty
what about this mm what's that anchovies what is it what else
it's a song mammy
i think russell sees it as essential that every companion and the doctor have a bit of a kiss of some description shock i need shock i need shock it's become a law of modern doctor who cos people love a bit of that don't they they love to speculate on it
right then big shock coming up
of course as usual it's not really a kiss it's something else detox oh ah i must do that more often but it's good isn't it it's fun shove these things in keep you guessing i mean the the detox and cut
look who's coming to dinner it's the principal artists of course and each of them has an appointment with death it's a moody setting where the menu always offers the possibility of poison
i wanted it to be creepy a rather tense edgy scene in which the audience knows something's going to happen any minute somebody else is going to die
it's a dark climax it relies heavily on the skills of the lighting and camera crew
the characters are having a candlelit dinner and the vespiform breaks in through the window and blows out all the candles so what i had to do was light it warmly as though it was lit by candles
a terrible day for all of us
and then the candles get blown out so we have to change the light into a night time effect a moonlight effect light coming from a different direction as the windows are burst open by the vespiform we introduced the flashing lightning effect
the crew are simultaneously creating candlelight making moonlight and then they will let rip with the lightning
one two three
and action
a terrible day for all of us the professor struck down miss chandrakala cruelly taken from us
it is difficult this one you realise why it must take so long to do a miss marple or a poirot
and cut thank you if all you do is shoot the vicar you know the vicar dunnit
so you've got to shoot everyone which means that everyone goes into a slight panic everything is all hushed everyone's like we've a lot to cover today we've got at least twelve people we need a mid shot and a close up of the lot of them otherwise you'll know who did it so it's quite weird that it puts quite a lot of pressure on the crew everyone has to work really fast got to get it all done very quickly
and action
any one of you had the chance to put cyanide in my drink
ah i thought it was jolly spicy
but the active ingredient of pepper is piperine traditionally used as an insecticide oh anyone got the shivers
and cut very good thank you all thank you all ladies and gents as we get to the end of this sequence i would like to take it up to flash of light and the lights go out flash of light and the window crashes open so i get everybody trying to look towards the window the lights go out windows crash open candles are blown out
they are making light work of it but it is no mean feat
anyone got the shivers
bang
it's a question of getting all these lights in sync and perfect timing
bang
and making certain it's all tied in together at the right time the right place regarding the script regarding reaction to the actors and so forth
and action i laced the soup with pepper ah i thought it was jolly spicy
i'm reading the script from what's called sides firing the lightning from a detonator
anyone got the shivers
bang
bit of practice and a bit of preparation and a bit of luck lifts it together
what the deuce is that listen listen listen what i wanted to get out of it was tension the edge
no it can't be
a very fast action moment where we discover eventually someone has died
show yourself demon
show yourself demon she is aware of the atmosphere a spurt of something show yourself demon now people that makes people terrified and you start to walk away and whatever so show yourself demon oh i don't like this you go running away stay where you are now it starts to rise up now you start to go oh my god yes
out and that's it
panic and chaos ensues obviously because none of us has never seen anything like this before
nobody move stay where you are
you see the vespiform you see this wasp suddenly appear and rise up into the heavens in this huge dining room you don't see who changed and who became the wasp etc you see them all running around even at the time when the wasp starts to make its sound
out out out out
so whoever it was was actually running around and was actually making that sound but who was it well of course we now know it was the reverend
not you agatha you've got a long life to lead yet
well we know the butler didn't do it who did
action
then later on i get knifed in the back
my child
it was just cranking up the suspense you know making each murder as different as possible from the last one so
heavens we have the lead piping with the professor at the beginning no
he discovers what is going on he discovers the family tree so the reverend has to shut him up
miss chandrakala being crushed by the statue
she has been with lady eddison and is one of the few who knows her secret she meet a sticky end as well
roger is the one who would have inherited everything from the curbishley and eddison estates so he is knocked off because the reverend feels robbed of his inheritance he's had a modest quiet poor life actually these people have this vast estate and they should all be his he is claiming his birthright cut cut i'm sorry about your ear can we plug it
i think that's it do you yes great thank you very much all thank you guys
thank you very much for the extra time folks really really good
i feel a little tired er um i think i could do with a massage maybe a sauna
as two vintage vehicles tootle on to set completing the shoot looks likely to be a bumpy ride for the cast david and fenella have just a few hours to get to grips with these classic cars before filming the climactic chase sequence
it's exciting just because it's fun to drive these things at the same time you are always aware that the owner of the car is usually there looking at you very beadily because these cars are by their very nature quite rare and therefore quite expensive
it's a different sort of driving experience and if you're not used to it you are aware that you don't want to be blowing the engine or destroying the gearbox
i'll show you what's possible
the lake she's heading for the lake
i think so
oh yes oh yes excellent right what am i doing
we were slightly struggling to keep up with nelly just because her car's faster than yours i went faster than i realised we were heating i did it in one take didn't i
i did i did it in one take one go way to go
maybe i can go up into third on the slope earlier that's when it died so i was trying to keep it going i'll slow it down a bit hello i could get it going but it didn't have much speed it didn't have a lot of poke to it of course inevitably when you're filming there's a camera car somewhere as well and you're trying to stay a certain distance in front of them so that they can get a shot that's difficult in a modern car but when you're driving something you don't have all the control you wish for it can be a difficult especially when you're going up hills and the engine just doesn't want to know we're driving a sewing machine behind you
i'm sorry david am i showing you up a little bit
it's not me it's the engineering
are you sure the engineering of past ages you know what they say about lady drivers david what what was that david's car goes on the low loader please ah ah you're obviously not good enough clearly i'm driving you on the low loader
there's no more driving for david as the car is secured to the camera truck
and then i was able to do tight work on doctor and donna or tight work on agatha there's a moment when she's saying
it's all my fault it's all my fault
all those moments need to be really well shot classically cleanly and in focus
action time is in flux donna
for all we know this is the night agatha christie loses her life and history gets changed where's she gone the lake she's heading for the lake i enjoyed it and i didn't blow it up i didn't break it which is always a plus the library the library is the biggest library in the universe
they're always a bit shadowy a bit other worldly
and the dust in the sunbeams it suddenly resonated how scary this episode is
what if the darkness itself could get you
i think it's beckett
it is samuel beckett it's the opening of waiting for godot off to a flying start your second quotation now i want the author's name again it's from the opening chapter of a work of one thousand eight hundred eighty seven it's another two iconic literary figures and they are meeting for the first time
it's conan doyle
it's sir arthur conan doyle when doctor watson meets sherlock holmes for the first time in a study in scarlet but you have to make a connection now between quotations one and two what is the connexion miranda and anthony between samuel beckett and sir arthur conan doyle i'll give you a clue it's a sporting connexion
i think it's football you think it's football you're wrong
i'm handing it over to giles and wendy for a quick single point what is the connexion
i think they're both in wisden
is it wordsworth it is wordsworth from the prelude
no that's absolutely the wrong sport a chance to pick up a point
tennis we're going for tennis i'm afraid it's not tennis
the answer improbably is netball is ice skating wordsworth was a keen ice skater his skates are on display at dove cottage he described himself skating in the prelude all shod with steel we hissed along the polished ice the other one's a bit more bizarre e. f. benson represented england at figure skating
great fun at the end of that round
see boys you see what we have here regard please the hideous face of this primitive creature it reminds you of and the eager responses sir the devil sir please sir one cousin of mine no a vegetable sir i don't know which until zagallo shouting above the tumult silence sons of baboons
it's a commonwealth author
um
if you can't get your head around it i'll pass it straight over without further ado
you think it's alexander mccall smith perhaps you're very far off the mark
it's a good guess though i thought it might be but i thought it would sound so silly if it was wrong we've got no shame
the answer is salman rushdie reading from midnight's children here's your supplementary question what special literary prize did midnight's children win in nineteen ninety three
oh was it a bad sex award no it was the booker of bookers oh was it best booker of the first
best of the booker prize winners of the first twenty five years of the award i won the bad sex award it originally won the booker in what year nineteen eighty one nineteen eighty one very good that's your points there let's come over to anthony and miranda here is your first extract recorded just four years ago in two thousand four
god willing i shall live to see you read these words to witness your astonishment and see your dark eyes widen and your jaw drop when you finally comprehend the injustice we poor irish suffered in this present age because he's australian and it's irish
yeah go then what do you think it is
carey it is indeed peter carey reading from the true history of the kelly gang
here is your supplementary question peter carey like salman rushdie began his career in which industry
advertising
yes advertising very good have you any idea what salman rushdie did in the advertising industry while he was writing midnight's children
peter carey worked on accounts for volkswagen surely an extra point no more points rushdie was devising the cream cake slogan naughty but nice while writing midnight's children here is your next piece of audio another commonwealth author reading from her own work in two thousand five for wendy and giles two points if you can tell us her name
just this i had to sit on the bed my legs gave way there was no bounce underneath me as i fell just this yes this is it you bring me all this way for just this
female commonwealth novelist
um
we thought it was toni morrison but she's american isn't she
no orange she won the whitbread the orange and also the commonwealth writers' prize
big clue
supplementary question for wendy and giles in that extract what is the name of the character speaking to her husband gilbert
no idea have you intimate knowledge of small island no
you don't know no over to anthony and miranda i can't remember the answer is hortense
yeah
this is your extract miranda and anthony another commonwealth author reading from her own work from nineteen ninety nine two points if you tell me her name
time is not a line but a dimension like dimensions in space if you can bend space you can bend time also and if you knew enough and could move faster than light you could travel backwards in time and exist in two places at once
margaret atwood it is margaret atwood cat's eye but you have a supplementary on this
margaret atwood is credited with inventing a device designed to make the process of book signing easier what is it
it's the autosigner she signs it on a computer at one end and the person's at the other end in another country exactly right
the answer is the long pen it lets her sign on a touch pad on her p. c. which via the internet can activate a robotic pen on a remote p. c. anywhere in the world it's so impersonal it's not the same
i wouldn't use one if you want to see anthony horowitz or wendy holden you don't want to see autosigning
just get a stamp she wrote the handmaid's tale this terrible vision of the future
and depersonalising and other terrible visions of the future
at the end of that round let's see what the terrible vision is wendy and giles are trailing with seven and miranda and anthony are storming ahead with twelve now i'm going to ask each team to identify books from a set of visual clues to its contents characters incidents or themes we're starting with miranda and anthony you have a set of clues in front of you tell me what is the novel they represent
what's that a wolf it's a wolf
and what's that it's heaven is it
or a wood a midnight wood what's this plant it looks like cannabis
kirsty wouldn't do that to us if that's your predilection
and some ruined abbey and a for sale sign
goodness knows we are pretty stumped here pretty stumped
well it looks like wendy thinks it's whitby abbey
i think the for sale thing is the tenant of something should we try the tenant i need an answer from you shall we try the tenant of wildfell hall
i'm afraid it's not it's dracula by bram stoker
what's the for sale let me talk you through it it's bloodthirsty estate agents
jonathan harker travels to transylvania to arrange the sale of an english property hence the for sale sign to count dracula on the journey he sees the phenomenon called will o' the wisp the count was able to transform himself into a wolf and is repelled by wild garlic travels to england and arrives at
which work of fiction is this
there's an apple here yeah an apple core that's good
there's a blacksmith at the beginning of great expectations that's a prison and magwitch was a convict what's the apple pip
it is indeed great expectations the apple was a direct clue to philip pirrip's name pip growing up in a blacksmith's as a child he has a graveyard encounter with a convict
magwitch who is later transported
so who are these people is that that's a certain emperor i don't know who that is
is that some kind of graveyard that looks like florence florence no it can't be florence and we have a luminous tampon
somewhere in italy is all i can say it's venice
let's just say death in venice let's just say death in venice
if you said death in venice by thomas mann you would be correct the protagonist gustave von aschenbach is author of a biography of frederick the great the figure of recurs in various forms during his stay in venice where he contracts cholera which looks like a luminous tampon and the final image is of venice's isle of the dead very good that's a cholera bacterium then is it must be
not actual size
your pictures for wendy and giles which novel can be represented by these pictures
is that stirling castle what castle is it edinburgh castle and is this john knox or one of those could be
repressive scots you mean exactly
that's mussolini this is the campanile in florence
something to do with scotland something to do with italy but who's this man
go on anthony which novel
the only book we can think of is captain corelli's mandolin because mussolini was in it and the fellow on the right might be playing a mandolin
their questions are so much easier
chick lit does miranda read chick lit
she'll pretend she doesn't but probably does all the time
over to you i think oh no that's so sexist now now now that is so sexist anthony
because it's actually about fiction with chickens in isn't it exactly there you are your question might not be the kind of chicks you were thinking about i want you to tell me which bird appears in the title of the following ah first chekhov's play about madame arkadina and her son konstantin
the seagull indeed which fictional bird first appeared in nineteen oh eight
oh jemima puddle duck jemima puddle duck
jemima puddle duck guess who's got the young child according to adrian mole's father no other book can ever compare to it which book does he mean it's a worldwide bestseller which first appeared in nineteen seventy
oh i know jonathan livingston seagull
i think less than that let's say thirty thirty thirty thirty million
you're saying thirty million i'll see if the other side can do a bit better
one hundred million well you're so far off
no it's forty million so you don't get the points now it's your turn we have to choose one of those you have left which one to choose not motoring it'll be james bond
you're going to go for school fiction could be about fish
very true i'm going to give you a list of the chums
of a famous fictional schoolboy or schoolgirl and i want their names in each case first which eponymous schoolboy's classmates were harry wharton bob merry frank nugent johnny bull and hurree jamset ram singh
it's not jennings and it's not just william billy bunter isn't it
it is indeed billy bunter second which leading character's chums were sally hope alicia johns and wilhelmina known as bill who's completely horse mad
oh that sounds very enid blyton and i can't remember the name of the girl i feel it slipping away can't remember i'm going to pass it over it's malory towers but i can't remember the name of the girl
you're right but i couldn't give you a point you had to name darrell rivers so who were these chums of venables atkinson
jennings jennings
temple and bromwich major in jennings in buckeridge's stories about linbury court and finally diana barry jane andrews ruby gillis and gilbert blythe
are there any famous girls in children's books that you can think of
er any will do
three girls and a boy going to get it no idea no
gilbert blythe i do declare anne shirley from maud lucy montgomery's anne of green gables so at the end of round four the scores are wendy and giles with thirteen and miranda and anthony still well ahead on twenty but there's still lots of time still lots of time to catch up now for round five i'm going to show both teams a crossword style clue to a well known book title two teams for whichever team buzzes in first with the correct title if neither team can get it i'll give you the author's name but then only one point for the correct title so fingers on the buzzers each of you individually on this one for your teams though the first one is and it's miranda

the hound of the baskervilles
the hound of the baskervilles sir arthur conan doyle is correct and let's now have the scores at the end of this round wendy and giles twenty four still not catching up with miranda and anthony on thirty one now we're going to find out what our teams can recall under pressure if they haven't already been doing so and against the clock miranda and anthony you're going first and you're answering on a contemporary novelist to date ian mcewan has published ten novels so that's excluding collections of short stories and screenplays and we're excluding his work as well for children you have thirty seconds to name as many titles of ian mcewan's novels as possible and your time starts now
atonement saturday amsterdam childhood in time um black dog yeah black dog enduring love um

you got seven i'll give you the ten so you know what you missed the cement garden oh the comfort of strangers the child in time the innocent black dogs enduring love amsterdam atonement saturday on chesil beach well done now here's wendy and giles's list we're going from a contemporary novelist to a nineteenth century poet john keats' most famous works were perhaps his odes and he wrote ten of them that is ten works that have the word ode in the title if you're under any misapprehension i want you to give me as many odes by keats as you can in thirty seconds your time starts now
ode to a grecian urn ode to melancholy
it's on a grecian urn nightingale ode to a nightingale
ode to the ode to

there was a point when i went ode
road to wigan pier indeed the road to welville by t. coraghessan boyle
concerned which breakfast cereal tycoon giles
kellogg indeed the breakfast of champions is a novel of nineteen seventy three
giles kurt vonnegut which nineteen sixty nine novel by vonnegut has as one of its themes the firebombing of dresden anthony slaughterhouse five yes slaughterhouse five has what subtitle taken from an ill fated crusade of the year one thousand two hundred twelve anthony the children's crusade the children's crusade was the subject of a novel for children giles roger lancelyn green no by which prolific author who died in nineteen sixty six only miranda and anthony
oh is it rosemary sutcliff no it's henry treece
henry treece's poetry was published by which company boasting t. s. eliot on its board of directors wendy
faber and faber yes faber and faber
why could the company name faber and faber be considered misleading wendy there was only one faber that's right thomson and thompson spelled giles
oh georges remi
hand this straight over
hold on it was his initials backwards that gave him his name
no it wasn't great answer but it's not what i'm looking for
what was his middle name it recalls the protagonist of shakespeare's the tempest have to hurry you prosper indeed it was the tempest is shakespeare's only play to be named after a weather condition which is his only play to include an animal in the tile giles

takes place in a wood outside the city
that's probably midsummer night's dream it is indeed
it's your bacon ration for the week so you may as well enjoy it
the course of the next few years may well decide the future of civilisation for decades or for centuries
oh you lucky people
this is your victory
i can only tell you that an enormous mass of of work
we want clement we want clement we want clement
clement attlee's labour party won by a landslide churchill much enjoyed mocking attlee a modest little man with much to be modest about or an empty taxi drew up at the house of commons and attlee got out but churchill wasn't laughing now
nor shall the sword sleep in my hand till we have built jerusalem in england's green and pleasant land
clement attlee was one of only two prime ministers who really changed modern britain the other was margaret thatcher and there the comparison ends attlee was a quiet humdrum fellow a public school educated times crossword obsessed old fashioned do gooder of the very best sort everybody who really knew about politics knew that clem was just going to be a stop gap even some of attlee's own m. p.'s thought he wasn't up to the job immediately after the election victory they poured in here from all round britain to this hall at westminster for a victory celebration and as they were gossiping in the corridors and toilets swirling around exchanging campaign stories a plot developed it was to hold a leadership election get rid of attlee and put in herbert morrison now herbert was a wily political operator experienced minister very popular in the labour party so what happened to the morrison government of nineteen forty five too late herbert even as the m. p.'s plotted to get rid of him attlee and his wife vi were pootling quietly in their modest little car to buckingham palace and there a mildly surprised king george the sixth duly handed him control over britain and its sprawling empire
hooray hooray hooray misery's on the way there are bad times just around the corner there are dark clouds hurtling through the sky
britain didn't look like a glittering prize a quarter of a million homes had been destroyed in the war factories were clapped out or shattered and the people grimy and tired as they waited for the armies to come home civilians crowded into the dance halls and cinemas to escape the chilly boredom of everyday life
there are bad times just around the corner
clement attlee had won a huge parliamentary majority by promising to build a country of fair shares for all where the sick jobless old and poor would be taken care of attlee's new jerusalem had been planned here in old blackpool during the war an army of evacuated civil servants furiously typing away in four hundred hotels and bed and breakfasts created what is still the core of britain's welfare system the man behind the plan wasn't a socialist at all he was a puritanical liberal called william beveridge
i hope that when you've been able to study the report in detail you'll like it that it'll get adopted
william beveridge got up every morning at six for an icy bath and then he spent the rest of the day wallowing in cold statistics he believed in hard work and clean living for everyone but also that anyone who was genuinely in trouble because of sickness or unemployment should be helped this was the poetry of fairness
want must not be known again idleness there must be no mass unemployment ignorance said sir william no democracy can nowadays afford disease the evil of disease must be overthrown squalor no more generations must be stunted in squalor the beveridge report shows how to begin overthrowing the five giant evils and inspires us all to greater effort
i do happen to think that the only sort of nationalism that's worth a damn is cultural nationalism and i think that should apply to films we wanted them to be absolutely rooted in the soil of this country
oh how i loathe adventurous minded boys
the attlee government was struggling to pay off britain's debts by exporting most of what the country produced this didn't leave much in the shops and the age of make do and mend was getting as bizarre as any ealing comedy
all these hats are made from rugs and carpets so if you've got any old bits of axminster wilton bukhara or even a spare bath mat why not cut 'em up and be in the fashion
by now rationing is biting even more tightly than during the worst days of the war here's my quota six ounces of butter sugar a very small piece of cooking fat a meagre piece of cheese one egg two pints of milk a piece of meat that's barely larger than an i pod and by now never happened during the war even bread is rationed this is perfectly sufficient for a meal it would get you by all right for a day but this is my ration for an entire week and rationing goes on and on meat is still being rationed in nineteen fifty four
that's your ration for the week there's no more is this all that's the lot what am i supposed to do with that what you like
could you say a few words for movietone news
no i never say any words
the living symbol of attlee's austerity britain was the stern figure of sir stafford cripps former marxist christian vegetarian president of the board of trade and all round pain in the bum
like the family housekeeper i often have to refuse you all sorts of things i know this christmas won't be a luxury one and that you housewives are going to have a hard job making a christmas show i know you want to hear the truth i only wish i didn't have to say no
oh yeah well i'm not moving anyway i beg your pardon if the nazis couldn't drive me out of my home with all their bombs you don't catch me packing up now
here here time and again ealing films catch the political moment with uncanny precision
fancy a nice bit of bream for your supper
there was a growing rebellion against rationing and the endless no of sir stafford cripps and it's captured in the best of all of them passport to pimlico it's a fantasy about a few streets in london that declare independence from the rest of britain
blimey i'm a foreigner
burgundy burgundy
to great celebration rationing is brought to an end by the new breakaway country of burgundy
come to think of it i shan't need this any more either
that's the stuff scrap 'em all
the people of pimlico rip up their ration books and gorge themselves on black market goods
lovely black market butter
in the line please madam
the government tries to starve them into submission but ordinary londoners come to the rescue this wasn't just glorious ealing fantasy a real revolt long forgotten with striking echoes of pimlico was under way all over britain people waiting for homes had lost patience with the government flouting the law they simply seized any shelter they could find
and i felt if it was right for animals to be put in it was much more right that homeless human beings should have them we take the view that any right minded men would agree with the actions our desperation forced us to take
the great squatting revolt came to a head on a wet sunday afternoon in september nineteen forty six when here in kensington high street about one thousand people suddenly converged most of them were young married couples with children and babies most of them were carrying suitcases but this was a highly organised operation the london communist party had seized the issue and from here right the way down to nearly at buckingham palace empty properties were duly broken into and taken over
what sort of accommodation did you have mrs. barnes
i had one room with two families four people in one room yes sir for a pound a week that seems rather much it do sir
at first the response was almost hilariously british the police decided the best thing they could do was make all the squatters a nice cup of tea outside the houses crowds formed human chains to pass food and cigarettes and chocolate and blankets through to the families inside the press was broadly sympathetic students marched through the centre of london in support of the squatters in fact although this was entirely illegal the atmosphere in the country was cheerily sympathetic ealing perfectly captures this classic british tension between order on the one hand respect for authority queuing fair shares for all and a turbulent bubbling up demand for the good life on the other now in passport to pimlico right at the end austerity britain wins out
we're back in england
but the film also reminds us that britain can be a rowdy nation which won't be pushed too far and attlee's promises of jam tomorrow were wearing thin
one little bit of steak on friday and blimey we've had it for the rest of the week then
good god what does a man live on eleven pence of meat disgusting
we feel that the prime minister had led us up the garden path
brooding from the side lines as the crisis deepened winston churchill observed that labour's insatiable lust for power was only equalled by their incurable incompetence forced into opposition he had retreated to chartwell his home in kent but in march nineteen forty six churchill made what he called the most important speech of his life well there are a few to choose from but this was different it was made in the presence of the american president truman and it echoed immediately across a divided world
from stettin in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the continent behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of central and eastern europe
churchill was warning the west of a new tyranny just as dangerous as the nazis but he also made an equally significant private statement while travelling on president truman's train churchill turned to the president great britain has had its day he said now america is in the ascendancy this is the nation of the future and i would like to be part of it he went on to say that if he had been born then he would prefer to have been born an american blunt stuff it would have shocked a lot of people back home but coming to terms with that loss of status that bump down in the world has been one of the most important things we have had to learn in the modern world and giving up the empire was where this all that had to start britain couldn't any longer afford its imperial pretensions clement attlee knew this and indian independence was now top of the government's agenda churchill ever the imperial romantic had spent decades doing everything he could to hold india inside the empire in the middle of the war he said i did not become the king's first minister to preside over the dissolution of the british empire but attlee was determined to cut the knot millions of britons shared churchill's deep sadness that the empire they had created and fought to defend was now crumbling when churchill presented his final speech in the indian independence debate he said it is with deep grief that i watch the clattering down of the british empire with all its glories many have defended britain against her foes none will defend her against herself on the fifteenth of august nineteen forty seven british rule in india finally came to an end after nearly two hundred years
at the stroke of the midnight hour when the world sleeps india will awake to life and freedom
the price of independence was the partition of india into separate muslim and hindu states it would lead to terrible violence and the greatest forced migration in history up to sixteen million people were uprooted from their homes no one knows how many died in the chaos some say as many as a million the attlee government now began to try to establish new relationships with britain's former colonies all round the world and it passed the british nationality act which gave absolute rights to come and live here to more than eight hundred million people from all round the commonwealth it seems astonishing now but at the time it passed almost entirely without comment no one imagined that people from africa asia and the west indies would ever be able to travel to britain or that they'd want to but in the years ahead this single generally forgotten piece of legislation was going to reshape modern britain as the winding up of empire began attlee's government was also pushing through radical changes to british industry small signs sprang up on the gates of every coal mine in britain announcing they were now being run on behalf of the people manny shinwell one of the veteran socialists in the cabinet was leading the battle to nationalise the coal industry the conservative press was bitterly hostile
if some of the newspaper proprietors and their editors and the writers of leading articles aren't satisfied with what the miners are doing we're short of labour let them come and dig some coal themselves
there is still no break in the cold spell heavy snow showers have affected rail traffic blocking them completely
on the twenty third january britain awoke to what would become the coldest winter of the century
icy winds heavy frost and quite a bit of snow real austerity weather
for three months the coal waiting by the pits had to stay there frozen and buried one by one the power stations began to close within a week two million people had been laid off new jerusalem ground to a miserable halt even the americans noticed
england today england caught in the cold grip of economic crisis the sea frozen for the first time since nineteen twenty nine is symbolic of england's ever present gloom here with compressed air drills parsnips are harvested and here on this frozen island a little piece of coal becomes of great importance
as the crisis grew attlee's government was drawing up secret plans for dealing with mass starvation and here are those plans they were declassified in nineteen seventy eight and they've been described as the most alarming economic file ever written in post war britain not surprisingly they talk about going forward with a famine food programme about the need for military style conscription to work the land about bringing fifty thousand children out of school to take in the harvest there's a handwritten note here by a senior civil servant with the file which says the situation being considered was so desperate that any delay might exhaust the few remaining resources that might help us to survive the medieval threat of famine was avoided but the country was exhausted this wasn't the end of labour's new jerusalem but the great vision was badly knocked about
i'm leaning on a lamp maybe you think i look a tramp
these were boom times for an ever expanding black market illegal street dealers these famous infamous spivs were feeding britain's growing urge to forget the regulations and get its hands on life's little treats
i promise you there's a watch in every packet what about you
there is no whisky
yet again michael balcon's ealing captures the very moment when the nation's mood changes enough of rationing and time for some of the fun that the spivs seemed to offer
i tell you we're nowhere near any island
whisky galore was based on the true story of a wartime ship full of rationed whisky which runs aground off the hebrides and is promptly looted by the thirsty islanders in real life the ship was called the s. s. politician here it's called the s. s. cabinet minister but the story's pretty blatant
once you let people take the law into their own hands it's anarchy anarchy yes
when the authorities try to seize the whisky back they're bamboozled outwitted the puritanical state is beaten at last it's completely clear which side we're supposed to be rooting for britain was ready for good times whatever the government thought sometimes the revolts were started by the most unlikely people when a young french designer called christian dior unveiled his new look in the spring shows in paris women were delighted by the invitation to turn their backs on clothing coupons and whitehall approved fashions the voice of official britain was instantly dismissive
the new line is called envol or fly away all very charming but i should think it would fly away with your money and your coupons just look at the amount of material in this one
a junior minister at the board of trade called harold wilson joined in the debate his wife mary sitting silently by his side
i'm sure all the ladies will understand that the longer you have your skirts the fewer there'll be of them
tinned they tried to persuade people that it was delicious in salads or sandwiches or pasties or even as snoek piquant served with spring onions and vinegar and syrup in truth snoek was a vile disgusting mush eventually the government gave in hundreds of thousands of tins of snoek were sold off as fish bait or cat food you could push the british people only so far and snoek was further than that and there was more trouble ahead the financial time bomb attached to the government's hard won loan from washington was about to explode attlee's chancellor hugh dalton now had to suspend those exchange controls which prevented people from taking more than five out of the country there was a rush to buy dollars and the pound tumbled a severe blow to british pride and one that also made imports even more expensive so good times were yet again postponed the government was in chaos the chancellor hugh dalton was seen charging around westminster high on benzedrine and covered in boils exclaiming why can't life get better it wasn't as if the government hadn't tried to make drastic savings with the economy in crisis and the empire shrinking even the royal navy was being ripped apart eight hundred forty of its warships were struck off the navy list now this was an extraordinary thing entire fleets shrank and then they vanished individual vessels were broken up for their steel or they were towed out to sea and used for target practice and sunk or they were sold to rival navies many of them were mothballed that is they were wrapped in plastic and then left to rot by nineteen forty seven the mighty british home fleet had a single serving battleship left britain was a country whose power whose sense of herself had come from the sea for hundreds of years these were dramatic cuts but not dramatic enough the new burdens of the cold war were stretching the economy to breaking point in an act of desperation the foreign secretary ernest bevin brought things to a head he told the united states that british troops would have to be pulled back immediately from greece and turkey where they were fighting communism soviet troops were poised to extend their control to the mediterranean italy and france were said to be on the verge of going red now at last washington began to take notice the americans devised a uniquely generous package of economic aid for europe it was called the marshall plan and it ignited the fastest period of growth in europe's history britain got the largest share just like nato established soon afterwards we were trading succour and security for national independence but perhaps we had no choice as ernest bevin said of the marshall plan it was like a lifeline to sinking men
the minister announced today that the british standard of living has improved and that this improvement is due primarily to the generosity of american aid through the marshall plan the americans had saved us from financial disaster at the last minute
and attlee's government was able to deliver its most enduring achievement the one thing it's really remembered for
on july fifth the new national health service starts choose your doctor now
is it possible to carry on modern treatment in a hospital like this where to reach the operating theatre a serious case may have to be wheeled across a bridge in hail or in snow
now attlee's vision of jerusalem was finally about to become real aneurin bevan architect of the national health service set out to create a single centralised british system free to all but it wouldn't be built without a fight many of the doctors who were after all independent professionals unconnected to the state saw all this as socialist tyranny a power grab and that was a problem because no doctors no national health service the doctors organised an offensive against the government
we all want better health services and better health but in organising them let's make sure that your doctor doesn't become the state's doctor
mr. bevan would you care to say a few words to the newsreels
don't make fun of the festival don't make fun of the fair we downtrodden british must learn to be skittish and give an impression of devil may care to the wide world
it was always an odd idea here were high minded politicians and modernist designers trying to cheer up a country by now hungry for basic consumer goods
grab the travellers' cheques my lads and play
still over eight million people thronged to see britain's brighter future a world of science and progress but scratch that surface and it was all just a little bit dodgy the festival proudly show cased gleaming new steam engines the french rail system had gone electric a year before
we've never been exactly keen on showing off or
and then there was the skylon an impressive piece of futuristic engineering with no particular purpose suspended without visible means of support people said not unlike the british economy itself
we'll pay for the festival of britain
people did enjoy the festival but it turned out to be labour's goodbye to the country for a very long time
we have but to castaway by an effort of will the enfeebling tendencies of socialism and then to stand erect once more and take our place among the great powers of the world
attlee's vision of a new jerusalem was finally rejected at the polls in nineteen fifty one and replaced by winston churchill and his government of national nostalgia despite labour's reforming zeal many of britain's old hierarchies and traditions remained entirely intact the debutantes continued to be presented to the queen the grand gentlemen's clubs went on serving their turtle soup and venison and even the greatest public schools had easily survived the socialists back as prime minster churchill returned to his old school we in this small island he told the boys here at harrow need to make a supreme effort to keep our place and status the place and status to which our undying genius entitles us but what was that place all of his life churchill had been dominated by war preparing for war fighting war but by the mid nineteen fifties he had an acute sense of the danger of imminent nuclear conflagration and his last personal crusade was an attempt to bring russia and america back round the negotiating table a final surprise from the old man for a short period winston spencer churchill became the world's leading peacenik criss crossing the atlantic churchill seemed to have a greater grasp of how the atom bomb had changed the world than anyone in washington but in the end the americans ignored his pleas for talks with russia he came home with little to show for his trouble
we have not entirely failed nothing comes before the true and lasting friendship between britain and the united states
so much for britain's special relationship with washington there was no place for britain at the top table any more but we still clung to the glories of our imperial past
in hyde park they salute the new queen elizabeth the name that once before spelled glory for britain
the new queen set on fire churchill's always highly coloured sense of history elizabeth would go on to reign for decades as a centre of continuity when everything around her was changing but for churchill she was the change and her coronation represented the end of the old puritan commonwealth of the labour years and the beginning of restoration restoration of the empire an age of pageantry a national optimism in which churchill could wallow in place of attlee's new jerusalem churchill offered the new elizabethan age the nation reborn attended by great adventurers composers sportsmen artists and scientists the empire would arise in newly democratic clothes as the commonwealth australia and south africa were marketed as part of a golden future a kind of british california now within reach of a bright eyed new generation
it's easy easier to travel now i shall go everywhere i shall see every kind of people how they live how they bring up their families'
the coronation also kick started the proper arrival of television in britain it was a great patriotic event long live the queen advance britannia well maybe but television was also part of a new consumer revolution not yet properly understood
these high button boots of gran's were all right in her day but they're too old fashioned for today's modern woman she wants the newest the latest the smartest that's what she wants in a cleaner too
britain's leaders still hadn't come to terms with what people wanted most comfort and pleasure today not tomorrow brighter kitchens not the british commonwealth
and hollywood excitement not increasingly twee ealing comedies
i say is this a normal hazard of railway travel
the man who'd tried to build our british national cinema left ealing in nineteen fifty five he put up a modest plaque at the gates of the studios here during a quarter of a century many films were made projecting britain and the british character
i ask from you all for support through difficult years for the great era which is opening before us
tonight the stig tests a tube train richard tests a pair of shorts and i try my hand at running thank you thank you hello hello and welcome welcome welcome to an award winning top gear yeah we've got a gong for best factual programme which is astonishing when you think we haven't actually put a fact in the show for the past five years no matter we're kicking off tonight with richard not in shorts he is in fact in an aston martin
one hundred yards ahead turn right turn right
well done well done so er so a couple of weeks ago you lost against the eurofighter but now you've been able to beat a german with bunsen burners on his back yes i have
but only just and that's the thing about this car it's just not quite as fast as it looks and sounds like it's gonna be
it's the same story with the hard top you think i'm going a million and the speedo says you're doing forty three
but ultimately be honest do you really care about the speed because you're in a convertible aston martin and there's no better place to be you're thinking am i in the post office queueing no i'm in a convertible aston and it's brilliant
i would rather be in this than in keira knightley
i wouldn't
and now the news this just in from keira knightley she says she's disappointed but she understands anyway on with road safety news swiss researchers at a university have found that young men drive faster when they hear masculine words some particularly dangerous words they've identified are muscle and beard
what they drive faster when they hear those words yeah
but the interesting thing is hold on a minute
if i hear the word lipstick i just assume my dog's got excited again i have to say though this would be brilliant next time he gives us a lift and we want him to speed up i. e. always we just sit in the back shouting manly words at him
and then when we want him to slow down we use feminine words pink fluffy joking apart i think this is quite interesting
but i think the reason that i tend to drive maybe a bit too slowly is that i'm always thinking about the john lewis kitchen department
because i think we can improve this with an old top gear prop
what old top gear prop hang on i'll find it
you're an old top gear prop
him ship it back to england haven't you yeah i have
it's coming home are you going to live in the country together
embroider church kneelers are you sure this isn't just the typical holiday romance
when you were out there you thought he had a lovely moustache but get him home and he'll be horrid richard
he only wants a british passport yeah
and he loves me and he's coming home that's a fact aww
i'm going to be sick
look at him there he is he's on a boat right now as we speak i know no you're not offloading him bristol and i know when oh god
anyway let's move it on shall we go on yes now you may remember the first programme of this series
when we went over to europe and drove all around the place to find fabulous driving roads in those lightweight supercars and we heard from a chap who did the same we'd said look do it it's brilliant and a chap did and he's sent us his holiday photographs here he is on the first day of his trip at the stelvio pass where we were with his lamborghini and he also sent us a photo of how it ended up on his holiday here it is the thoughts he's having about top gear now are not generous
not good now the police in hampshire are running an advert of a jolly policeman in his tall helmet on the back of a bus we've got it here it's fine except for where the bus's exhaust pipe is
there's his no oh that poor man imagine driving behind that there's me there's my small metal penis he will be the crossest policeman in the world if you get pulled by him it's bad news if you get pulled by him for speeding
don't say aren't you the one with the exhaust pipe for a penis
minicabs wanna know why yes
because if you register your car as a minicab you don't have to pay the congestion charge
but yeah but hang on how much does it cost to register your car as a minicab
but hang on you don't actually have to use your car as a minicab
well they're gonna say are you a minicab driver yeah we're gonna test you do you know where you're going no you are then
do you have to have a pool of sick and a beaded seat cover in your car to qualify i hope not because first thing tomorrow morning
they're getting an application for a lamborghini gallardo spyder minicab
i look forward to falling out of a kebab shop and vomiting in it
i vomited in it just now so it's very appropriate
i'm allergic to bill oddie will it stop him getting in
bill oddie cannot be blown through the filter vents at you the filter gets rid like it it's very good it's also got hypoallergenic seats that give you eczema no
chlamydia no
no they stop your eczema and it's got a deodorising roof lining
a ha i was reading about that the other day if you break wind for instance in that car the smells are absorbed into the roof lining it's true honestly
it's deodorising that's what it does so the seats absorb your eczema and the roof lining absorbs your farts which is very clever but you wouldn't want to buy one second hand would you no
and burst into life
hang on to generate enough down force to get round a corner you have to go really fast yes
the thing i like is that it is amazing that this is allowed there's a regulation that says that headlight has to be that height they have to put the seatbelts in but there are no laws governing how fast it can go no
and we must now find out how fast it can go round our track which means we have to hand it over to someone who understands down force some say that to unlock him you run your finger down his face like that and that if he were getting divorced from paul mccartney he'd keep his stupid whining mouth shut all we know is he's called the sting and he's off little bit of wheel spin there now he's heading for the first corner fairly fast should be just enough down force to get him round look at the speed he's going the tail kicked out a little bit it's snaking now he's got to build up the speed again he's got no stereo today so no self help as he turns into chicago running a a bit wide the under steer kicking in not much he can do about that now back on that three litre engine into the hammerhead turning he's gong to be in serious bother here under steer again then over steer then under steer then over steer now he can get back on the power this will be phenomenal to follow through three g. through there easy peasy getting on for formula one levels of grip that's quick now he's got more bother again cos he's got to go slowly for the second to last corner turning in held that one very nicely last corner again running wide and across the line this is despite the handling issues we are expecting this to be pretty fast mixing it up here with the top crowd the one hundred eighteens the one hundred seventeens the one hundred nineteens it actually did it in one minute ten points staggering absolutely staggering
that's the fastest thing by miles and now i am going to take it off again what
you know the rules james if a car can't get over a sleeping policeman it can't go on that board we've always said that and look at the nose on this you'd rip that off if you ran over ghandi so sorry about that and now we're moving on because it is time to put a star in our reasonably priced car my guest tonight is a very busy man so busy that the only hole we could find in his diary was two weeks ago so we interviewed him then and then we thought we'd slide it into tonight's programme and nobody would be any the wiser i've had my hair cut to match i am wearing roughly the same clothes we're in the same building it was all very ambitious but as is so often the way with top gear i am afraid it hasn't quite worked because if you watch very carefully this poppy is about to magically disappear ladies and gentleman from the past simon cowell welcome back
how are you how are you very good thank you have a seat
not your first visit of course
i was here was it four years ago yes when we had the suzuki liana
we've moved on now oh you've really moved up in the world absolutely and so have you because then it was pop idol wasn't it yes second pop idol and since then you've got american inventor british inventor
american idol x. factor how many more opportunities are there for you to get money from phone lines
where people vote on things
we only do the phone lines so the audience can vote so we're giving something back to the audience
you can do an illegal immigrant one a what where people compete for a british passport
are you seriously pitching me this idea
i am thinking i might do it it's such a good idea
it's fantastic it's yours
yeah yes why are they clapping
come on fair's fair
this is your audience isn't it i can really tell that
we've got to help a poor struggling programme like x. factor cos you've nearly got as many viewers as us
no we get more than you
sorry ours is a better programme no it's not you reckon there are similarities between top gear and x. factor
the panel are similar i can see similarities in the panel james is louis
in so many ways
richard is dannii small but cute without the knowledge and i really do mean that by the way i tell you why i say that anyone in this audience could do what you do which is sit in a car and go i like it i don't like it you've never made a car i talk about music but i have actually made it happen
that's right you did the mighty morphin power rangers
doesn't matter zig and zag very good leona excellent
yes top of the charts oh wait we haven't heard a word from her
jeremy in case you haven't been watching the charts she is number one in the charts this week she's beaten take that and britney spears she's selling hundreds of thousands of copies of records beating who everyone
take that britney spears wow
you are being so obnoxious
you are call me obnoxious yes yes i am staggered
anyway my point is that the similarity is that we are both quite outspoken but i am the one with the actual knowledge
i'm sorry mate i'm we touched on this last time you were here about musical taste mm yours is terrible
it's not actually could i be a judge on x. factor shall i tell you why you couldn't why because i am ageing quite well and you are not and i thought about you the other day i was reading one of your reviews about a jaguar about how jaguars have to update themselves over the years
and you are the equivalent of a jaguar who needs help in other words you know how you do a facelift on the new jag
oh i can't do a facelift
no you do you need botox you need a facelift just have half an eye done or something
i look in the mirror and just go no i'm falling to pieces and i don't care
no i don't think that you care i think i look good
you do look good but i know i do and we're the same age and i don't care you must do should i care about it
no that's why you couldn't come on my show
yeah the second reason is you'd be funnier than me that's why you'll never come on how's america is it going well i like it there i've been there five years it's fun
that is brilliant isn't it
well it's very interesting i was driving the car the other day and i was thinking about what you said on the show about it being better than a porsche
the reason it's better than a porsche is that people like you in it i promise you at that split second someone overtook me put their hand out the window and went tosser at exactly that moment perhaps telling you to put your seatbelt on
that's all it was just put your seatbelt on
meet her friend let's be having a look
yes actually it's kind of pointless why because you can't drive these things properly
what can you drive in london that you derive enjoyment from
that's my point nothing you've still got the rolls royces yes
one there one here thanks to fifth gear who recommended it
i like westlife one of louis's isn't it no one of mine actually aren't they the irish ones
who isn't signed to your record label
the spice girls
i like them
i want to hear about my lap really yeah
oh all right then are you a competitive man
yes the last time you came here i won
you went to the top of the chart absolutely and then you were knocked off by jimmy carr wasn't it
who i saw like weeks after who was horribly patronising about the whole thing
so today's the day you've come back to see if you can get to the top
yes of the board that's why i'm here
how did it go
i don't think it went as well as last time who'd like to see it yes
play the tape
what did you think of the car terrible
that was seriously the worst car i've ever driven
that's good and aggressive through there
a little bit of wheel spin through there and into the hammer head nicely done so far that's pretty good
is that good yeah very good right now flat from now on here we go
flat yeah and still flat that's how you do it jeremy i know i drive round there all the time i know look at this casual relaxed coming up to the second to last corner
whoa here we go and across the line not bad
because you did it in one minute forty five you're there you're there been waiting for the day
that's fantastic
and gordon ramsey has just committed suicide wow
to be fair to gordon ramsey he's fat so that's worth at least two seconds that is amazing that was actually
you really do have a knack for it the stig said you have got a knack the cameramen said they'd never seen consistency like it in the practice laps
you should never listen to what you're being told because it's like riding a bicycle if someone tells you how to do it you start thinking about too many things so you've just got to get yourself round but i'm genuinely thrilled i'm glad i came
i'm very glad cos i was getting bored with having a scot not only in number ten but also at the top of our leaderboard ladies and gentlemen simon cowell
i'm so happy well done
wow what a night the records are just tumbling first the caparo blitzes the koenigsegg round the track now we've got a new fastest lap it's yeah hello my poppy's grown back
it's a miracle you are such a clot i am and now it is time for one of our epic races you know the sort of thing where a bugatti races across the alps against a truffle or a mclaren mercedes races a powerboat to oslo
oh yes and this one isn't that big to be honest but it is more relevant because it's a race to find out what is the quickest way to cross a busy city car bicycle public transport whatever
we've chosen london we start from kew bridge which is the most westerly point of the north circular which if you live in nepal or coventry is a sort of ring road around london and we then finish up over here at london's city airport which is at the most easterly point of the north circular
so that is a race right across the centre of one of the most congested cities in the world now to make sure that we aren't accused of bias towards the car it will be driven by the slowest man in the world a man with no known sense of direction him
and i shall attempt to beat him on this it's a specialised series limited a carbon fibre super lightweight bicycle it's built on a five piece construction with a body geometry saddle it's got carbon fibre cranks air carbon fibre handlebars carbon fibre brake levers and it's even got its own unique gel based suspension system so it can cope with the bumps of london
it's one thousand seven hundred it is quite expensive yes
anyway this isn't just a race between a car and a bike cos we need to see how public transport will fare so we need a third person someone who's never been on a train or a bus someone who doesn't know the misery thankfully we have just such a person
now as we race across london in the car and on the bike he will catch a bus around the corner then he will get an underground train to monument station and from there he will get on the docklands light railway which takes him to the airport are we ready
yes ready
let's go excellent oh hang on
hang on there is a fourth way
oh god
don't tell me a jet pack
no harrier jump jet no plasma powered horse no i've got a boat how will you get a boat up knightsbridge i'm not the river thames is just up there it goes all the way to the airport like a blue motorway
so you are going to row up the thames doing one mile an hour
it's got an engine all we know is this hammond it's eight hundred thirty two yes on a monday morning
i honestly think i can win this one
captain slow was also full of hope this is a car
this is a car programme i know you want the car to win i want the car to win i shall not let you down i have a rough idea where i'm going i know the river's on my right no it's on the right
bye bye good luck on the bus
meanwhile the stig saw a huge red car approaching and he got on it using something called an oyster card which is useful if you have no understanding of money
i'm in a bus lane which is good i can use them however the other thing that uses them buses the monday morning rush hour was slowing james but i couldn't open up the big lead i'd hoped for for one simple reason i've got to wait at the lights i'm on telly i always wait at the lights hello oh
with the car pottering along nicely i decided to see if hammond was as comfortable as me hammond
hello hammond
now here's one of the big problems that you have on the river which is the rowers who reserve a special kind of hatred for people with engines on their boats they are the cyclists of the waterway the hammonds do you want a lift see she hates me
change change i'm bloody cycling it's hard work
you can go faster cos you've got bandy legs
i can't go faster i haven't got bandy legs
it was time for the stig to get out of the big red car
ladies and gentlemen please keep your belongings with you
since i was stuck at nine and almost certainly last i decided to revive the ancient art of using a telephone while driving james hello captain clarkson where are you hammersmith yeah hammersmith broadway no way where's hammond i tried to ring him
but it sounded like his face was rubbing along the road so he may have had it already
james i have to beat you but i want you to win with that car don't get lost
to make sure i didn't get lost i was using the sat nav
keep left then keep right i know
i'm keeping right i knew that i was already keeping right
please keep left in one hundred yards'
exactly you go down there towards
my phone's going hello hammond
how's it going mate
oh no no
oh that was the sound of a skull under a bus's pirelli right time to ring the stig see how he's getting on we'd given him a phone but er after twenty five minutes this is how things stood hammond was alive and in the lead may was breathing down his neck in second the stig was third and i was going in the wrong direction on one of the river's endless and annoying meanders
i have to make every mile an hour count because my average speed is so low don't pull out don't pull out don't pull out i hate buses stinking horrible things
the next station is stamford brook
the stig now in an underground car have noticed that everyone was doing the same thing this has to be the most stress free and relaxing monday morning rush hour commute since the dawn of civilisation
oh not another set of sodding lights oh bloody hell have a nice walk enjoy yourselves i knew may was getting stuck at the lights too but getting up to speed again didn't wear him out not that he could get up to any sort of speed in the first place
now i'd never try to ban people from having cars like this cos that would be like communism really but i really don't understand why anybody would have something like this for driving around town because it's so big and unnecessary it's more than six feet wide it's almost six and a half feet wide and that's what makes a difference that door is half the width of that whole scooter
meanwhile the stig was plainly bemused by a strange new world
hammond
hammond's stopped swearing long enough to answer the phone hello
i'm just coming up to the albert hall i wondered how you were doing
you're just behind me i'm stuck at the lights again ooh right
i'll give you a friendly peep as i go past i'll kick the crap out of your car if you do
thirty five minutes into the race and richard was still in the lead james was still on his tail the stig was still in a tunnel and i was still following a path forged by nature at nine but i wasn't worried at all hammond by now will just be bathed in sweat he is smelly people will vomit when they go near him james of course he'll end up in huddersfield perhaps pontefract who knows not the city airport er stig don't know might think he's a brazilian electrician and then me having a lovely time and i'm going to win
i was now scything down piccadilly and joy of joys the traffic was horrible
as it turned out jams were the least of my problems oh crikey it's the rozzers the police only wanted to check the permit for our camera car but it still cost me valuable time so on the basis that stopping here i've lost about three or four minutes in the race and that sort of corrupts the result can we just do four minutes of blues and twos and i'll follow you
i was pulling further ahead cycle lane one two three metres of it and then i'm back under that bus
with plod of my back i now had to pay ken livingstone for permission to sit in his jams
i'm sorry that was an incorrect connection
hello i need to pay the congestion charge for london
erm er fifty fifty six hotel foxtrot zulu
and is that a mercedes g. l. five hundred in silver how did you know that
it's actually a fifty five litre but they call it a five hundred cos they're a bit embarrassed about it oh
hammond hello where are you i'm on the river i've just got onto embankment
where are you i'm just going past fulham football club this was bad news jeremy was now only about a minute or so from wandsworth bridge where he could put his foot down so although the car was imprisoned by the traffic the boat was coming into play and stig was closing in too
please mind the gap between the train and the platform
i've got nineteen miles an hour showing on the little speedo here i've got to keep that up i feel sick
here we go
got to beat jeremy and cannot be beaten by james
battersea power station ladies and gentlemen to your right coming up to milbank now headquarters of the labour party they won't like this very much ha ha
i don't like this car to be honest it's not my kind of thing but a car is nevertheless the right way to do this i've got it just set to twenty degrees bit of radio three
yeah pull out on me why not that's what i'm there for
the stig in a close second was now making his final train change
ladies and gentlemen please keep your belongings with you at all times and report any unattended items or suspicious behaviour to a member of staff or a police officer
hello officers i just went past the police at forty five miles an hour annoyingly i couldn't fully open the taps because weirdly i had traffic problems look at it just endless tourists
come on i've gotta get my speed up
this train's ready to king george v. via london city airport
twenty twenty five twenty eighteen so frustrating
it's jeremy on his boat where where where
tower bridge going through as the river widened i became the fastest moving man in all of london we're mucking on now coming up to fifty miles an hour how could we lose now it simply is not possible
yeah yeah
at this stage james was last and the stig was still several stops away from the airport so it was becoming a two horse race the bends in the river had made my journey seven miles longer but i was now doing a whopping seventy miles an hour hammond was probably feeling quite good about his chances well i'm sorry mate but they're gone now thank god
bloody lights bloody lights hate them
london vts london vts this is jeremy requesting permission to go through the barrier at speed
proceeding through the barrier take charlie's fan in between the green arrows'
sorry
somewhere around here there's an airport and i've gotta go report at it
city airport there it is come on come on
come on i'm here i've arrived coming through
unfortunately a gentleman on a bike has checked in already
what a gentleman on a bike has checked in already hammond yes
i'm better than you
how the hell did you do that it's easier on a push bike you don't get stuck you've ruined top gear
well it's the last ever show i've bent it a bit hang on you're saying i've ruined top gear because i won on a bicycle yes yes you came second in a boat between us we've ruined
we've ruined top gear we sat down to see if top gear could be salvaged just so long as the car beats public transport what if the car that we've got that's a good point what if the car loses to public we need for public transport to come stone dead last we soon got an answer here comes
oh no did you go on a tube underground did it go dark flashing lights
there'll be a bit of smoke coming out the top in a minute keep watching
fifteen minutes after the stig james arrived thank you james what have you done the car as an entity ruined lies smashed and broken in front of us because of you he'd beat you on public transport
we're ruined can i clear something up it's just confusing me here because you lost about four minutes with that policeman business but watching the film you get the impression that the car arrived fifteen minutes after everyone else now if i remember rightly when i got there james you were already there and had been for ages he was
do you know something else as well i distinctly remember my boat blew up and i was killed yes yes you don't get that sense watching the film doesn't come through
i'm glad you said that because i remember cruising past hammond with his head stuck in some railings that happened that did happen
do you know what london doesn't have a river so i couldn't have used a boat so there we are what top gear which is a trusted award winning factual programme has proved is that despite what you've just seen in that stupid and misleading film the car was the fastest
and the best yes and the best
good evening and welcome to have i got news for you i'm kirsty young in the news this week in glasgow the government announces an official one p. cut in the price of deep fried mars bars as the b. b. c. sells the format of any dream will do all around the world the albanian people name their joseph and at the white house shortly before a crisis meeting to discuss global poverty there's a momentary distraction as an ice cream van goes past on ian hislop's team tonight is a comedian and author whose series of james bond novels concentrates on the character's school days at eton though so far there's been no mention of bond's obedient fag buttocks galore please welcome charlie higson and with paul merton tonight is a comedian who told the daily record recently i don't spend much on clothes i find that if i keep wearing the same clothes all the time often a t. v. company will buy me some new ones not always though eh please welcome frankie boyle in round one we cover the bigger stories of the week ian and charlie take a look at this
that's all the money left in the bank of england
that's the prime minister or it was at the time of recording the housing minister
that's a car alan sugar's car that's not alan sugar
no that's brown firing himself
hopeless you deserve to have it taken away
stealing money from the poor correct and giving to the rich
a sort of robin hood in reverse
robbing the country
very good
do you ever get the feeling the cameras are pointing the wrong way
i like the way the guy who came out in defence of the poor was quite a camp actor sort of a camp stealing from the poor
why has he done it now darling what that bloke up there oh
why has he done it now darling yes
no why has he done it now darling
doesn't make it any better in fact it makes it even more alluring perhaps
are you saying why darling done it now yes there's a by election coming up indeed which traditionally is when you throw money at the electorate crewe is a traditional labour seat it was gwyneth dunwoody's seat her daughter's standing hereditary principle we're all tories now so you just give the seat to your children but unfortunately the tories are there and they look as though they might win it
we also in the film saw caroline flint she had a spot of bother this week what was that
she walked into ten downing street carrying a list of the things she was going to discuss but she had it in a clear folder so the press could photograph what she was going to say
and the line on the top said the housing market's going to fall by ten per cent at best which is shocking because it's a minister going into cabinet with something that's the truth
she's something of a fashion icon isn't she
she is she's a sort of government totty
only you can say that yes
government totty no i can say it as well
in these belt tightening times any of you aware of what's making a comeback
poverty
it's frozen food that's actually making a comeback sales are up did it ever go away was there a point when people said
are you exaggerrating for comedy effect
no not with this audience
the caroline flint folder that was blown up by the newspapers to detail what was on it somebody else also came a cropper with that
hazel blears yes also had a sort of clipboard with all the answers on it someone had proposed and she was going to take it into cabinet that gordon brown does a reality show for children like a boy prime minister or child prime minister yes and gordon brown would get popular by being a bit like alan sugar so he's going to grill children and then fire them and also if you choose a quite competent eleven year old they're going to run the country pretty well
he's got to go for broke he should have a sex change operation change his name to janice and we'll be so amused by that he'll win the election but he's got to have a high pitched voice wear a dress and a funny hat
and be called janice janice hazel blears' special adviser said
that's it aim high this half hour operation
he could be back in the office by midday janice he'll set it up next week i thought you were thinking about it
no i'm waiting for you to shut up
i would but it'd never work
this is the week in which gordon brown was forced to perform a u. turn over the ten p. tax rate labour is handing twenty million people a tax giveaway of one hundred twenty it might not seem much but by the end of the year it will be enough to buy a house for next week's by election gordon brown has done all he can to help labour win over voters in crewe he stayed well away one recent poll revealed which david cameron celebrated with an extra fine cuban cigar and a chilled bottle of dom perignon sixty three paul and frankie here's yours
this is er
absolutely over seven thousand reported incidents that's quite a lot yeah what did fisherman alfred burtoo claim happened to him unexpectedly in aldershot
he woke up in aberdeen
his statement claims now here's albert's sketch of the spaceship from the national archives
the why bother files yeah
that's a clue check with the pilots they might have seen something
there was a guy in wales who said he saw a white blob that made no sound which was basically a sheep in the distance
the mod there's a good one where they saw these weapons of mass destruction in iraq
this man was on newsnight i want you to watch and tell me why
he's a prince philip lookalike
he's a morris dancer
he's called doug bower and he was responsible for perpetrating a hoax
is it crop circles it is ah him and a friend dave i think the other guy was called and they admitted back in ninety nine that they'd done the majority of the crop circles in the summer
and on this particular occasion an mod officer was sent to do research and he wrote in the files so let's take a look at how doug managed to create them then
doug bower and his mate dave made the crop circles for a laugh with a plank how bored was doug
has anyone seen what's been flying in the skies over switzerland
it's not that rocket man is it it is oh yes fantastic
took him five years to perfect it and here he is yves rossi
look at that he hits that mountain
he's test driving it for the new ryanair cheap flights
now what has darth vader been doing in a back garden in wales
nothing he's a fictional character
didn't he attack someone there was a jedi wedding i haven't made this up and someone dressed as darth vader objected to it
some guy who'd had a few dressed in a bin bag purporting to be darth vader interrupted a light sabre fight not a wedding between two members of the church of the jedi
aaagh darth vader darth vader's here now
ow that kind of hurt
he's not looking good is he
that's why he never usually takes his helmet off
they called the police and soon enough the force was with them i know it's not my fault it's on here
no we were laughing at the idea of the police turning up
this week the government released documents about u. f. o. sightings in britain in one incident and so to round two the picture spin quiz fingers on buzzers ian and charlie
a new survey by scientists has said sloths are not at all lazy they get up pretty early they do a decent day's work then in the evening they lie around and everyone says look at you lazy things compared to a human teenager these guys are energetic
and how did scientists find this out
they watched them instead of listening to ill based rumour
they put little tiny caps on the sloth's heads yes to monitor brain activity so even if they weren't doing things
they were thinking yeah that's what we all say
it sounds to me like it's just confirmed the reputation they had you can't work out they're energetic because they don't take a cap off it can't surely be the definition of energetic how's grandmother oh you wouldn't see her these days she's magnificent she took her cap off today
next they'll be telling us that cheetahs are really slow
rabbits they don't reproduce at all
nah most of them don't like sex
never hate it
i've tried everything barry white he's been buried at sea has he
that would explain the rising tides we thought it was global warming didn't we
fingers on buzzers teams paul and frankie children are being tested too much
specifically the tests or teaching towards tests means that people aren't properly educated i hate to
agree with the government but they're right on this there you don't fatten a pig by weighing it all the time
and you don't seduce a cow by buying it chocolates there's wisdom in these old country sayings
that would have been a much more interesting piece of research yeah
let's do that what's the latest technique used in the north east
for helping children to pass exams
they're telling them the answers yep but in a silly geordie voice so they don't get them all absolutely right
apparently they're telling them facts for eight minutes then having a break letting them play around and telling them the same facts again the technique is based on new research by an american neuroscientist and presumably also by the schedulers at sky news here's a question from a recent exam f. o. r. eleven y. e. a r. old s.
twenty eight
yes
my brain goes funny as soon as you start reading that stuff if there's fifteen apples and a bunch of grapes how many men does it take to run a bath from here to newcastle the answer's sixteen inches i've no idea what you're talking about
i hate the whole thing as well of sports science now as a thing sport isn't a science that's what stephen hawking brilliant at science
rubbish at basketball exactly although he's getting better he's practising on the subject of poor exams
there's nothing wrong with that that's exactly where it is
it's not the wrong answer that's thinking outside the triangle exactly
here's another one
yeah expand that's great on the subject of quizzes and questions
former conservative party leader michael howard and his wife sandra have been married for thirty three years they both admit to crying at soppy films and coming to blows over games of ping pong
which of these is most likely to rouse you in the night is it snoring yours or sandra's is it getting up because you need a wee or is it your cats prudence and martha nuzzling up to you
it's the second getting up and needing a wee it is oh
he wanted to run the country who has the ugliest toes and who's the best kisser they were other questions michael howard has got the ugliest toes apparently it was her i see she's got ugly toes and he's the best kisser
how can they tell unless you kiss a third party the joint kiss together she might be pulling her weight and he might be riding on the energy of her kiss but saying you are a terrible kisser i'm offering to judge
she she has got the worst toes but he is the best kisser yeah
well i withdraw my complaint shall we see another political couple
till i saw her standing there oh yes i saw her standing there oh cos i saw her standing there
that's got wait till i get you home written all over it
i think i'd keep my own name if my husband's name was balls what was her maiden name she might have been called sandra bollocks
it might be a step up for her look at it from her point of view
and he has got the ugliest balls
in a week where schoolchildren are taking exams school testing has again come under fire according to the telegraph at monkseaton school in tyneside the school is now top of its local league table though sadly only in basketball here's another one
this is the man who was caught driving the car with a child in the back she wasn't wearing a seatbelt but his beer had a seatbelt stopped by police was it in australia it was
how did the motorist react when he was pulled over in the outback
this is fifty eight per cent volume mate
according to constable wayne burnett the man couldn't see what he'd done wrong the policeman said
what was a south african policeman doing in australia
they move around a lot these days
the australian man denied that his life is ruled by his obsession with lager though he does have four x. wives and a foster child that's comedy isn't it that's the first decent joke we've had
on autocue for about five years only kidding
right fingers on buzzers teams
cherie blair has published her autobiography and it's been serialised in the times i think i haven't seen it and she's got into trouble some judge has said you can't say this you should be thrown out of law and she said i don't care what you say the only reason the book's come out
is because they think brown won't be prime minister soon and then no one'll buy it cos there's no point buying a book saying isn't brown awful if he's yesterday's news so it's greedy and opportunistic
having spent the whole time she was in downing street defending her privacy rigorously she suddenly realised that if you give her one million it's less private so she admitted that they conceived their child leo at balmoral
was it under the table during the dinner
she said she didn't take her i'm quoting directly now contraceptive equipment up to balmoral
that's an inflatable priest you're not meant to do that you're not meant to do that
there are so many fascinating facts that have come to light thanks to these books that we're gonna have a quick quiz within a quiz
ooh blimey
what did cherie call the queen ghastly dreary
dull she really didn't like her at all very approachable yes no she's dead
seems unfair to hold it against her though
she said to the queen are you looking forward to the olympics and the queen went no i'll be dead by then that thing that grandparents used to do my grandparents when you were leaving you'd go see you next year and they'd go we'll be dead then i find it quite humanised her
i think that was just your grandparents
my grandparents were spectacularly miserable still they're dead now
did it change their mood at all no
she said i'm not comfortable with that it's not the way i've been brought up right
she'd been brought up not to call people by their real names
that seems bizarre doesn't it
i have to call you eric
what did cherie say that gordon brown used to do the whole time when they were neighbours
is it spy through a hole in their bedroom wall
she says he rattled the keys above his head yes
was it metaphorical keys rattling
yes but then what does that sound like it wouldn't bother me if someone was metaphorically rattling keys
it can be very loud
i'd be watching a sloth not putting the cap on what according to cherie is vladimir putin's basic rule on women
does he like big knockers
his view according to cherie is
he's not exactly
what on earth is that
has he just slapped her or something
he's hypnotised her with an invisible budgie sitting on his finger
what did carole caplin say to bill clinton when they met at chequers
take your hands off me
easily believable but no cigar you need to remember
i'm tempted not to say it now
go on
shall i pretend
yeah moment's gone
shall i just no
sorry charlie you were gonna say
and amp
yeah what do you mean you just reacted to the light didn't you
i'm pavlovian you're worse than a moth
that's a terrible insult to a woman you are worse than a moth saunter by an electric light and go your own sweet way moth woman
what
you've lost interest in this quiz
save yourself woman i cannot control the beast within
carole caplin said to bill clinton according to cherie they're all at it cos lord levy has been hawking his book around anyone see him make a very peculiar noise in front of andrew marr
no no please
i never met gordon once during that time but if you were the leader and gordon
this is the publication of cherie blair's memoirs some people had described cherie as being her enemies have been somewhat harsher one of the pivotal incidents in cherie's husband's premiership was the suicide of chemical weapons expert doctor david kelly cherie writes in her new book serialised in the times every day this week
i think it was in the vatican where tony was very upset he'd heard doctor kelly had died and she said don't worry you're a good man you did the right thing though it didn't turn out so well
no laughs but there we are well there you go
you've got to sneak a bit of politics in on this show i think
keep it credible eh
no just sneak a bit of politics in gotta have achievable goals in this business
what's fleming
this year's his centenary
who's this nathan b. stubblefield is he a hundred
he looks about a thousand
yeah we'll go and play basketball for fifteen minutes
so who's your odd one out
the odd one out is the umbrella cos it's not a person
the man smoking a pipe is one hundred years old this year the umbrella is one hundred years old this year ian fleming was born one hundred years ago and that bloke is the odd one out
thank you
what about the bloke with the pipe
that was joe drew who celebrated his one hundredth birthday with a pipe of his favourite tobacco erinmore which according to a pipe tobacco reviewer tastes like juicy fruit chewing gum another reviewer said it was like don't say a word why might mr. greg's brolly have come in handy
it was raining last week
he was sprayed with the contents of a toilet by a passing train whilst out walking his dog patch
how close was he walking his dog to the train line
he says patch and i have been doused twice in a fortnight and it's spoiling our day out the answer is they're all celebrating their one hundredth anniversary except nathan b. stubblefield although he did patent the first mobile phone one hundred years ago stubblefield was also responsible for the first ever comment made on a mobile phone i can't talk now i'm on a penny farthing according to his biography stubblefield having signed up for vodafone talkplus paul and frankie your four are ben turpin knightsfollie ladiesman ilja gort and the cast of last of the summer wine
i'm thrilled to see ben turpin silent screen comedian there's only about seven things anybody knows about him and one is that he had his eyes insured in case they uncrossed that dog has probably had its ears insured cos they are unusual last of the summer wine can't get insurance because of their age and they're filming outdoors so they're the odd one out i don't know about this bloke on the left he must've insured his beard last of the summer wine can't get insured they're the odd one out
you're right with the odd one out but the guy with the beard
his nose yes he's a wine taster
no perfume taster wine tastes perfume
oh that's delicious this one's great
ilja gort recently insured his nose and sense of smell for three point eight million
brilliant what does his insurance policy not allow him to do cut it off with a knife he's not allowed to box that's right
he's not allowed to box or breathe fire he can't work as a knife thrower's assistant obviously he can't become pregnant or commit suicide and the basset hound knightsfollie ladiesman
who is his famous relative
david niven sorry is it related to a prince charles spaniel
it's actually biggles the face of hush puppies shoes you said the odd one out is the cast of last of the summer wine they want to bring in a youthful edge to the cast so they've signed up russ abbott who's sixty stringent insurance rules make it harder for veteran performers to remain on television one eighty year old who insisted on remaining anonymous said it's not nice that the industry's so prejudiced that the industry's so prejudiced it's not nice according to prince charles last of the summer wine was the royal family's favourite t. v. programme apparently the queen mother used to fall about before they took the bottle off her and sat her in front of the telly time now for the missing words round which this week features as its guest publication cow management magazine not as successful as bull management which is of course in a field of its own
that's the second good joke in seven years a bit of a run of form

you can swim along together
don't call me burbot i wasn't brought up that way
the evolutionary origin of the burbot is uncertain but many scientists now believe it was due to a typing error doris lessing has complained that since winning the nobel prize for literature she's been unable to write she said in an interview with the sunday times and here's the photo that went with it doris lessing is recognised as a pioneering feminist it's thanks to her that i can be on a show like this as the token woman
the answer is parish council member alma harding told the boys to take their ball to the nearest playing field or as it's now called tesco's

some things
junior
welcome to this week's comedy map of britain i'm alan whicker at the tiller of titillation as tonight we wander the humorous highways of east anglia we'll be seeing where one old man first got his grump
i did loads of wacky stuff and in many ways i was a prat
where mock the week er mark watson first trod the boards
i had a hole in my lung and i ended by saying i can feel my lungs filling up with fluid so i'd better go which is not a line i've been able to use since
david and jimmy looked at each other and said if this lot can get on we've probably got a hit
our first stop tonight is norwich and the university of east anglia where a young lad called brian smith from south london arrived in seventy three he knew that if you wanted to make it in comedy you needed a memorable name syd little eddie large engelbert humperdinck
students at the university of east anglia have admitted responsibility for an elaborate practical joke played on people living in a broadland village thirty five students claiming to be government scientists questioned villagers and issued leaflets warning of the dangers of touching the animals
have you seen any dead coypu in this area within the last three months no i haven't
a spokesman for the students said it was a rag stunt and they were sorry if they'd caused any alarm
it was in the local paper and then it made the national papers i think it was in the telegraph and the guardian and it was a great hoot although alas not as far as the local council were concerned who got very annoyed and upset what did i care i was twenty and i was being ridiculous as you must at that age
and are singles doing well yeah
terrific course there's the new video really pleased with that yeah
you had a few problems with the last one
yeah we think this one's much better
more current you know
don't clunk click just yet as we're staying put at uea and heading to the lower common room to play tribute to two other comedy alumni who met here fortunate for us too because if higson hadn't met whitehouse there'd have been no ted and ralph no ron manager no swiss toni indeed no fast show
i'd like to you to an old friend of mine beg your pardon clive tucker now now clive's brought in for us today some lovely old carpenters' tools to look at
hello bob i must say it's nice to be here arse
we met in nineteen seventy seven in norwich at the university of east anglia
nineteen seventy seven
yes we were both punk rockers student punks
howard hughes did he steal my bongos lee harvey oswald did he steal my bongos the freemasons did they steal my bongos
who stole my bongos
right this is the lcr and this is the social centre of the university of east anglia and this is where i booked the higsons the social secretary charlie higson had a nickname of switch which i'm not quite sure what it refers to what do you call yourself
i call myself switch i was young hey i had bleached hair
he was known universally by that name if you mention that everybody'd know who you were talking about
first time i saw charlie higson we were all queuing up to get our grant cheques and he had a self administered mohican haircut i seem to remember not the sort of person you would approach necessarily this is where the higsons played their very first gig and just behind me was where i think we had our third or fourth gig the first time we ever played i don't want to live with monkeys i've had this scrapbook since nineteen eighty one the cover is actually a poster of our first single i don't want to live with monkeys which is a cartoon done by charlie and he did all the sleeves actually apart from one two tone single has photographs of very early rehearsals bit from the phoenix magazine which was the uea magazine which charlie used to do a cartoon strip in pictures of us with dodgy haircuts in scamps nightclub in norwich i have been to the brink of death and back in a nine car pile up on the dual carriageway going to the brink of death and back in a nine car pile up on the dual carriageway is very much like making love to a beautiful woman first of all brace yourself hold on tight particularly if it's a rear ender and pray you make contact with their twin airbags as soon as possible picture the scene paul my horn is jammed on all i can see is a volvo coming at me at one hundred twenty miles an hour my god i thought now i'm going to eat volvo
charlie's between song banter was quite deadpan he would come on and say good evening we are the higsons you are the audience this is our first song
i'm just a young boy i'm trying to get ahead you say i'm a young man but hold me back instead when it gets like this it goes right to my head sometimes i think i should stay at home in bed
he'd go thank you this is our second song and just numerically until the drink overtook him which was about song number four
girl girl girl you gonna set me on fire my brain is flaming i don't know which way to go your kisses lift me higher like the sweet song of the choir you light my burning sky with burning love
no trip to east anglia would be complete without a nod to one of the most famous sons of norwich not bernard matthews alan partridge but alan was fictional though that didn't stop some of the locals going off him a bit
and alan partridge the comedy character who boasts of having the third best slot on radio norwich has upset norfolk's civic leaders they say steve coogan's creation is turning the county into a national laughing stock
a detective series based in norwich called swallow think about it no one had heard of oxford before inspector morse this will put norwich on the map
why would i want to do that
yeah fair point
there is a view held that the partridge effect was negative to norfolk and i think mr. partridge shall i call him could have done a lot better for norfolk
with the melting of the polar ice caps most of east anglia will be underwater in the next thirty years so make the most of a stunning fens before the floods come causing a little concern for these local farmers i chatted to ah try pedestrianising this
partridge you wanker
ah
i think he gave the impression as though we were an uncultured load of country bumpkins'
we'll dub that out play some music over it
there's a lot more to tell in norfolk if he'd only get good scriptwriters to do so scene thirteen take two
one of the benefits of global warming and international terrorism is that more and more people are holidaying in england i'll drink to that
i didn't think the programme was funny at all it tried to promote people of norfolk as being dim witted i don't like him i think he's missed a huge opportunity to promote the city of norwich and norfolk in particular
well i think there were mixed feelings you can say the conservative view was that alan partridge wasn't a great thing for norwich he was knocking norwich somehow but i think for most people they really enjoyed the show alan partridge was very funny hello commuters with your computers this book would fit ideally into an attache case or the thigh pockets of a pair of fashionable combat trousers which what what is it you want
train for lowestoft
seriously run you will miss it i don't think norwich is really the butt of the joke it's about the shallow content of dare i say it the graveyard shift on local radio
i heard your phone in i liked your chat with the guy from swaffham he was wacky
yeah yeah he was i actually think he was a bit simple
heard you laying into the criminals again alan the vandals got to your car again
fraid so third time scum sub human scum
from around the ring road to around the globe this is nine hundred ninety nine radio norwich
initially when i told people we're working for radio norwich the perception is it will be alan partridge style a bit tin pot radio but actually as we've proved on air with the awards that we've won and our shows it's nothing like that hope you're well this morning ninety nine point nine radio norwich in the next hour we'll send you off to the movies movie tickets up for grabs in the five second flick we did get in touch with steve coogan when we launched radio norwich we grabbed him with our microphones and he recorded us a really good alan partridge good luck message
this is alan partridge saying good luck to radio norwich
which obviously we were immensely proud of at the time really good for him to do that for us more about this year's lord mayor's procession we'll be a big part of that when i first got my job here i'd just bought a building plot to build my own house which is of course exactly the same as alan partridge do be a radio norwich eye witness steve bradley is living in a caravan and working at radio norwich one of the biggest songs from the nineties is next so i guess there is a similarity between me and alan yes
anyway thank you very much for being this morning's farmer sorry about that robert a bit slow on the uptake there don't know what he had for breakfast presumably an infected spinal column in a bap
as we're at the station we'll let the train take the strain and head out to the coast and great yarmouth home to not much besides myleene klass and the humble fish finger we're stopping here because a comic once did his bit to save another piece of the british way of life and restore the pier
yarmouth's wellington pier was built in one thousand eight hundred fifty three and it was to honour the duke of wellington and the shows moved off the beach they moved into theatres and this is one of the first theatres built in the country to house these shows well jim davidson had a very interesting relationship with great yarmouth he was here as a kid he started then to become a t. v. star and started doing shows here he did a season for me at the royalty down the road and then during that season he actually in secret bought the wellington pier from the council to have a major star like jim davidson a big t. v. star actually putting his hat in the ring with a town like great yarmouth's been fantastic it's been such a great publicity thing he mentioned it it even became part of his act
they have something in ipswich you can go back two hundred years in one hour the road to great yarmouth first of all when you go up there you've got to talk properly you have nearly got it but you've still got that little bit of element of the british language still in you haven't you
i think jim bought the pier because he's always been a performer and it's human nature to want to get on the other side of the footlights become an impresario and i think once he did it he found out how difficult it was which is what i've told him all the years that i've known him that it's not easy to try and make money in a short season
the only time we'll close will be february we'll run a panto a gang show lots of rock and roll bands to classical music we can do the lot it's a theatre for yarmouth someone should have done this work on here twenty year ago and it wouldn't have been so bad just gone down like that hasn't it
jim was very active in the refurbishment of the complex and he was quite capable on a paintbrush and would often be with the lads painting the theatre out
someone said to me i know why you're doing this cos you ain't going to make any money yarmouth's gone right down the pan and you're only doing it so everybody think you're a hero fair one innit the amount of work to be done i didn't know the place was such a dump to tell you the truth look at this that's rotten that totally rotten that is the truth but we're doing all that up bit by bit hacking away at it but it's costing a fortune
we've tried various ways to raise some money we've approached the lottery and i've only asked for twenty six million a couple of hundred thousand for the pier and the rest for my ex wife if they got eighty two million for the opera house they've got twenty six million to do this shitty pier up right folks
jim applied for various grants from the lottery and from the local authority and elsewhere but at the time i don't believe the political atmosphere was correct
and it's now dropped on my lap that we won't get the money and without lottery it won't get done will it
no
i haven't got any more money no i ain't
when i see the pier today i feel sad because i've lived in the town all my life and it's always been one of the landmarks and i hope one day that it'll be restored and can go back to its halcyon days i think yarmouth has got to say thank you jim davidson for what you've done for the wellington pier and what you've done for the town
fist of fun
the barren concrete city home to an unlikely cavalcade of wild creatures the urban fox the urban badger the urban hedgehog and the urban man the earliest recorded reference to urban man comes from the village of hoxne in suffolk in one thousand six hundred forty two to urban man a deserted garden is a fabulous adventure playground
we love having them in the garden they're very shy they come right up to the glass though they're cleaner than a lot of people we know too here they come now wanting for their supper look
this one's a funny one with the funny little nose
john paul george and ringo
twenty two miles south of hoxne is baylham where we're calling in to greet a real pig a berkshire sow actually who's sponsored by the p. g. wodehouse society which is enough to make any pig pompous
you interested in pigs i think you know my sow empress of blandings i believe you met when you were down here in the summer
disgusting
we're here at baylham house rare breeds farm near ipswich because at a recent dinner the p. g. wodehouse society presented its guest speaker anton rodgers with a year's sponsorship of patience who like wodehouse's celebrated empress of blandings is a berkshire sow
if you were to ask me what is one of the greatest honours of my life i think i would say being invited to be a sponsor to this magnificent beast here it takes the biscuit or carrot or bread whatever you want it'll take everything
from somewhere near at hand music made itself heard the servants' hall was refreshing itself with the housekeeper's gramophone pig i can distinctly call as much as that pig pig lord emsworth leapt in the air the peace of the summer night was shattered by a triumphant shout pig hooey wodehouse was unsurpassable as a writer of comedy great subtlety and yet the characters come alive when you read them coast clear your lordship coast clear commence the operation your lordship yes
commence the commence
i think she's getting a bit not enough close ups that's what it is you couldn't do comedy map of britain without wodehouse could you be impossible
aye mr. mackay
pick that up ives
with career criminal fletcher taking centre stage
come where the hands are clapping come where the toes are tapping come where the jocks are strapping down
fletcher sir
take one the film demonstrated that on the inside or the outside
no one delivered a gag quite like the legendary ronnie barker
if you can't read how do you know it's from the wife
it's got elaine's scent
oh dear where does elaine work the tarpaulin factory
sadly porridge the movie was the end for one comedy legend aged only thirty one richard beckinsale died just weeks after filming
yeah would be arms yeah
then there's lots of hugs and kisses nice letter
a few miles up the road from chelmsford is brentwood school where only one pupil ever got a perfect mark in english that teacher had a sharp eye for talent for that pupil was the splendid douglas adams who went on to write the brilliant hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
where did you get the idea for the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
drunk in a field in innsbruck i was lying there having had a couple of bottles of beer and staring at the stars and the stars were swirling around my head and i had a copy of the hitch hiker's guide to europe which kind of everybody was carrying around europe that year
here have a look at this what is it the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy a sort of electronic book tell you everything you want to know i like the cover
all i thought of was the title it occurred to me somebody should write a hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy as well it didn't even occur to me that it'd be me who'd do it it just seemed like a good idea
i taught here for thirty two years douglas adams was one of our many well known pupils this is miranda who used to ring this still is rung to summon the children to line up first thing in the morning and also for lunch makes rather a nice sound of course adams would have walked this way to my form room we only ever called them by their surnames in those days this is the quiet room through there was the boarders' playroom and this is the room where i taught adams english
oddly enough the one thing that sort of gives me confidence from time to time when i most need it is not anything to do with critic reaction i might have received or numbers of books sold or bestseller lists and so on but it's the fact that once when i was must have been about ten eleven my english master at my prep school gave me ten out of ten for a story and apparently it was the only time he ever did it
the answer to the great question yes of life the universe and everything yes is yes is yes zero point four two
apart from books and some letters i have one great memento of douglas my wife and i had a holiday with him at his lovely house in the south of france where he had a vineyard and from that vineyard was produced sparkling wine which he gave me a crate and this is the last surviving bottle and it's called as you see quarante deux
forty two
forty two the answer to life the universe and everything
shops have played their part on the comedy map but this is the first time we've taken you to the cleaners we're here with good reason as the proprietors of crown dry cleaning of billericay are responsible for ensuring that lee evans looks presentable for at least the first five minutes of any gig
our most famous customer would be lee evans he's been coming here for about ten years
he's a stand up fall over
you know it's it's stand up and run around a bit yeah his stand up has a lot more physicality in it
i shouldn't have a go at old people look at them in the town centre they walk up the street like that i'm fine i'm fine lee normally brings in six or seven suits and they are generally soaking wet very wet
very wet very wet normally we have to dry them out for at least a day and then we clean them properly the following day and then we have to clean them again just to make sure cos he does perspire quite a lot you sweat more than anyone else i think i've ever seen on stage your clothing it must you know i know i know i mean i do sweat
i mean i can't help it i take them into my cleaners and he's refused to clean them now
i gave him a credit on the video cos i kept going in and saying my suits are knackered he said i'm not cleaning them again you're an idiot you're ruining a perfectly decent suit he doesn't talk like that at all
i was wondering where that was meant to be
that was his wife that
not a very good impression
we have got some of lee's suits here oh there you are yeah they're due to be collected tomorrow so we'll look forward to that
a few more notches around the essex commuter belt and we're at laindon station where back in the days of steam a young girl who was to become a mistress of british comedy first started to create a right old carry on
this house behind us is joan sims' home she was born here in nineteen thirty where she lived with her family
my intimate friends call me ding dong
i'd like to give you a clang sometime
my father was a station master at laindon in essex
there wasn't much to do in laindon in those days she was an only child obviously so she had to find a way to entertain herself
i used to dress up from a very small age i remember and could often be found on the railway station sitting there in some eiderdown or something dress up as a lady oh isn't it lovely
why don't you try it on
can i of course oh oh this is fun cos i had no neighbours to play with i had no children to play with so perhaps that was possibly how it all happened what are you gawping at and i suppose really my audience were the passengers
may i say that you are the most ravishingly beautiful woman i have ever seen
am i really oh you mustn't desist here knock it off and i used to scrounge clothes and shoes from the passengers yes i used to eye their feet and i thought if that lady's got small feet i'll catch her tomorrow and i'd say if you've got any old shoes would you leave them care of the station master and my father used to get these various bits of clothing popping up and he used to get furious with me
joan would perform over here on platform three where she'd wait for passengers coming from london they'd either be popping to the countryside or going down to the seaside the passengers would get off she would entertain them
my lavender water please
yes my lady i'm afraid you've dropped one lady bagley
i beg your pardon
she was never worried about what they thought she would give them a show
oh yes of course
that's what gave her the confidence to become the real queen of carry on
that is a very big one you have there is it not mr. boosey eh
oh this yes well i'm going hunting i'll see if i can bag something for supper
i see game
any time you are
this is saint thomas' dagenham and this was where dudley moore was the organist and i was in the choir in those days we used to have two choir practices the tuesday one was for the choir boys and the thursday one was for the complete choir and that's the one dudley moore used to come along to absolutely terrific did you like it on this particular night for some reason i arrived early and there was no one in the vestry at all but i could hear jazz being played on the organ i thought this is strange so i crept through into the main body of the church and just sat in one of the pews and dudley was playing tiger rag now the organ's a very powerful instrument anyway but the church was vibrating to this sound it was absolutely amazing it was then that i realised that dudley was on a different level a completely different level
dudley moore is an entertainer he's recognised as one of the up and coming musicians of showbusiness
i wasn't very popular at school when i was young being a very serious boy and very hard working and it wasn't so much the desire to become popular as a desire to be less unpopular that made me start fooling around quite often a group of the members would come back to my home for coffee or cocoa or whatever and dudley was usually in the group and inevitably dudley would end up playing the piano it used to drive my father nearly mad because he would never finish anything he would get to a certain point in a piece of music and then he'd shoot off into something else because a chord sequence had brought something else to mind and off he would go and it did drive my father wild but i don't think he could help himself
that was dudley's humour well it was always laughter wasn't it really
i was in the bathroom the other day
course you were i remember that
hold on pete and i had the feeling of somebody in the room with me and i thought funny you know bathroom door locked you know funny somebody in the room funny you know didn't see no one come in i thought you know felt his eyes burning in the back of my head funny you know
this used to be the dagenham county high school i came here in nineteen fifty and it was my first post and i was the music teacher here and one of my very first pupils was a boy called dudley moore
i remember the old school hymn rise in the strength of god and the faith lights up your way with better hope and stronger will than in the past
the piano it was fifty six years ago when i and dudley first played it i'm afraid i must say about it that it has seen better days it was music of course that actually got him to magdalen college at oxford he was an organ scholar there and amongst all the things you'd say there's dudley the piano player the actor the violinist but it was the organ of all things that got him there so without that of course he wouldn't have got into oxford he wouldn't have had all the exciting things meeting peter cook beyond the fringe and all the other things that happened now mr. spiggott you are auditioning are you not for the part of tarzan
right
your right leg i like i like your right leg it's a lovely leg for the role a lovely leg for the role i've got nothing against your right leg the trouble is neither have you dudley and i kept our friendship i mean there wasn't much different between our ages and when he went to the states he suddenly became a hollywood superstar out of the blue he wrote to me and said let's be pen pals and i was a bit flattered i suppose in a sense but that's what happened and while he was in hollywood he wrote me some forty four wonderful letters i remember us playing with great pleasure an enormous amount of music together and maybe the fact that that we weren't too far apart in years made it difficult for us to be teacher and pupil i know some of your comments on my exercises didn't go down too well with me but surely that is inevitable in something as personalised as musical creativity it's not like chemical equations which are either right or wrong i'm not telling you anything that you didn't know am i
now is the time to say goodbye
goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye get off
now is the time to yield a sigh yield it now is the time to wend away until we meet again some sunny day
he'd go from great comedy to acting to jazz but at the heart is dudley's music
resisting the lure of london we're heading north to bury saint edmunds many a comedy caper's been built on a prize winning turn at the edinburgh fringe but few of those comics set out from a sleepy suffolk market town
please welcome the wonderful mr. mark watson
i was mugged in london by a kid it was horrible a lot of people are mugged by kids mine was really young like thirteen fourteen year old kid in a way it's nice to see young talent coming through
the fat cat comedy club had been pulling in regular audiences and l. w. t. wanted to put on this show which enabled local comedians to perform in front of people stand up britain was a bit like comic idol so that they were able to come up people rang in and voted them off and maybe if they were any good then they went onto the following heat if they weren't any good then that was it they finished
we're going to show you four acts from your area you vote for who you think should go through to the final
the atmosphere backstage was quite dark really there were people pacing up and down and reading their lines out getting very pensive
this was like a holding area ten of us basically had to stand here everyone was pretty nervous the backdrop to all this was that i had a lung problem i had a hole in my lung and i'd done the rehearsal earlier that day which i ended by saying i can feel my lungs filling up with some sort of fluid so i'd better go which is not a line i've been able to use since
now it's time for another comedian from your area
then with very little ceremony they just said right you're on mate does everyone know what sod's law is right maybe some parts of wales is it's the law that states that the worst possible thing always happens right it could have been worse the main thing is just wondering why i went for the hat why the hoodie i didn't ever do that again' sod's law states the worst possible thing in any case happens so here's a sod's law example do you put the washing out on the line if you put the washing out it starts to rain if you don't put the washing out someone in your family dies sod's law
after we saw mark we were expecting him to go on to greater things you could see that so let's go onto safe ground right the war
this war in afghanistan did you know right it's cost the british taxpayer one hundred fifty million quid a week each it's easier to watch yourself five years ago than yourself now cos at least with the separation of time you can pretend it was a different person
will this comedian make it into the final nope
before we go we've got to make one last call in thetford thetford was only noticeable as a birthplace of thomas paine author of the rights of man in one thousand seven hundred ninety one and defender of the french revolution then in nineteen sixty eight the cast and crew of dad's army marched in turned the place into walmington on sea and stayed for nine years that's three years longer than the war their home guard was supposed to be fighting
who do you think you are kidding mr. hitler if you think we're on the run
i realised when i first found thetford there were a lot of older type streets that wouldn't have screamed out to the viewer saying this wasn't nineteen thirty nine as it were i found a particular battle area which is very near thetford and that served a lot of location problems for us and altogether it was a great package and decided to use thetford as a base and indeed for us to stay at this hotel you see in the background the bell hotel became very important to dad's army and if you're going to stay somewhere for nine years obviously it is going to be
it wasn't nine years the bill would have been enormous no no the bell hotel was my first hotel i ever stayed in yes violin i brought that with me that there one two that was the first room i ever stayed in i remember david telling me that he and jimmy looked at each other after about two weeks on the first shoot and said if this lot can get on we've probably got a hit there'll always be an england
here we are on mill lane rather lovely we were all marching along here yeah and then bob raglan comes down there and pulls the string out of the proverbial trousers
we were about to film the bit where we find the grenade in the trousers and arthur walks up and flicks the script and says have to rewrite that not doing that and walked off and didn't want to do this scene didn't want the hand down the trousers so half an hour later arthur's waiting to see what's happened you know what are they going to do to accommodate him and they said gather round rewrites on the script all the speeches say mainwaring cross that out and write jones and that was the rewrite platoon halt
where on earth are you taking the prisoners
well captain mainwaring thought we'd go for a walk get some fresh air
they've been in a submarine for weeks
all right i'm going to the railway station to pick up the prisoners' escort i'll see you later
yes sir platoon i'm surprised at you mainwaring
your men are always so smartly turned out why isn't corporal jones wearing his equipment and what's this lump of string hanging down his back agh it slipped out it slipped out save yourself sir save yourself
hang on sir i'll cut it out no
who's in the army mr. jones no private rooms or telephones you had your breakfast in bed before but you won't have it there anymore heading somewhere private was very important for us filming dad's army because for a start we were filming something that happened thirty years earlier as it were so it was important we had somewhere we could completely take control and knew there'd be no cars or people that we didn't want in the background but also the great thing about stanford practical training area is that it had little remnants of normal village life around she had you worried but this is war and she won't worry you anymore
here hey don't blow it here come with me
my experience on dad's army is something i never ever forget the week off school the working with the stars and of course fifty which i earnt through the eyes of a fourteen year old things don't get much better than that
blow in here and i'll give you sixpence
go away boy
well done here you are
the first take we did was it just didn't quite go quite to plan and i was nervous and the bugle just squeaked captain mainwaring came out and he reassured me that there's nothing to worry about they all make mistakes and in fact i have a picture here of the very moment someone actually took while he reassured me back to do take two and it worked straightaway because of the equity rules i wasn't allowed to speak when i was given the sixpence couldn't say thank you
well done here you are
it had to be a total silent movie as far as i was concerned run rabbit run rabbit run run run
this is froghill where we did the closing sequence
that's right yeah coming up there
we'd finish filming that day and we'd got about twenty minutes and david decided to do it now by the time we got to do it the wardrobe van had gone back and my scarf had gone and i didn't have a scarf for my bit of the walking so if you look closely next time you'll notice that round my neck is not the scarf but a blue towel
not the one your mum had given you i didn't object to it
i thought it was just going to be for one episode it did another one hundred sixty episodes it's a living
that's all for this leg of our journey we're back again next week in the south coast with the league of gentlemen's steve pemberton
wandering round browsing laughing it just set her on edge she didn't know where to look
and alan davies who's also known as jonathan creek
that was it that's jonathan creek
i'm doing something i've never done before i'm gonna do it this time ain't gonna do it no more my alley boogie only thing i choose the only thing i do to drive away my blues so this is it then basically the sum total of our mortal existence day after day killing ourselves to stay alive i don't belong here i don't belong anywhere on this planet cos there's got to be something else hasn't there beyond all this or what's the point somewhere out there some force or power that guides our lives from birth to death perhaps somewhere beyond eternity an ultimate unimaginably infinite intelligence that defies all human comprehension
yes i'm here keep your shirt on before my knees give way completely you didn't think of making two trips just give me a hand
anyway how'd you get on then last night with my hot tip for the weekend the lovely roger daley
roger daley it wouldn't surprise me if you deliberately looked him up in a phone book
what do you mean oh right funnily enough that had never occurred to me actually
and as it happens i don't think a man who's about to have part of his brain removed is someone i'll be making another date with any time soon thank you very much
part of his what are you talking about
i saw it on his appointment card this thursday afternoon charing cross hospital
i mean i know he was going for a blood test or something but yes and the rest
in future if you could let me know which of your friends are complete headcases it would make life simpler
no really i'm sure he was going to have his cholesterol levels er you do know the difference mill between a phlebotomy and a lobotomy
yes oh good
spying on people through their windows
think again pornographic constellations i beg your pardon apparently every night he scans the heavens and joins up a load of stars to make dirty pictures he showed me one or two and i tell you what
you look a bit rough today ally did you have a bad night yes
since you ask i've barely had a wink of sleep all week now if anyone wants me i'll be in the canteen sorry but it's just starting to get to me i suppose twelve days and i haven't heard a dickybird
what from douglas since he went off to tuscany
supposedly to work on that film script but with that denise woman around i think i can assume the inevitable has now occurred
well haven't you tried ringing him cos i know there's no point
if he hasn't called by now and i suppose it's the simplest way isn't it in the end for these things to die a natural death to just let it all peter out painlessly
alice chenery that is completely insane you've got to ring him tonight the minute you get back and no more dithering
how we doing here ladies are these all dead
thank you james and how's things with you still banging away at the acting lessons you want to study drama you should come to our place some dramas go on there you wouldn't believe
oh really are you yeah few years off my first oscar but
and you know you're all very welcome folks to pop along to one of our productions if genet and ionesco are your bag
we'll let you know we're more dolce and gabbana
um yeah i suppose d'you think no no no you're right alice of course you're absolutely right i should that's so true try and look to the future
and you take care bye lloyd
i'm just gonna grab some takeaway down the road did you want anything
oh is it miss madison we've not yet met i'm anthony number sixty five we moved in last week i was hoping i might run into you oh hello we've seen you on the television many times but when we heard you were living next door my gosh
right
we were course no we'd be glad to wouldn't we
so how did um oh yes
a riding accident tragically four years ago before we actually knew each other her partner at the time once he became aware there was no hope of the nervous system repairing decided to move on rather disgracefully in my view but his loss was my gain so when the two of us met up through a friend of a friend she can hear you perfectly of course and her eyes are often more expressive than words can ever be you'd be amazed the complex thoughts she is capable of conveying isn't that right once you've learnt the language i was under no illusion when we got married what it would involve you know every morning washing her all over and grooming her from head to toe making sure she always looks her best knowing how terribly important that is to her every night undressing her gently massaging the tissues to prevent atrophy and getting her to bed it's the sort of thing you quite happily do and more besides when you love someone
how can you say it's touching it's sick touching her up more like god that was so bizarre
well i suppose you say that but
i mean for goodness' sake use your eyes alice he's obviously having a rare old time with his own personal blow up playboy doll what goes through her poor head i shudder to think with him mauling her body morning noon and night
you don't think that's being a bit cynical i mean i know that's like the obvious knee jerk conclusion to jump to but and of course you may be right or they may care very deeply about each other people surprise you in life all the time is it really for us do you think to sit here and judge them
yeah well thanks to him i've got cold chow mein and dry noodles so i don't think he's getting a christmas card this year
so you don't think there's any chance at all that she might
why would she alice you know it's like i had something so good there and solid and i just flushed it all away straight down the can how often do you learn those lessons too late in life i mean that's the real tragedy and so what are you saying you and douglas i'm afraid
the silence has been deafening
that's a shame i mean cos he was always no i mean no that's a shame
so snap
you want to know something really really appalling the other day when you called i was i was just about to hang myself
don't be ridiculous
i mean whether i ever would have you know had the stomach to but it was just like after all that and janey walking out on me what was my life worth
i did what no nothing no you were thinking something what
no well the way things turn out you just wonder sometimes
are we ready to order now
oh yes right let's order you see what i'm saying folks
oh god i do
now is that not a little bit strange or what
gives a whole new meaning to the word star fu no i better not make that joke had i
but it is amazing though when you actually stop to think about it
when you stop to think about what
well you know that all this is actually out there and he's managed to find it cos i mean you look back at the ancient greeks and everyone all they could see was a load of ploughs and bears
think i might just go and wash my hands you coming
what's this all on your own
well i suppose in a manner of speaking you could say that but what's new you don't want to hear about my love life
oh dear really no listen i've been through it that kind of pain it's not nice
sounds as if you've been on the receiving end more than once
once is enough i'll tell you now you know when you think if you're ever gonna meet that one person in your lifetime this is it and you just cannot believe things could ever be that perfect and that's how it was the two of us me and jenny and then it was like your worst ever nightmare you know she died in her sleep
oh don't no
i woke up in the bed and looked across she was just lying there eyes wide open but she wasn't breathing they reckon her heart had just stopped in the night no signs or warning of any trouble she'd never smoked or
oh that is just cos how do you ever get over a thing like that
you just have to don't you somehow but
and so when did all this happen
i suppose it must have been about half past six this morning cos seven o'clock you know she'd always be up and about and ready for work
this morning you're not serious this happened to you today and you're here
hello oh hello how are you
so how's your day been the usual glad to put it behind you i expect
i know i do wonder sometimes lloyd what kind of cruel joke is being played on me by someone up there for their own private amusement at the risk of sounding terminally paranoid
no i think i know just what you mean by that just give me two seconds while i open some wine
so what do you mean a wash out how could it be a wash out you'd got her all stoked up with a candlelit meal and music incense on the go it's a no brainer
i dunno cos i was playing it by your rules wasn't i you know that thing you told me when a girl says no she nearly always means yes so when i asked her if she'd object to me putting my hand down her jeans
and don't tell me she said no
sounds like you really nailed it
i'm not so sure and i tell you i'm not sure if all your female psychology is what it's cracked up to be if you want to know
oh god
what no that was like some strange out of body experience
as if i was back on the counter there for a minute it was just no anyway cheers
i'm a bit of a case study
well i suppose in a way but in the nicest way and what i'm gonna say to you is probably not what you'll want to hear but when you think we're only here together now because of him and knowing you now and knowing gil as i did i really believe somehow it would have worked out the two of you
it plays on my mind all the time i mean we only spoke to each other a few times i mean for hours on end it's like neither of us wanted to put the phone down but and obviously i'll never know now what was going through his mind i just know there was so much there i would have loved to share now i never will i mean the shock of that happening just from nowhere that day
he was being treated of course for high blood pressure but and how much notice do you ever take of that
you know and the heartbreaking truth that you can never bring them back
his diary
you say you'll never know what was going through his mind and what he thought about you i mean he was a writer you know that's where he expressed himself his thoughts and emotions i had no idea every day for the last twenty years
god it must be so full of i mean his family obviously should have this
and of course they will it's just i just know alice as much as i know anything in this life if all this was written for someone one day to read it was written for you
see you tomorrow hi hello just starting another shift
oh yeah hi how are you
oh i'm all right um listen on the off chance i might see you i didn't know if this might be of any use at all only it just i have to say helped me so much through both my parents and i just thought i mean obviously nothing changes anything it can't that terrible awful sense of loss it's like how can anything be right ever again but when it's someone so close i really do understand actually what you're going through at the moment because
oh dear i don't know what to say
i was just about to meet no i don't know what to say because this is
god i mean so sweet and thoughtful and considerate of you and the thing is i made it all up
my girlfriend jenny the whole thing about her dying in my bed she's actually in scarborough at the moment doing an alan ayckbourn it's just last friday night our drama tutor gave us this improv exercise we all had to work on over the weekend it's like we had to come up with this really dramatic emotionally intense back story of some kind and then present it as if it had actually happened to some friends or someone we'd just met or whatever and obviously the test would be whether they believed it
oh right so it was just right well that was yes very good
anyway bless you better get on then sorry about that
jonny where have you been i'm so sorry my grandmother's wedding ring and her grandmother's let's see stop
janet oh my god will you marry me

i am your prince here is my mighty sword
i've got news my life is in danger
my sister summed jimmy up to me the other day jimmy is every mother's perfect son that's how he was
jimmy died a day after his sixteenth birthday his first lottery ticket and went to buy a sandwich in this bakery police say he was challenged to a fight but he refused he died a victim of mindless violence a man has now been charged with his murder jimmy's local catholic church was full today so people had to listen to the service in the rain imy's parents were quite clear today was about the memory of their son it was not about getting angry it was not about getting revenge it was about forgiving
anger breeds anger and bitterness and bitterness will destroy my family if i'm not careful and i
of violence
his family say they will always remember their jimmy as an amazing character with a zest for life the husband of a television make up artist has been remanded in custody charged with hur murder the body of forty eight year old diane chenery wickens was found on thursday four months after she was last seen alive david chenery wickens who is fifty one will appear in court again in august gordon brown has described burma's military rulers as inhuman over their refusal to allow a large scale international relief operation to help victims of cyclone nargis a group of foreign diplomats was allowed into the country today to see the damage they said it'll take years for burma to recover jonathan head reports from bangkok to comprehend the power of the cyclone that struck burma consider there used to be a village here with three thousand inhabitants more than half are dead the conditions for survivors across the irrawaddy delta are still appalling this monastery is now sheltering dozens of homeless people on its own they haven't brought us anything yet we don't even have a roof says this monk but burma's military rulers want the world to see a different picture of smiling generals leading a relief effort foreigners and cameras are now now banned from the delta but one group of diplomats and aid workers has just been taken by the burmese military for a tour of the areas they say the destruction witnessed at the sites selected by the authorities suggest a huge international construction effort will be needed lasting years the prime minister described its refusal as inhuman
we have an intolerable situation created by a natural disaster it has been made into a man made catastrophe by the negligence the neglect and inhuman treatment of the burmese people
nobody could have predicted such
final such an extraordinary rematch winners of nineteen twenty seven against winners of nineteen thirty nine and portsmouth must have felt their chance had eluded them again when kanu sash shade through went through like ballet dancer only to finish like clog dancer kanu was to make amends soon after eventually portsmouth were able to run down a clock that had at any ticking for six years no wonder the celebrations were ecstatic not just at wembley but back home too
absolutely brilliant words cannot express it
what a beautiful day when sol campbell lifted the trophy he was also raising the expectations of smaller clubs everywhere the strongle hold on the cup of the premiership's top four broken
for everybody my family especially the fans the players it's great it's been a difficult year off the field so to come in now and win the f. a. cup is a dream come true for me
as a kid you watch the f. a. cup the one game of the year
who would have thought a pompey cardiff final certainly not the bookies
it doesn't roll off the tonge cardiff city in an f. a. cup final
people get blase every year chelsea arsenal man united but for people
we are not coming here to lie down we will come to have a go nothing will give me greater pleasure than leading the team out
that is what they are playing for as catherine jenkins sings land of my fathers god save the queen with lesley
i can't
believe he shot from there paul parry came in he has the pace he forced david james to advance
the ball was played over sol campbell david james did well because his starting position was seven or eight yards out of his goal and that made the difference otherwise that would have been touch and go for a penalty and all
sorts of things it is a pacy start a good start exactly what the game needs peter whittingham manoeuvred the ball well no free kick it was worth a try hreidarsson just made sure that whittingham was covered tony adams alongside harry redknapp who lifted the cup three times as an arsenal captain again paris made the forward and paris was in again for cardiff david james required again to and saved paul parry
with the outside of the foot not
with four three three as well you said kanu is isolated
portsmouth all sorts of trouble glen johnson has put the ball down waiting for hreidarsson and sol
campbell and distin the goalkeeper fumbled nearly for kanu that was a worrying moment for peter enckelman this is a better spell for portsmouth that was diarra peter enckelman will be delighted because he has got away with one no doubt about it there was little or no pressure on him and he just fumbled it very strange everybody helped him out in the end he should have just caught it l. don't know what he was trying to do
kanu could not turn it in
he went down early as though he had made his mind up what he was trying to do
big incentive today kanu brilliant well he did brilliantly didn't he that was the first time somebody had run from midfield it was utaka wasn't it it was a great ball in as well
won himself a free kick he caught
him no argument it was paul parry who dropped back and got the shot in everybody else
was in the penalty area he has lost it going back to the free kick it was a lovely chance for paris on his left foot paul
back forward every time we have had a good delivery from the cardiff free kicks just could not quite direct it on target not a great deal of quality from portsmouth so far mendez plane it wide to glen johnson enckelman punching away glen johnson's cross the decision before by enckelman to punt from the cross was a good one it was a good save lots of height and distance on it
kanu was there it is it given kanu and portsmouth at think they have taken the lead
they have it was a brilliantly worked in cross enckelman again punches away but connor was so close fantastic reaction by kanu
watch the assistant referee when the ball goes in he stops for a moment anyway it is a goal
no argument about that a lovely whipped in cross by utaka he is very quick kanu of
because of the wit here he decided not to shoot it was a good idea but the pass was a bit too quick for mcnaughton you can see why he did not shoot
because of the angle glen johnson a first touch let him down and then he committed foul
the ball was pinched away from him he was caught ledley
one minute will be added at the end of the forty five here for stoppages if cardiff are to have anything to show for this they will have to score pretty fast sol campbell not very happy with that free kick awarded and here is somebody else who is not happy hreidarsson
there is no doubt it hreidarsson is a free kick
the yellow card for hermann hreidarsson for dissent it it was not sol campbell glen johnson squeezed the ball out for pompey this is surely the last chance of the half it has been hooked back in no goal that one was wiped out no doubt about that
i think the
whistle went to his mouth straight away
the it was loovens it was away the dutchman loovens has not scored this season portsmouth the premier league side under harry redknapp have the advantage the goal scorer at thirty seven minutes was kanu cardiff city who started well go into the dressing room the championship side a goal behind paul parry their most dangerous attacker early on but at half time in the one hundred twenty seventh f. a. cup final it is zero to one to portsmouth cardiff city start the second half here playing from the right roger johnson to be marked by can't back by kanu to is gavin rae it is a free kick to cardiff joe ledley showing again what a clever player he can be
he has given johnson some problems today
that split second as it left kanu's boot it could have gone anywhere fortunately for cardiff it goes
had kept the ball ledley needed to wait a bit odd a little bit longer he had loads of time and there was no way that perrie could get round campbell in such short space of time
that is a free kick kranjcar has certainly come into the game he scored for croatia against england some of us will not want to be reminded about that
too late
anyway for would come campbell and
hreidarsson forward muntari with the shot peter enckelman was always in control of the situation once it left the left foot of muntari he knew it was dipping over l. was not quite sure myself
did that clipped the
he saved it it
was going in there there was a save yes as they line up for the corner hreidarsson has joined campbell and glen johnson johnson got up
if hreidarsson had had his forward head on he was just thinking as a defender and was caught on his heels if he had gambled he might have got on the
end of the knock back worth an effort the cross was cleared by distin for a corner ramsey has gone across to take it thompson was jumping and coming in
johnson and loovens
they have
robbie fowler he has been out with a hip injury since the turn of the year he was always pushing it to get on the bench today play up pompey the chimes have started again distin a great run what a goal that would have been
also a great tackle it was a brilliant run by distin when he first got it he did not have options so decided to go alone it was a brilliant tackle in the end
it was roger johnson who made the challenge but what a thrilling run from the centre back there is the ingrave there he has not started etching yet will it be the name of portsmouth for the first time since nineteen thirty nine can cardiff city produce something in the last couple of minutes that was a let off for pompey but look at the break i really thought ramsey might have pulled it out of the fire for cardiff portsmouth breathe a sigh of relief mcnaughton is injured he is hobbling back
maybe he has got cramp after that run he could not get up
ramsey had two openings
i thought he was going to shoot on
the second one it is a bit early to be doing that and cardiff have the chance to get the ball upfield mcnaughton just
cannot run there was a daft fouled by diarra
yellow card as well that has given cardiff a chance to really push portsmouth right back with one minute to go the goalkeeper is coming up enckelman
he is going to take it
what a finish this could be to the second half what a blog glen johnson a corner to be taken by ramsey it is a big finish by cardiff david james that was a great take a and portsmouth have won the f. a. cup for the first time since nineteen thirty nine and harry redknapp has led them into europe for the first time harry redknapp rules the waves in the naval town of portsmouth kanu the goalscorer
i think you will find he was waving to his wife very emotional scenes
well mark cardiff did their bit
most certainly
i think we can hear from harry redknapp a lifetime in the game how sweet is this moment
fantastic for everybody my family especially the fans the players it is great it has been a difficult year off the field so to come and win the
it is for all my grandchildren and everybody it has been a good day for them
you were like a cat on a hot tin roof at the end
late in the game you had to defend for your lives
we have done that in every game in this cup campaign we conceded one
he is a legend the first cup win in seventy nine years
this is a brilliant day the semi finals everything we work harder and harder yeah we had luck through the rounds but in the end we got the result
credit to your opponents cardiff
yeah cardiff played good football they had a couple of chances we came through in the end
if so the championship side cardiff city were first up to the royal box hit wembley there were one or two disappointed faces among the welsh they will feel that their team did pretty well and the next big roar you here will be when sol campbell will of course had f. a. cup winning experience with arsenal goes up to collect the trophy for portsmouth and what a moment for sol campbell particularly to receive it from a man who won it as a manager here exactly thirty years ago he was bobby robson then he is sir bobby robson now
we gave it everything we have got and that is all i asked for we have done everybody proud whether you are welsh english irish what we have done today is prove that maybe other teams can now achieve
better but i am very proud of my players the staff the chairman and especially these they have been snagged has done and i am sorry we could not be there for them they have been magnificent
it could be springboard for
matt civilly disappointed but massively disappointed but we gave everything we played well in patches but never got our luck
play it in the game it looked like he might get an equaliser
i felt we could push forward but it never fell for us disappointed but the boys have been magnificent it is difficult to take
i think it was a close game but we made a mistake at the back and they took it it is always going to be difficult to come back but i think we showed good character we did not lose four to zero or whatever we still had a few chances and they did not have a lot so it was quite an even game
and complaints over the disallowed goal
it was just one of those things when those things do not go for you you will always find it difficult l. do not know if it was a handball the referee said it was before we scored so it is the decision
by for cardiff city now a new stadium will it still
will you be part of it all
i will play here yes
niko kranjcar what a wonderful ear for you
be it is great l. have come here three times it is important to win the f. a. cup it is a dream come true
they caused you some trouble early on
they did but we expected that we knew we would have a fight today
had you really worked and concentrated on getting on crosses to test their goalkeeper
of course
power far can portsmouth going europe
a long way
tonight i have to be honest there
up now the one hundred twenty seventh f. a. cup final the second to play at the rebuilt wembley the game on the club that has not been there since nineteen thirty nine it is portsmouth's day here the final score one to zero to portsmouth there you have it portsmouth have won the f. a. cup and made harry's day kanu believe it good night

you've just seen the programme any thoughts
it seemed sir alan definitely wanted to fire me at the end and i was pretty shocked cos i thought helene was going to go so i was pretty shocked
we've gone back into our archive and looked at your audition tape you beat twenty thousand people to get to be one of the final candidates do you recall saying this
i can believe in anything i can gain information on a product and sell it like hot cakes no matter what the product is i can sell anything to anybody
so if those cakes had been hot
i would have been able to sell them yeah
let's look at where it went wrong
if i can interrupt without being rude do you like the taste of it obviously it's only available today
you have a tendency to transmit but not receive
i need to speak to the groom i wouldn't be able to just order it
is there something like where you can pay the deposit this is the company i like to order from because i like the taste and take the groom as to the final touches
the sales approach was wrong you're not selling double glazing
if i had been one of the recipients of your sales pitch if it's anything like what you are doing now i would have got hold of your head and pushed it in the bloody cake
you must have realised it was going to be tough in the boardroom he was threatening physical violence
i did at that point one thought i'd better shut up because i am going on a bit and i just need to relax and calm down
as a retail expert where do you think sara went wrong
it was the hard sell beyond it's your worst nightmare in any shop when somebody gets you by the throat and has you against a wall the desperation in your eyes i know but the truth was it was a desperate task the cakes were the same price as the frocks
yes i can't imagine anyone saying the cake cost the same as the dress
i think you were in a road to nowhere from day one on that baby
no i absolutely wouldn't i wouldn't buy anything from any of them the product choice was completely wrong at a wedding show first and foremost men don't go it's hard enough to get them to the shops a wedding show forget it and the one thing that women buy independently is the dress you don't collaborate at all we do have to have some pretence of collaboration on the rest
for the rest of your life really
to be honest no take or leave that you do have to pretend to collaborate on cake for example and i felt really sorry for that poor woman who was bullied into ringing her boyfriend and was then told it was completely dull and she was so crestfallen she'd just been told that everything she was going to do for her wedding was dull
to be fair that was michael who was doing that i have to say sara at the end of all this i want to give you the biggest hug because as the series has gone on i think you've been bullied by some of the other contestants iliiiiiiliiiiili the second i iiiliiiiiii iiiliii the second the second il iliiiii
they're not applauding the bullying by the way
we've seen your confidence ebb away week by week so much so that when alex said the person who sold the least should go you and michael had sold the least you immediately said that will be me then it wasn't you at all no i shouldn't have said that you got your energy back up yourself in the marrakesh task i really feel for you thank you
i was astonished cos you're clearly very bright you're beautiful
thank you and you're a barrister at the one point he could have fired
any one of those three and you just didn't defend yourself i didn't on that basis if i'd parked on a double yellow line you'd get me a life sentence
i think i did you know it was bordering suicide i was attacking my fellow contestants as opposed to defending myself i think i was just really stressed out i've learnt that you need to relax sometimes let go and think properly at the time when it was important i totally messed it up
jane just paid lavish tribute to you you're intelligent nice looking rather demure and softly spoken what on earth had they done to you at the beginning of this whole process i know your voice is so shrill you sound like a flipping maniac i know i do
high pitched i can't stand people who have attitude those that talk over me and those that don't listen to me
your throat must have been killing you
people were calling me saying sara you don't sound like that what have they done to your voice that's not me i don't know what happened i just sound drunk awful
there were two very different strategies for the teams we'll discuss them shortly let's remind ourselves of them
do you think it makes sense that when we split into teams one goes to the wedding dress shops and the other team does the other services you don't want to lose information across the dresses
this michael it's beyond me watching him
he is clever he did say central london is near north london it isn't inaccurate he is brilliant but when you're buying
the most important thing is that you look at the different collections so two separate teams doing that was just ridiculous from the start
that's where we went wrong one team should have looked at all the dresses so we could have made an informed decision and one for the other products that's where we went wrong jane
the killer line which made me know they were going the wrong way was this is a wedding dress so you'll look like jodie marsh on your wedding day i'd rather look like rodney marsh that would have made me run for the hills what were they thinking it was so niche that market
i know when i saw those dresses i thought oh my god how are we going to get rid of them they're awful what was helene thinking
let's go back to michael in terms of splitting the teams he said central london north london split it geographically but he was singing a different tune by the end
an intelligent person would have sent two people to look at dresses and two people to look at the other stuff cos then they could make an actual overall opinion
i asked michael why he didn't raise that at the beginning of the task
but he said the opposite from what i could see
yes for him it was a geographical thing not the logical way he's pretending it is there
he's said the opposite all the way through and he slime balls his way out of it beyond beyond there is a skill in that there's a job for him somewhere it just bores everyone
i like go on
he just bores everyone into submission because he talks slowly and monotonously the whole time
you said he slime balled his way out of it i like the use of the word slime ball as a verb i like that if the shoe fits it wear it in michael's case how did he get out of this one
over the next few months we'll be liaising with you about what you want for the floral arrangements the cake everything
the sales technique was pressurising because he was too pushy for me
these people are dum dums that's why they're dum dums they don't know what they're doing
i don't know how many more times i can listen to that nonsense
please i don't want to sound like i'm begging but if you can give me another opportunity to be a project manager show you what i can do i have more to give than just being a salesman i really do
get back to the house the pair of you that michael he was gone i don't know it's the first time in this boardroom that someone's changed my mind talk about a cat with nine lives
did he say a cat with nine lives here's a cat the question is if a cat looked like this and stepped in front of your car would you slow down or speed up that is the question he's very difficult to love isn't it
he is and especially so in this one because he was pushing himself forward and left himself open he should have gone he absolutely should have gone but i also think there was a reason for helene to go as well
on michael how did he escape nobody does that to sir alan nobody begs he defended himself which is what i was saying to sara
he was on a warning from last week and you only play that card once surely
but there is something about why would you keep this guy i have no idea he doesn't even sound intelligent
he's just useless and he's not that canny
i don't want to say here but
go on where else you gonna do it
i iiiii iiil i iiiii iiil i was just gonna say i don't know his way of thinking he's irritating and he just uses the boardroom as a drama he is into drama and he uses it as a stage and all this passion comes out and it's like where was that on the task
that's interesting but he is greasy
greasy may be the best word greasy as the butter used in those cakes
almost immediately i get that this is light which i love but it has a rich quality which is essential i can fake passion about everything whether it's a woman a piece of food whatever and pull it off with effortless charm i don't want to sound sycophantic but good for you to have the balls to come up with such an amazing innovative line i love it some of them were ghastly
why would one want to wear such a thing a garment hopefully that didn't come across
i would be proud to have them represent me especially michael
the thing is i am a complete arse licker
yeah you are
so i'll be good at that
basically if there was one word to describe you arse licker
he doesn't lack self awareness he is honest about himself
he does believe in his own publicity the thought of him faking passion for a woman is just too much because we've seen all the other bits and it's not good he's going to come a cropper that boy possibly next week
i think he calls out his own name during sex
il iliii iiilii'iiiii
back to you sara let's hear what the boss and your so called friends and colleagues have to say about you
she likes to moan and blame other people and always feels that she's being done down
to say that the person who didn't close the deal is responsible for the failure of the task i find highly unfair
sara is inexperienced she's come from a legal background and family businesses and it gives you a small picture of the world
you like the taste what's stopping you
the way she approached the sale was too hard nosed and forceful
she used the sledge hammer approach to sell cakes whereas she should have used a softly softly approach she doesn't stop moaning and complaining and she thinks everybody's against her i don't need that type of person in my organisation that's why i fired sara
what are your views
harsh that was pretty harsh i think the main issue was i was too defensive i need to learn from that i was just attack attack attack in the boardroom and sir alan picked up on that i think that's where his views came from
you attacked others instead of defending yourself
yes i did not say i've worked really hard this is what i'm about i did not do that that was my one opportunity and i messed that up i think that's where his views came from
so you need to be more positive
of course i need to be more positive and learn how to defend myself
the way you are here and the points you're making now if you had been like that there you'd still be in the competition
yes if it is about team playing your project manager helene
got off to a very unpromising start with this statement
in life i would just not associate with these people in business i would fire these people so i'm thrown into a situation where i have to put up with it and i've found it incredibly difficult
she doesn't like them personally and doesn't think they're good business wise where's she gonna go with that does that come across
helene doesn't have much business acumen in my opinion she didn't show it on this task she wasn't a good project manager she just floated around in a wedding dress and moan about everybody
she's a fine looking woman but there's an air of menace about her i wouldn't fight her
i found her to be quite scary to be honest i didn't want to confront her because you didn't know where it'd end up that scary eye look that she gives you sara i'm speaking she never liked you did she no and that clouded everything for her to manage you at this time in the series i think was a real shame
the other person helene didn't like was lucinda but she's gaining in strength at an alarming rate here she is taking on someone you'd never think lucinda could take on the fabulous lee mcqueen
the free range organic eggs means not caged absolutely
what's the lead time with this what do you think
some of these things may be easier when we're sitting down do you mind
fine we could get a whole consolidated listing
sometimes when i was speaking you were jumping off onto a different topic and i was going where's that from i disagree i take your point
you're the boss no no
i wouldn't undermine you and i'm sure you wouldn't me but we need to work together
he's magnificent isn't he he took the put down well he didn't spit the dummy didn't do a michael sophocles just took it
you saw that this was a good team and that this was a team that could win normally he would probably answer back he thought he'd listen to her because she's had a good few weeks
who would have thought he'd be this good at selling this stuff
he was fantastic at selling thongs
but if you put the whole parade of candidates in front of you and picked who would sell thongs he'd be last i'd pick a woman
he was brilliant at it especially doing the undersizing genius
let's stand back and admire lee mcqueen
hello ladies
lee wasn't initially comfortable selling thongs however he's being very smooth and seemed to be enjoying it in his own words he's loving it
who's the lucky lady getting married ah you've come to see the right man
he's a smooth operator
i have to ask you what size you are in thongs we're selling bikinis which is fine flip flops fine then we get to briefs and panties and it's um i have to ask people's sizes i'm guessing their size and i'm always guessing lower than i think what size eight go on then i'll have a twelve please you can see i'm buzzing i'm passionate about it let's sell some more knickers
he did a great job and judging by the look on her face i think he sold one to margaret
il iliii iiilii'iiiii
do you feel you're now the expert on that
on how to sell a lady a thong er yes
il iliii iiilii'iiiii iiiliii the second the second il ilii the second
i think we know what margaret's wearing then there's a thought so on lee mcqueen if you can focus your minds on that rather than margaret's underwear do you share my admiration for him
i do i think he's grown brilliantly in earlier shows he was a little aggressive and barrow boyish but he's used this wonderful charm i think he's got a great charm he's got great energy and has cleverly learnt to work with the team leader lucinda is a bit like that batty aunt running a charity stall and he kind of knows how to make her feel fabulous the two work so well together clever guy i think lee's in for the running i think
yes he's a definite dark horse i think he's brilliant and he has that barrow boy charm but he can take orders as we saw when lucinda he takes orders very well and he was also a really good team leader he's ticking all the boxes just now
last time you came on you were still at heat and said all the girls like the cut of alex's jib has lee taken over yet not quite yet
they certainly like lee my issue with him is whether his temper re emerges if it does he's got problems again
the incident to which you refer is when they all ganged up on you that night a couple of weeks ago
if you don't perform you're out simple as that if you don't step up to the mark you're going in the boardroom
a decision has been made sir alan has made it we do not need to fire questions at her as to why she did or didn't do anything it's my opinion whether i ask a question i don't think you should ask them
too many people stay quiet i can express my opinion how i like i don't need your permission
the word bullying has been used it's quite a serious accusation did you feel bullied i felt attacked when i went into the house
lee started it and he was not even on my team i kept thinking what are you guys doing i'm only answerable to sir alan where are these questions coming from there were so many of them thank god raef was there and lucinda was by my side people ask why i didn't defend myself and i thought they had no right to ask those questions so i didn't have to answer i didn't need to stoop to their level but it was horrible
you felt under attack rather than being bullied
i did feel under attack you mentioned raef we had some sound dietary advice from him
you have to remember that those people in a size sixteen thirty two dress and size sixteen and thirty two for a reason they love cake
he's just posh to his very core some people just dress posh some people have posh voices what's fascinating is that he runs posh he's in a terrible hurry to get into b. h. s. for some reason here look at the way he corners he's running like a posh boy
il iliii iiilii'iiiii
like a prefect chasing his fag there's a bit of rhett butler about him in that long coat bounding up those stairs not a hair out of place absolute poetry in motion i thought he did struggle with this task you'd think at a wedding fair he'd have had six potential brides and have sold a fortune at the end of the day but not in this case
ladies would you like to enter our raffle for some champagne
raef was not naturally at ease at the n. e. c. and at moments i thought he looked lost
ladies hi can i interest you in a dress
i don't know what the fuck he does what does he do pink panther theme tune
sales are sales obviously it makes a huge difference if you believe in a product i've taken a look at those panties and i believe in them
that's the scruffiest he's ever been dressed in his whole life
if there's anything that can guarantee you to cross the road it's somebody dressed in a fake fur costume
why would you see a great big fat bear and think of wedding lingerie the association is beyond isn't it it's ridiculous
i would like to see lee i'd would like to see raef but i don't think he's gonna make it cos i think he's a bit all gong and no dinner so i'd like to see lucinda and lee the posh totty and the barrow boy
how do you choose between those two it's like choosing between cheese and not cheese
precisely it'd be great barrow boy versus posh boy for me
lee versus raef it's the final everybody wants surely
yes i love the idea of any of those but i think it will be raef because he has been professional throughout and he has kept his counsel brilliantly sadly i think it will be claire with him i just think sir alan likes her he does somehow she gets away with it
there are some very high profile apprentice fans one is jonathan ross here's his view on the candidates
my favourite is raef who initially i thought was the biggest cock on the planet although i haven't completely changed my view i love the fact he's always dressed like he's in a catalogue but if you can't keep raef michael sophocles can go because he's a complete and utter twat
come on come on
he's an aggressive horrible little feller claire is awful why does she wear a scarf around her face like her head has been cut off and sewn back on i think there's a head transplant gone on there and what is wrong with lucinda she looks like a gonk why does she wear those hats i don't understand it doesn't make sense no one else dresses like that on the face of the earth
so was the right decision made this week then jane
no no i think michael should have gone
i think helene should have gone bad team organisation awful team organisation she chose the wrong dress and also she let her dislike of you just get in the way of things which is wrong mary oh michael
the slime ball should have been right out of the door gone he's just a plonker
so three out of three on your side sara let's ask the audience if you think sir alan was right to fire sara please hold up the red one if not hold up the other one that is pretty unanimous sara the audience loved you even if sir alan saw fit to fire you let's give her a round of applause you've lasted eight weeks i have plenty of highlights you might want to put your fingers in your ears for the shrill bits
one korma
so the ladies won good well done
i think i'm different and i'm not being naive i am the best you're a bad influence on me that's what it is we've won
with three lovely ladies
i mean it is breathtaking
we've been wondering what to give you as a souvenir of your time this gave us a clue
i've been on a cake course so i know a little bit about it the cake is a big part of the wedding theme and it's mostly women and you have to have cakes
right you've got to have cake we've got a specially made celebration cake look at the attention to detail that is sir alan himself and it says just fired if you're wondering how sir alan is standing up
the second the second il ilii the second iiiliiii iiiliiiiiiiiliiili
in rehearsal he kept falling over so if you're wondering how he's standing up it's cos he's got a lollipop stick up his arse i hope he doesn't mind

good morning it's sunday eighteenth may also on today's programme aid agencies warn that thousands of young children in burma could die of starvation unless food reaches them urgently despite the threat of aftershocks rescuers in china refuse to give up their search hope of fiemed finding many more survivors is fading
we are always asked not often but all the time when is indiana jones coming back this was really finally what we needed to do
we are looking at a task
case we get the word to go to think about how to abgplish our mission we would like to help no question about it
these pilots have been range of the burmese coast since last tuesday perhaps wopbldzering why the military junta has allowed a dozen transport planes to land in rangoon but not them for the men and women of this naval task force the maddening wait continues after seven hundred p. m. a m. we will see footage of how survivors are work filmed by an aid worker it should be simple to buy a train ticket in advance rail operators have scrapped their individual deals such as apex leisure advance and value advance in favour of one pre booked ticket it's called simple an advance ticket and will be available across the rail network there are changes to the way tickets are refunded there will be standardisation of terms of conditions and that is focused on the refunds policy train operators had charged a variety of fees from this weekend advance tickets will be non refundable and there will be a standard ten refund charge if you want to change the time of your ticket american senator edward kennedy is undergoing tests after he was rushed to hospital after having a seizure he is said to be laughing and joking with friends he is the last surviving four kennedy brothers president bush has been holding talks in egypt aimed at brokering an israeli palestinian peace deal he was greeted by barak the fans of portsmouth football club the long wait is over the team will bring home the f. a. cup for the second time today after winning the trophy seventy years ago a goal from striker kanu who took the side to victory over cardiff hope expectation and a place in modern f. a. cup history neither side had been here for some time their fans were determined to saviour every moment n. c. h. all we want is harry to win that cup make history and make us happy come on harry this is it eighty one years since we n. r. p. an f. a. cup tyndall we are back here i think we are going to do it the game wasn't a classic the premiership side never looked like losing but cardiff kept the pressure on portsmouth for the entire match with just one goal separating both teams the fch a cup returned to portsmouth for the first time in sixty nine years pompeii fans couldn't contain their joy
in the premiership and a f. a. cup final win what would pompeii fans have given for that at the beginning of the season next season they will play
team will take their silver prize on an open top bus tour the south coast team and their fans have tasted success they rather like it the search continues today for survivors of monday's earthquake in chiennafplt the rescue work has been hampered by series of aftershock the chinese government is praising the rescue workers our correspondent dan griffiths has more for us now we can speak to him in chengdu in south western china one of the worse affected reasons can you give us an idea of what the situation is there today
disease and also worries about these aftershocks how have those two things been affecting people
that is right absolutely of course especially the aftershocks and also bad weather in stom parts of the region here have been having an affect on the aid effort more and more aid is getting through although some remote areas are still not getting any where near enough the authorities now focusing not just on the immediate aid but also trying to rebuild roads restore communication systems and get power and water supplies back up and running they are trying to slowly help the millions of people who have been affected by this earthquake rebuild their lives
dan we will leave it there for now thank you for your time this morning fifteen thousand men and women have spent the night walking through london in their underwear yes they have been taking part in a charity marathon called moonwalk to raise funds for breast cancer charities the route saw bra clad entrants including a few may mouse faces doing a circuit which began in hyde park those are our main stories this morning gordon brown says some m. p.'s owe it to future generations to support changes to embryology laws writing in the observer newspaper he says stem cell research is crucial to tackling diseases like alzheimer's and parkinson's it's a free vote in the commons the prime minister at least admits he has made it clear what he thinks m. p.'s should do
he comes out strongly in favour of the medical advances there are so much controversy there are three many areas that have caused fuss the idea of creating hybrid embryos which involves combining human and animal tissue you use human d. n. a. inject it into an animal embryo to create hybrid embryo to cultivate stem cells a lot of people think that is going somewhere where scientists may not do it may enable them to tkwael parkinson's and alzheimer's and is worth doing and saviour sibling where by you create an embryonic cell and cultivate the deprels that to treat a sibling with a genetic disorderlet prime minister says it could save childrens lives and is worth doing the last area relating to i. v. f. treatment under the proposalsals in this bill you would no longer have to have a father as part of the parenting you could have adequate parenting in other words the prime minister said that would get rid of discrimination against lesbians and single paernt he is in favour of all those changes there is opposition to them
if he feels so strongly about this why is it a free vote what does that mean politically
are the polls showing for the different parties there
clutch of very grim polls in today's newspapers for gordon brown there is nothing good in them at all a couple of polls taking a national picture which suggests the tories have something like twenty point lead over labour the one he will look at is the one in the news of the world which looks at the crewe by election on thursday there it suggests as did last weekend's poll in the mail on sunday the tories are on course to win forty five per cent against thirty seven per cent for labour still within the margin for error just it seems as if the tories are on course to win there that would be a serious blow for the prime minister
flew above us we waved and cried for help but it seems they did not hear us
flew above us we waved and cried for help but it seems they did not hear us
along the delta hundreds of thousands are waiting isolated and desperate for help that they are simply not getting spain is suffering the worst draught in sixty years with some of the reservoirs less than half full many climate scientists believe that some countries will have to bus in water when shortages take hold an ordinary vessel with an incredibly precious cargo this was the moment that barcelona became the first major european city to have ship supply it with water usually it is oil or containers that arrive here but barcelona finds itself so short of water that this will be the first of nearly
two hundred deliveries all because of
drought that started in two thousand five
trained for the area environmental specialists and experts in forestry our resources are still limited but power is a huge state
deforestation has left its mark all over the amazon with cattle grazing where once trees stood
weak implementation of the environmental legislation the government has not been able to collect the fines issued against the illegal deforestation and the second problem is that people continue to occupy and grab the forests in those areas
down the trees we have to look after the environment because if we don't the animals will die too
morning to be a portsmouth fan
isn't it
there will be tens of thousands in fact lining the streets in portsmouth this afternoon as the players take to the city to celebrate the first f. a. cup victory since nineteen thirty nine the home coming parade will see the team in an open top bus so kerch catch a glimpse of the old trophy at last they had done it a first f. a. cup for harpy redknapp a first in sixty nine years for portsmouth a first ever place in europe naul all not a bad day's work
for everybody my family especially the fans the players it's great it has been a difficult year off the field to come here and win the f. a. cup is dream come true for me
portsmouth win was a story of one man's redefrpls when kanu missed that neither he nor his manager could quite believe it it might have come back to haunt portsmouth but just minutes later peter enckelman and kanu got his chance carp difficult caused problems they had the referee not spotted had a hand ball they could have been level that is what tinge is given for few could begrudge portsmouth their moment of glory
he za legend first cup in seventy nine years
after an f. a. cup full of shock and surprises the final followed the form book for portsmouth it was the perfect result portsmouth seem like wembley regulars compared to rochdale rochdale are going to wembley for the first niem their one hundred year history they beat darlington in in penalties bem muirhead is the toast of rochdale scoring the spot kick they have the chance toes cape the fourth tier of english football it will be a mass exodus from wembley stockport are also through to the play off final they beat wycombe one to zero thanks to that gom from liam dickinson it finished two to one oning al agree gait after chasing four trophies for a long time rangers are contemplating the prospect of ending the season with a cup double winning the s. p. l. out of their hands after they could only manage a at motherwell now celtic are in the driving seat they lead by three points with only one game for them to go crucially they have a far sue peepior goal difference rangers must play on monday at saint mirren christian dailly the unlikely hero for changers yesterday as they looked on their way to claiming the win that would have kept the destination of the tiet until their own hands but the chris porter equaliser after the break mean the advantage lies with their rivals across the city the weather prospects look better at lord's today after rain washed out most of the day's play in the first test between england and new zealand after three stop start days england look in a strong position in eighty nine without loss fifty three balls were bowled yesterday in ta time alastair cook made his half century that his seventeenth in a very impressive career so far for england england wanting to press home their advantage today if they can he will be hoping it won't be but it could be former england rugby union captain lawrence dallaglio's last match for wasp today they play bath this afternoon his eighteen playing career has been spent at one clob his club have had an incredible second half to the season they won ten out of their eleven premiership matches they are second spot and a possible shot at the bg twickenham decider in two week's time
for a club like wasps every season you there are to win trophies and compete at the end of the season regardless of when i was retiring this would be my ambition when you know that things are clearer i knew in my own mind i was going to retire at the end of the season can you plan for that and deal with the emotions bit by bit rather than them coming at once and suddenly i'm lucky to be in charge of that decision rather than that decision being made through injury or something else l. look forward to it
that struck me everyone has been talking about it with the f. a. cup final you get a sense of civic pride in portsmouth i imagine the same in cardiff it is a one team town or city that is why you feel everyone is involved and rooting for them they will have a big party today the redknapp story is people can buy into
observer is talking about story with releading with this morning gordon brown today mounting what is called a passionate and personal defence of the scientific research for animal human hybrid embryo which some people have a problem with with he back it is absolutely he is encouraging other m. p.'s to do the same plenty of photograph from the royal wedding yesterday afternoon across all the papers sunday telegraph thousands of british women it reports have had four or more aborpgss including dozens who have undergone six abortions by the age of thirty front page in the independent on sunday the colourful picture you can see portsmouth fan clearly jubilant after yesterday's win their lead story mrsa the cure the possibility there may a. b. cure within sight for mrsa break through they are saying by british researchers possible could save sixteen hundred lives a year if it's effective trying to look on the bright side of the credit crunch britain's shoppers will enjoy the best sales for a decade as stores battle one of the toughest periods in retail history sunday times also having the big picture spread there of the royal wedding yesterday story there m. i five linked to the max mosle ye sex scandal the formula one racing chief a suggestion there was a link with m. i five involved in that scandal he is not exactly led a quiet life surviving snakes and nazis nearly twenty years after his last adventures idgeidge is back idgeidge and the king doom of the crystal skull premiers tonight the film's oscar winning director spielberg has been speaking to our arts correspondent picking up where he left off nineteen years ago indie is back in the film itself there is an acknowledgment of how much time has passed
this ain't going to be easy
not as easy as it used to be
will be aimed at this time were not even born when the height of the first three films
we don't feel like there has been any kind of time passage because indiana jones has been as far away from audiences as basically the push of the button or the slipping of a cassette into a player it is an old fashioned movie because the first three films were old fashioned l. thought i was making a b. movie like old movies charlton heston used to be in seahawk those were theiconic old b. movies i loved growing up watching them on television i'm not that old old but not that old so i think that i needed to mod thel movie to become a kissing cousin with the first three l. didn't want this to be the borne ultimatum of the new generation of indiana jones that wasn't the point here
it will a. b. commercial success does it matter if it's a critical success
it matters to me that people get it enjoy it and give it birth you know touching any one of the other three movies in any order they want to place it first last middle it doesn't matter
i think the likelihood of peter phillips gaining the throne is remote so i think it was a lot for autumn kelly to give up her religion that is assuming that she did
so you're saying it was an act of selfishment
and an extraordinary act of self advancement on her part l. would have thought it was extremely unlikely that people put pressure on this girl to give up her religion in order to marry peter phillips it was a piece of upward mobility she had moved on from your background and therefore moved on from her religion in order to fit in with the family of the man she had married
although if he does want to stay in line to the throne it does say enshrined in the law that he cannot marry a catholic if he wants to remain in line to the throne and i think it shocked a lot of people that we still have a law like this
and this is interesting in the wake of what happened with tony blair who was an anglican right up to the moment he left office and then converted to catholicism
yes and it would have been extremely problematic if he had become a catholic while he was prime minister given what could be called opposition in the labour party but he wanted to fit into the family into which he had married and regarded it the faith of her family
and on the technical side she could have remained a catholic and the service could have gone ahead in the church where it
thank you very much we will be talking about it later as well but for now thank you very much so was autumn kelly plain sensible to share her husband's faith we'll be discussing it a bit more but do get in touch us it is the sort of thing that will get people talking now on breakfast bras bullocks and buttocks it's odd box hello and welcome to this week's odd box lots of funny stuff this week here we go the top ten you may have heard of photographer called spencer tunick he gets people to take their clothes off and he's been at it again
in many places in the united states if i entered a stadium with naked people i would be arrested so it's nice to come to europe and do my work and sort of get permission
it is big news over there
it's a big hole usually they're in florida so this is a first for us
i got my cutter and opened the door and cut through the seals and across the floor and across the
it's very comfortable
i will be perfectly honest with you i don't like flying all that turbulence and the small cans of fizzy drink and i'm sure i wouldn't enjoy this yes that is man with wings glue to him and a massive rocket at the back ivanov rossi likes nothing better than jumping off planes and getting up yves rossi up to speeds of one hundred eighty miles an hour now let's get away from the hectic and crazy world in which we live ladies and gentlemen the detroit symphony being conducted by a robot he's very good as well he's called asimo if anyone wants to book him the top three big bullock news time this is chilly he's huge six foot six inches tall that's almost as tall a peter crouch
chilly by name and chilly by nature but he does get on with the other cows
he eats normal food but for some reason he just didn't stop growing let's not be smutty for most women a bra is just a bra but that's before the solar energy bra came along you can charge your mobile phone or power up your m. p. three player but perhaps don't wear it if you're planning a romantic evening i'm waiting for nuclear powered pants when they come i'll let you know and this is number one and
hai kyung woon is four years old and he's a huge hit around the world he loves the beatles as you may guess from this a
hey jude
love mind you i'm not called it many times
it's like a habit in sheffield we call people duck and others call them love it's just natural
it seems fine to me l. don't mind them calling me darling and i call them darling
i think it's all right l. say it to everyone
the americans say hi money it's just figure of speech
i've never heard nobody be offended by it you know what i mean not like that
barack obama clearly needs to go and campaign in leeds because they're not bothered by it is it political correctness gone mad is it patronising and offensive we'd like to hear from you and later on we'll be talking to yasmin alibhai brown and melissa hubbard stay with us come morning welcome to breakfast with susanna reid and charlie stayt gordon brown comes out fighting on hybrid embryo research day ahead of a crucial vote by m. p.'s he says it has the potential to save and transform millions of lives good morning it is sunday eighteenth may also on today's programme aid agencies warn that thousands of young children in burma could die of starvation unless food reaches them urgently despite the threat of aftershock requeuesers in china refuse to give up their research hopes of finding more survivors is fading cut down on passenger confusion a simple amer rail ticket system begins today the f. a. cup is coming back to portsmouth after sixty nine long years the clearup is under way it was one hell of a party on south sea common harry and his players are attending here for a party in a few hour's time
we are always asked not often but all the time when's indiana jones coming back
i'm so happy i'm
good morning good morning you can see the stage is being set for the extravaganza this afternoon harpy redknapp his flaiers and the f. a. cup are coming back to portsmouth for the first time in sixty nine years you may have thought it was packed at wembley yesterday but here on south sea common there were around sixty thousand jubilant fans
it has been a great day a great experience never experienced anything like this you know good for us to win it unbelievable
best football team in the land
everyone is dead proud of portsmouth it's all there in the heart mate
it's here now it's over with we have done it that is everything now wrefplt all happy
brilliant unbelievable it will take a while to sink in
we pulled it off blue army
well after such a big party on south sea common you can see the litter left they have one incredible job to lect collect it up before everyone comes down for a party this afternoon the police say the celebrations were well behaved they made no more arrests than they normally do on saturday night as the bus leaves make it iss way through the streets of portsmouth with the p. a. cup to arrive here they are estimating two hundred thousand people will make the journey especially to see the f. a. cup come back to portsmouth thank you fifteen thousand men and women have spent the night walking through london in their underwear they have been taking part in a charity marathon called moonwalk to raise funds for breast cancer charities the two sixty two route saw bra clad entrance doing a circuit starting from hyde park well done to them more than two weeks since cyclone nargis hit burma with only a trickle of aid the suffering of survivors gets worse the plight of those in the town of laputta in the irrawaddy delta is desperate in a moment we will talk to an aid worker who has returned his exclusive footage shows how grim conditions there are people need food and medicine rain suppose poses new treats such as pneumonia these are some of the pictures taken by jonathan pearce who has been working with merlin in laputta
were there
well you showed some of the video there the situation for survivors in the heart of the i clone zone is really really desperate people are onto move they are looking for shelt uer they are looking see people with injuries that have become infected they need urgent medical treatment
the footage you shot yourself what is happening here snfrpblt these are people sheltering a lot of people have moved from low lying islands into the town of laputta
there is a lot of temples in the towns there these are people sheltering in the temple compound these people haven't yet been given tents there are tented settlements there they are sheltering under plastic sheeting there were about twelve deep in some of these area there is the hard thing for people is the monsoon rains which have hit hard in the past week l. was there it was raining for forty eight hours in those conditions health conditions such as pneumonia because of the sheer amount of water everywhere acute diarrhoea are posing real risks to people
what facilities do they have if all they are doing is sheltering under canvass
in the towns people are getting food rice is being distributed people are being moved from where they are sheltering on pavements or buildings that have been abandoned they are being moved into more established camps some are being moved out out of the cyclone
and out of the zone sorting out supplies in the u. k. and in other places in europe the experts that we need in country are moving in and out and around all the time so who knows where one's movements will be in the next few days
there will be three types of tickets advanced offpeak and peak times but the real cost of air fares has risen in the past ten years and we're trying to tackle climate change and reduce carbon emissions we need cheaper rail fares so it is good that the tickets are sixler but they need to come down in price
their investment in the railways so it means fares are getting more expensive and they will still so whilst the costs of going by plane and driving are going down the cost of going by train is going up and that's a problem we need to tackle we need to tackle these issues and the government needs to make travelling by train the easy choice for people
i would question when you say that car travel is cheaper it seems to be getting more expensive but it is about this issue of train companies not offering you the cheapest ticket sometimes two singles are cheaper than a return and if you don't know your own way around it you end up paying more than you need to
the terms and conditions around that but it is not a big issue essentially this is a cosmetic change it will make passengers it will give passengers less choices four they book their tickets but it is not really changing the cost it is not really making any fundamental change and that's
good morning
i've never been called sweety i must admit but please feel free
the issue and that's perfectly reasonable these are very personal decisions in a way
they are he was in favour before but i'm sure his commitment must be redoubled because of his own position you wouldn't be human if that wasn't the case and it is obviously going to be clearly controversial a lot of catholic m. p.'s are saying they are against it in principle including some members of his cabinet the transport secretary ruth kelly and des browne l. think most people will back it but you could all have a case to argue parents with alzheimer's or children with conditions and you could either move forward or stay where you are and most people are in favour of medical advances
but it's not a party issue
no it cuts across all the parties
which is why it is a free vote
i think it is around certain pits of it l. think the whips will come in on certain parts of it but labour m. p.'s are allowed to have their conscious for a day
would be that catalyst basically the opposition is desperate at coming up against gordon brown and they don't have a choiv they don't have a champion to parade at champion they don't have a champion to parade at gordon brown but it is bad news over the tax cuts but it takes five while to turn around people's perceptions of a government it very rarely happens
extraordinary indeed this is the latest development in the max mosley story when the formula one boss was caught in dungeon with five girls the sunday times reveals that one of the prostitutes was the wife of an m. i five officer who has subsequently been forced to leave the organisation
and that
and mosley has insinuated if not said directly that he thought he had been set up and he thought
there was an implisks of
girls or the security services the security services say it's nothing to do with them although there was this call girl who is married to a security officer
and it's very awkward for formula one he's been hidden away and there are
shall we finish with pictures of the royal wedding we wondered if there would be pictures of the wedding today because of the deal with hello magazine
yes the queen has been sold to hello magazine for half a million this is the wedding of princess ann's son to autumn kelly his bride there are so many pictures in the papers and the mail on sunday has this two page spread and you can see the queen there just behind them but hello magazine were given access to other areas including the reception so they'll get the lead on it but the express hit it as the tackiest wedding ever but they are owned by o. k. magazine which didn't get the pictures
birth you know touching any one of the other three movies in any
striking the prime minister obviously feels passionately these sort of medical advances are necessary not just because of scientific advance because he believes it could change people's lives if you have the stem cell research you could find solutions to parkinson's alzheimer's maybe even cancer interestingly too in terms of so called saviour sibling embryos a genetic match to child with genetic disorder that medical work could save children's lives too he is personally putting his weight behind the changes the medical scientists want to introduce it is a free vote whatever he he says it is his personal opinion he cannot say to labour party m. p.'s you must vote that way it is up to individual m. p.'s to decide based on their own conscience how they want to vote so although he speaks as the prime minister as labour leader actually on this issue m. p.'s can vote any way they want
the polls in today's newspapers are union formally bleak frank will you frankly for the prime minister nothing good in them at all the national polls they suggest that david cameron has something like twenty point lead now over gordon brown which is comparable to what tony blair had before he came into government l. suppose what will worry labour strategist despite a week of fight backs we have had from gordon brown with setting out his legislative agenda the ten p. tax u. turn that appears not have to any difference david cameron's lead has increased when you look at the crew and nantwich by election it looks like a tory victory this is a saturday thab labour since nineteen seventy four michael foot in labour's darkest hour managed to keep crewe and nantwich it seems if the tories will win if they do expect to see leadership crumblings about gordon brown's leadership position

it was a story of one man's redepgs when kanu miss thads neither he nor his manager could believe it it might have come back to haunt portsmouth but minutes later peter enckelman fumbled and kanu got his chance pt the relief was plain to see to their credit cardiff caused problems they had the referee not spotted a hand ball they could have been level few could begrudge redknapp or portsmouth their moment of glory
harry is legend now isn't he
the final followed the form book for portsmouth it was the perfect result portsmouth must seem like wembley regular lars compared to rochdale they are going to wembley they beat darlington in penalties bem muirhead is the toast of the town scoring the decriesive spot kick they have the chance to escape the fourth tier of english football it will be a mass exodus to wembley from that part of the country stockport are through to the play off final mitt they beat wycombe thanks to this goal from liam dickonson after chasing four trophies for a long time rangers are contemplating the prospect of ending the season with a cup double winning the s. p. l. is out of their hands after they managed a draw at motherwell it is a turn around from a few weaks ago when all seemed lost for celtic it is they who are in the driving seat they lead by three points with only one game for them to go crucially they have a far superior goal difference even though range verse a game in hand which they will play again at saint mirren the final round of fixtures takes place this coming thursday christian dailly was the unlikely goal difference a chris porter equaliser after the break means the advantage now lies with their rivals across glasgow the weather prospects look better at lord's today after rain washed out most of the day's play yesterday inlet first test between england and new zealand after three stop start days england looked to be in a strong position at eighty nine without loss that in reply to new zealand two hundred seventy seven five hundred thirty four balls were bowled yesterday in that time alastair cook made his half century that his seventeenth for england he will be hoping it won't be but it could be former england rugby union captain lawrence dallaglio's last game for wasps today they play bath today his career has been spent at one club he is stot retire at the end of the season the his club have had an incredible second half to the season where they have won ten ut of their last eleven premiership matches after propg up the table for a twenty four hour period that eskwens has swept them to second spot a possible shot at the twickenham title decider in two week's time if they win today
for a club like wasps every season you are there to try to win trophies regardless of whether i was retiring this year next year or the year after this would be my ambition when you know things are clearer l. l. knew in my own mind i was going to retire at the end of the season can you plan for that and deal with the emotions bit by bit
thank you very much he is not led a quiet life surviving snakes and the nazis nearly twenty years after his last adventure indiana jones idge is back it premiers at the khan cannes cannes tonight picking up where he left off nineteen years ago indiana jones is back in the fill testimonyself there is an acknowledgment of how much time has past
to be fair every movie i made is
tell me about the audience a lot of the people who the film will be aimed at this time will not were not even born when the height of the first three films
we don't feel like there has been any kind of time passage because you know indiana jones has been far away from audiences as basically the push of a button or the slipping of cassette into player it is an old fashioned movie because the first three movies were old fashioned back in nineteen eighty when made them i thought i was making a b. movie that charlton heston used to be in the seahawk those were the iconic old b. movies that i loved growing up watching them on television i'm not that old i'm old but not that old l. l. think that i needed to mod thel movie to become a kissing cousin with the first three l. l. didn't want this to be the bjorn ultimatum of the new generation of indiana jones that wasn't the point here
it will be a commercial success does it matter
what do you think darling
oh yes nothing wrong at all

significant part of the cost of
new system so not having to buy it
with your machine can save you
packet windows is the market leader and has been installed on many machines but in recent years linux has been placed on them it is the basis for a vast array of other programmes like debbyian red hat and ubuntu ubuntu has collected a large following because of itsies of use the licence under which software is distributed does allow companies to make money out of it it is worth remembering that the programmers creating these alternative sources is directly compete being windows so it is often best to make the environment look familiar ubuntu seems to emulate the windows experience as closely as possible so if you are buying a new machine or upgrading an old one a linux based operating system is well worth considering especially if you are on a tight budget but it is a complex way to save money there is still plenty of free software to pick from right you've just bought a brand new computer and although you have just shelled out several weeks' worth of hard earned cash it is still not loaded with all the software you need so how do you get the basics on the cheap to browse the web you have lots of options although microsoft's internet explorer is free to download it is limited to windows users there are countless other browsers around the most popular is fife fox hotly followed by safari and opera and with hundreds of programmers working on each they are in a constant battle to be the most feature rich browser around firefox
web browsers have been one of the most interesting areas where free software has been able to innovate microsoft have been so dominant of the market there has not been room for commercial alternatives so it has been left to enthusiasts and the open source community to take areas where they think browsers could be improved and to put that into their own products if we're looking for things like tabbed browsing and pop up blocking and autocompleting of forms these are innovations we saw first of all in free software but then picked up specifically by microsoft and the wider community
more products that pretend to be free anti virus products or spyware detectors and what they are doing is they're either installing spyware themselves or just detecting it and then asking you to pay for something that will remove it that's seventycal and not very helpful if you're trying to run your machine for free
why do they dedicate their time to it and give it away think it's partly because they like the kudos and outclassing software that has been produced by massive companies like microsoft and they like the comments as well
companies who will try to gain details and try to upsell you and companies that put in spyware in the download and the best advice is if you're going to choose to download free software go to a reputable source go to one of the major magazines or take a recommendation from a friend and when you get there if there is a terms and conditions section have a quick read through it and make sure you are not ticking boxes that say the companies can sell on your details afterwards
we are always asked when is indian that jones coming back
that is right fresh pictures of this earthquake and its effects still emerging and this is the village of or what remains of it it is a sea of mud and the mud came down in a landslide covered m. u. p. of the village and the really worrying thing for rescue workers much no one knows how many people are buried beneath the mud but of course when they do finally get to the bottom and remove those body it will be yet another harrowing scene in the aftermath of the earthquake and i think we are likely to see more similar pictures like these emerge manager the days ahead as the full devastation of this earthquake now becomes clear
yes emerging we look at the pictures now it is worth emphasising all you can see is earth and i am assuming that the village is literally covered up and t. n. reason we haven't seen the images is because it is very hard to get there
ticket in advance from today rail op operators have scrapped all their individual deals in favour of one prebooked ticket called simply advance it will be available across the whole rail network
there will be some standardisation of terms and conditions and that has focused on the refunds policy
train operators had charged
a clot of clearing up it was a really a lot of clearing up it was a really big party there are loads of bottle rubbish to clear up sixty thousand people were here jumping and shouting and screaming for joy when that final whistle went they had waited sixty nine years to hear that pompey have won the f. a. cup as you can
the heart
it is here now it is over with we have done it so we are all happy
brilliant it is going to take a while to sing in it is awesome
we pulled it off and blue army
have spent the night walking through london in their underwear they have been taking part in a charity marathon called moonwalk to raise funds for breast cancer charities the two hundred sixty two mile route saw bra clad entrants do a circuit starting from hyde park that is a long way to walk and good for them those are the main stories it is thor than two weeks since cyclone nargis hit burma with only a trickle of aid the suffering of survives gets worse the plight of those in laputta is desperate we will be talking to an aid worker who has just returned from there people need food and of course medicine now though heavy monsoon rain poses new threats such as pneumonia those pictures were taken jonathan and he is here now the monsoon jonathan compounds the problem doesn't it
very clearly illustrated there is the rain that is just ongoing keeps raining and is making the
we have a big team working out there we had a programme in this region before the storm hit
sorry talk us through the images we can see here
these sic situations by far of the bull of course the aid even that delivered by international organisations is delivered in a hands on way but nationals of the country and what organisations like merlin and other members of the disaster emergency committee do is send the experts that are used to working in these situation and they help to identify the local staff and to train them to make
i nou know you are looking at the images from china a while ago this is a town that has disappeared you are saying that corresponds with some of the things you have seen this cyclone is a disaster of the highest magnitude and there are villages that this delta is a series of low lying islands that stretch for fifty miles along the coast and the wave went completely over the top of them so you are seeing settlements which were very poor
they were built of houses made poor of bamboo and straw matting and there is nothing left of them so you can't really see the debris or the destruction in some places because they are literally washed
the reason for this is because people's bills are going up and they're not budgeting to take that into account or are they borrowing too much money what do you think
there is not one main reason it's a nasty combination of factors one is certainly that energy costs are going up food bills are going up but the cost of credit itself has gone up as people have come off fixed rate mortgages suddenly their mortgages have shot up one nurse her mortgage was five hundred a month she was quite stretched but her fixed rate ended her monthly payments rose from five hundred to seven hundred eighty a month that has pushed her into debt now she can't meet her mortgage repayments and her flat is
that's exactly what advisors used to say they used to say to the lender our client can afford to pay thirty a month for example the adviser will say give us five hundred fifty that is not happening because the credit crunch means they are desperate to get money in because they're very short of liquidity they're saying no and they're not negotiating our debt advisors at the trancact member capitalise at to inbee hall in east london saying we are getting a brick wall and members are not
students to get into debt in the first place
that is another story
thank you very much jamie it's time to look at the sunday
also on the front of the sunday telegraph who are claiming it as an exclusive they have a picture of the royal wedding too they say thousands of british women have had four or more abortions
the sunday express this morning looking at the upside of the credit crunch britain's shoppers will enjoy the best sales for decade this summer
their heads around this story the images of the american ships off the coast they say the helicopters are half an hour away with aid it's so hard to get into the mindset of saying no to that
much in despair it's a hand written letter of how she feels lonely she's had no visitors while she has been in prison in wakefield she wants to get out
how did this letter come to light
she's written to her parents
her parents have
the mail on sunday cherie blair and john the worm what is this
she must have known there would be
can i quickly look at this story is this what we are all growing
it's young women mainly a young woman is showing a lot of cleavage in this picture have you got an allotment picture no
kevin thank you very much
coming up in the next half an hour on breakfast wedding bliss as autumn reigns was she right to give up her catholicism so her husband can remain in line to the throne good morning you are watching breakfast our main stories this morning the prime minister has said he will vote in favour of research using animal human high bred embryos in a crucial vote in the commons tomorrow writing in the observer he challenges critics who have labelled the research as frankenstein science and says the technology has the potential to to save and transform millions of lives our political correspondent is here he has let m. p.'s vote the way they feel they should vote on this but he has very clear and
thousands of fans will line the streets as pompey celebrate their first f. a. cup victory since nineteen thirty nine the home coming parade will see the team in an open top bus so everyone will be able to catch a glimpse of the famous trophy at last they have done it a first f. a. cup for harry redknapp a first in sixty nine years for portsmouth and a first ever place in europe all in all not a bad day's work
my family specially the fan the players it is great you know it has been a difficult year off the field so to come here now with win the f. a. cup
that is
he is a legend now first win
so after a f. a. cup full of shocks the final followed the form book it was hardly a classic match but for portsmouth it was the perfect result rochdale are going to wembley for the first time in their one hundred year history after they beat darlington in their league two play off semifinal ben muirhead is the toast of the town scoring a desee sieve spot kick they have the chance to escape the fourth tier of english football it will be a mass exodus to wembley from that part of the country because stockport are through to the play off final it finished two to one on aggregate after chasing four trophies for a long time rangers are contemplating the prospect of just a cup double winning the s. p. l. is out of their hand after they could only manage a draw yesterday it's a turn round from a few weeks ago celtic are in the driving seat because they lead by three points with only gun one game for them to go they have a superior goal difference even though rangers have a game in hand celtic have the better goal difference christian dailly was the unlikely hero of rangers yesterday as they looked on the on their way to claiming the win that would have kept the destination of the title in their hands but a chris porter equaliser after the break means the advantage lies with their rivals across the city the weather prospects look better for all of us today never mind at lords after rain washed out most of the play yesterday between england and new zealand after three stop start days england look to be in a strong position only fifty three balls were bowled yesterday in that time alastair cook made his half sent that was his seventeenth for england now he will be hoping it won't be but it could be former england rugby captain lawrence dallaglio's last game for wasps today they play bath in the play off semifinal his eighteen year playing been spent at one club and he is set to retire at the end of the season his club have had an incredible second half to the seven season they have won ten out of their last eleven matches that sequence has swept them to second and set up a possible shot at the title decider in two weeks time
for a club like wasps you are there to win trophies you are there to compete at the end of the season regardless whether i was retiring this year or next this would be my ambition i think when you know that things are clearer i knew in my mind i was going to retire at the end of the season you can plan for that and you can deal with the emotions bit by bit rather than them coming at once i am lucky to be in charge of that decision rather than that being made through injury or something else soy feel lucky in that way and i look forward to it
could have got would have been
that she decided on the basis of the very considered thought the church of england was the religion in which she lived but on the face of it given she was getting married to the good evening's queen's grandson it may have been socially motivated so part of her upward mobility was to take the religion in order to fit in with the grand famine to which he was getting married
if she wanted to remain roman catholic would he have had to renounced his place in the line up
yes as mr. arbiter said it would have to be kind hearts and coronets scenario ten other people bit the dust because there was a practical possibility so i think we are talking about and attempt at social confirmty but it would arise in the case if kate middleton were to marry the prail's son
not i would be conceiveable that peter philips could have done it the other way round and he could have said tell you what eleventh in line to the throne doesn't really mean anything i won't have that
they desueded which way it was going to go we had a similar scenario when princess michael of kent married prince michael he dropped out of line of succession because she was a catholic he had a quiet wedding in australia she had a blessing by cardinal hume nobody made a fuss they chose to go the other way he is plain mr. phillips she is mrs. phillips he is nowhere near the throne quite
a deal with a magazine
no it's an arrange between mr. and mrs. phillips as they are now there would be strict guidelines as to what hello could do and couldn't do when you read the story a week ago there was nothing revelatory in it at all it's how they met and how she found out he was a member of the royal family there are a few pictures it's a bit of sour grapes on the newspapers that they didn't get the contract half a million pound in your pocket at the start
dell me about the audience a lot of the people who the film is aimed at this time were not even born ostensibly in the
with the first three didn't want it to be the bourne ultimatum of the new generation of indiana jones
would you get cross if someone spoke to you like this
senator how will you affect the american auto worker
i've never heard nobody be offended by it do you know what i mean out like that
the moral of the story there is presumably barack obama needs to campaign in leeds no one will be offended there yasmin alibhai brown is a newspaper columnist and melissa hubbard is a
melissa you have experience of building sites
is it because of the way he used it
it seemed throwaway
as i say it's difficult because i have not seen that clip before from seeing that my experience is that i wouldn't be particularly offended by it l. understand what you are saying about the feminist side of things
of me thinks if it of had been a male journalist what would he have said
american america
it sound carry the same conotations
have you had someone say
so throwaway someone
it was on air on radio they were talking about something he said babes like you are always making a fuss i was offended by both what he was saying
it's interesting
i'm not babe

hey i know what else flies in the sky a rocket as i said we're going to make a rocket to make our rocket we're going to need some foil some scissors some sticky tape a kitchen roll tube two sweetie tubes some blue paper some little black sticky circles and some coloured tissue paper now the first thing we need to do is cover our tubes with foil start with the big tube first tear off some foil we don't need scissors for this and then then all you have to do is just fold down the edges there we go that's the first part of our rocket do the same with your small tubes little bit of foil and then just roll your tube up this rocket's got a little bit too much foil at the end there let's snip it off with our scissors then just push that into your tube there's two tubes last tube little bit more foil and then roll away there you go we'll cut those ends off again and push those in three tubes now what we need is sticky tape and start sticking right little bit at the top a little bit at the bottom right oh bit floppy let's do the other side shall we a little bit at the top and a little bit at the bottom there we go now that's beginning to look like a rocket i think we need to put a little top on there to do our top we're going to need our blue paper first of all fold it then fold it again and then one more fold and then what you need to do is cut off the end what you end up with is a nice little circle we need to put a little cut in here to the middle of our circle if i bend it in it makes a cone shape it's like a little hat now we need to tape that together and put it on the top of our rocket there we go that's a perfect fit it's like our rocket's got its own little blue hat right there we go now the thing that's missing now is little windows for some astronauts to look out into deepest space i'm going to use these little black spots for that put one there one here and one there i still think we're missing something on our rocket of course some flames shooting out of the bottom and for that i'm going to need our tissue paper i've got three different colours here red yellow and orange all you need to do with these is to rip them in half give them a little twist and then we can push them into the bottom of your rocket i'll use a little bit of tape on that just so it doesn't fall out while we're floating into deepest space another little twist on here and a bit of tape and there we go five four three two one rockets don't really fly indoors do they no they float into space amongst the stars and sometimes they land on the moon maybe we'll see some more things in outer space through the windows how many windows one two three round square or arched which one will it be it's the round window have you ever looked up at the moon and the stars and wondered what it would be like to fly up there amongst them many years ago some men did manage to go to the moon they built a very powerful rocket which blasted off from earth it took four days to get to the moon they then travelled down to the moon in a special moon landing vehicle their first steps on the moon were very exciting they found that they could bounce around very easily looks like fun but actually they were very very brave because there is no air to breathe on the moon they had to wear special spacesuits now when men and women go into space they travel around the earth and use a space shuttle that can land back on the earth and be used again these people are called astronauts when they are in space there is nothing to hold them down so they float about everyone who's gone into space has said that the most beautiful object in the sky is our home the earth
right i'll just put this oh
justin what are you doing

now it's off to the tower you'll be up against each other sabotage the game my friend but do not blow your cover i am waiting for you kiddies who will take the rap only one will escape and the rest you're trapped
you lot i knew it sneaking around my inhabitable well keep your voice box whisperers you'll scare them off i've been fishing here for hundreds of years eeee that's why my bum's so sore hang on hang on i've got a biggun whoa ho ho hey look at that i've been wondering where that was my foot's been dangerously undarned erh i suppose you've come to see the unfortunates a rancid bunch today from manchester so up they comes up to the tower hope they're scared of heights one of them might be sick that will improve the smell of the place so who's in my fresh batch of cagelings this week that one with his head on backwards is jack renee she's a champion bodybuilder there's timothy he was born a mangel isobel is allergic to chairs oaiss he lives in a house under the sea sam comes to school on a rollercoaster i suppose you're wondering why i'm here that's because it smells funny over there no those unfortunates don't know what's in store for them i only came to the tower for a night's kip hundreds of years ago but i've been trapped ever since the voice caught me she's a cruel mistress i've never seen her but you can always hear her talking in your noise hole she's promised to let me go but only if i help her trap as many unfortunates as possible in the tower this is my watch tank from here i gets to see everything that goes on in the tower six unfortunates starts here at the top and works their way downwards if they makes it out the bottom they're home in time for tea and a slice of maggoty cake but it's not that easy to escape each floor they have to complete a challenge together but one of them cannot be trusted the saboteur treachery the saboteur's job is to make sure they all fail the challenge the voice chooses a new saboteur on each floor
you are the saboteur
and she talks to them secretly using the whisper clip a cunning little device that goes right inside their noise hole which means that she can be murmuring helpful stinky little tips to them without the others hearing if the team succeeds the saboteur will be trapped on that floor if the team fail it could be any one of them in the end only one will escape the rest will be trapped
floor six black widow top of the tower and top of my list
black widow that spider's more scary than my old pantaloonies to show you how it's done here's wileysnake an unfortunate trapped one hundred years ago the unfortunates are surrounded by white spiders' eggs they must use the vacuumagators to suck up all the eggs but they have to be careful cos amongst the eggs are black widow spiders you don't want to be sucking none of them up if they do more spiders' eggs will be released they have ninety seconds to suck up all the eggs if there's even one left the unfortunates will fail remember not everyone will be trying to win on each floor there's always someone who can't be trusted so who is it this time don't look at me it's up to the voice it's time to pick the saboteur
jack do not react you are the saboteur and you are the only person who can hear my voice it is your job to ensure your team fail this challenge when no one is looking try to suck up a spider remember you must be sly don't let anyone spot what you were doing i will continue to guide you through your whisper clip
jack is the first saboteur this is the part one loves best i know who it is you know who it is but they don't know can jack make the others lose so he can win
looks like the challenge has been sabotaged but has the saboteur been seen
you must now vote for who you think the saboteur is jack
i think the saboteur was oaiss because when everyone was turned i looked and i saw him going over to where all the spiders were
renee i think the saboteur was jack because i saw a spider in his tube tim i think the saboteur was oaiss
because i saw him suck up a spider and there was a spider in his tube
isobel i think it was oaiss because i turned round
and there was lots of spiders in his tube
oaiss
i think it was jack because i saw a few spiders in his tube
sam i think it was jack because i saw him sucking up some spiders
and there was two spiders in his tube
the vote is a draw you voted for jack and oaiss
what to do get out the draw straws
trapped
jack why do you think the others voted for you
they didn't want to get out on the first go and they kept watch of everyone
poor unfortunate jack you're trapped
every floor will trap one more jack's trapped and there's no getting out but who'll be joining him
floor five feed me lies
feed me lies that's my favouritist game no i was lying no i wasn't lying again or was i this game is all about truths and lies on this floor is a magical garden in the centre are two plants phyllis who loves the truth and madge who loves lies unfortunates must choose a seed and put it under the magnifying glass phyllis will read out the statement written on it is it true or is it a lie the unfortunates must decide which plant to feed the unfortunates must feed three seeds to the correct plant to pass get it wrong three times and they've failed remember one of them cannot be trusted but who is it
isobel do not react you are the saboteur it is your job to ensure your team fails this challenge you can do this by convincing them to feed the seeds to the wrong plant head i will tell you whether what is written on each seed is true or a lie
if she remains undetected isobel will be safe but if not she'll be trapped
let the challenge begin now
hello there my dears do you see all the seeds over there pass one under my magnifying glass and i'll tell you what it says ah very good some insects have seven legs
it's a lie convince them it's true isobel
i think it's a lie
it's a lie definitely false
it's false don't worry isobel you've still got time
to sabotage this well done it was a lie
well done kiddiwinkies can we have another one please
you can get them on this one stay calm
elephants can jump up to one metre high
it's a lie so convince them it's true
it could be true i think it's definitely a lie
an elephant wouldn't have enough spring in its legs to get that high
it might be true though it might be
so we have a vote who thinks lie
i remember seeing a picture of oh isobel you've just made
yourself prime suspect by not voting with the others
oh well done kiddiwinkies you've got two right you only need one more
you'll have to work hard to pull this back but it's not over yet
you can't burp in space how terribly vulgar
it's true make them think it's a lie i think that's false i don't know
i don't know anything about space make up a reason why it's not true
no because people like gravity gravity
don't you need gravity it's got to be a lie though
isobel surely you can burp anywhere
you can burp anywhere
go isobel try true
that was your only chance you're doomed
how delicious i love the truth
you have passed therefore the saboteur is automatically locked in the room
oh
before i reveal the unlucky unfortunate who do you think the saboteur is tim
i think it was sam because she kept quiet when we chose one
isobel
i think it's samantha she wasn't really getting very involved in the questions and she was just going along with what we said
oaiss
i think the saboteur was isobel because i was a bit suspicious because she seemed like different answers to us like
sam i think the saboteur was isobel because some of the questions
she would have known because she is quite clever
renee i thought that the saboteur was
isobel as well because at times she wasn't really thinking properly
you voted for isobel the saboteur was in fact isobel isobel you failed to sabotage the challenge and you were detected therefore you will not be leaving this room trapped isobel why do you think the others voted for you
because i kept on disagreeing with the answers
poor unfortunate isobel you're trapped
oh isobel didn't do too well there did she i hope she likes her new home
floor four snake attack make sure the snake is nice and hungry
right you are ma'am snake attack a strange wall faces the unfortunates one of them must make it safely from one side to the other choosing which holes to put their hands in they must choose wisely because the wall is home to a hungry child eating python she'll be waiting in one of the holes for a little snack it's simple if they get bitten three times they've failed can they trust everyone on their team not likely who will it be that's up to the voice it's time to pick the saboteur
oaiss do not react you are the saboteur it is your job to ensure your team fail this challenge you can do this by steering your team towards the snake i will tell you where the snake is you must use your powers of persuasion to fail this task but be careful you don't want to be detected
underhand shenanigans oaiss is the next saboteur he's not to be trusted i know that and you know that but the rest of them don't
unfortunates this challenge is snake attack you must avoid the child eating python let the challenge begin now
which one shall we choose
oaiss the snake is in the top hole
if the snake's in a box we should have a vote wouldn't it be in the biggest one it's going to be a vote i think it's the top i think the top one
it's feeding time
urgh disgusting great start oaiss
the snake is now in the middle
maybe it won't be top again who thinks middle i think it's top
i think it's top top top
don't worry oaiss try to get them on the next one the snake is in the middle hole again
bottom i reckon but i'm not sure
stand firm oaiss don't be a pushover if you don't get them on the next one you are snake food it's in the bottom hole if it's going to be three
i think the next one's going to be three as well
i reckon middle no oaiss you want them to choose the bottom
you've told them the snake is there
try top you're going to have to try hard to pull this back the snake's already been in the top i think it's the
time's running out oaiss you must convince them
shall we try top again reason why oaiss
i think there's a pattern
who's bottom who's top i'm going to go for top
you're done for you have passed therefore the saboteur is automatically locked in the room but before i reveal the unlucky unfortunate who do you think the saboteur is oaiss who do you think the saboteur was and why
i think the saboteur was sam cos she was always giving a different pattern to what i was thinking
sam
i think the saboteur was renee because she wasn't really putting in any discussion in our decisions she was just like murmuring yes no to anything we said
renee
i think the saboteur is tim because i didn't hear him saying much
tim i think the saboteur was oaiss because he always
had different answers to everyone the vote is a draw
you have voted for renee tim oaiss and sam as you passed the saboteur is automatically locked in the room and i can now reveal the saboteur was oaiss oaiss you have failed miserably and will not be leaving the room the others are free to pass to the next floor
the saboteur's been trapped
oaiss how do you feel about being trapped
i feel really scared because there's a snake right behind me i think i might get bitten so i want to get out of here
poor unfortunate oaiss you're trapped
oaiss has gone now there are just three unfortunates left every floor we trap one more
floor three wicked wardrobes are you afraid of the dark
you wouldn't be very good at this next challenge would you to pass they must have all eight lights turned on at the end of ninety seconds once the lights are on they must hide in their wardrobes and wait sounds easy doesn't it except one of them will be working against the others when a light is turned off it will trigger the music a signal to the others that the saboteur has struck can they catch the saboteur in the act and will they have all the lights on at the end of ninety seconds you know the drill who will it be who will it be who will it be don't ask me it's up to the voice
tim do not react you are the saboteur it is your job to ensure your team fail this challenge help your team mates turn on the lights when the music stops get into a wardrobe but do not stay there use the silence to turn off one or more lights once you have turned a light off you will have three seconds until the gramophone starts playing so you'll have to be quick
if he remains undetected tim will be safe and just a floor from freedom but can he do it
unfortunates this challenge is wicked wardrobes to pass you must have all of the lights switched on at the end of ninety seconds let the challenge begin now tim first help the team turn off the lights into your wardrobe i will tell you when the coast is clear it's safe you only have three seconds to get back once you've turned a light off
de d. a. de ding dong a lang a lang a lang
that was good tim but think about how to frame the others the coast is clear sixty seconds good idea turn off a light further away
de d. a. de ding dong a lang a lang a lang
it's safe think that light's outside your wardrobe that's good frame sam
de d. a. de ding dong a lang a lang a lang
they're turning them off too quickly thirty seconds rethink your tactics it's clear no tim you're playing it way too safe the more lights you turn off the longer they take to turn them on time is running out tim a good saboteur takes risks it's clear ten seconds you have time for another one your freedom depends on it
de d. a. de ding dong a lang a lang a lang
you have passed therefore the saboteur is automatically locked in the room
being a saboteur is not as easy as it looks is it
before i reveal the unlucky unfortunate who do you think the saboteur is renee
i thought the saboteur was tim because when i was in the wardrobe i sort of heard the footsteps that sounded like his
tim who do you think
i thought it was sam because the lights were always on really near her door
sam i thought the saboteur was tim
because all the lights were kind of like near me and renee none of them were near his and they were an unreachable point from his door
you voted for tim the saboteur was in fact tim tim you failed miserably to sabotage the challenge and you were detected therefore you will not be leaving this room
crumble pods
tim why do you think you failed as the saboteur
i think i failed because all the lights were near sam and renee and i bet they thought i was trying to trick one of them
poor unfortunate tim you're trapped
another one down poor unfortunate tim it didn't work out for him it didn't work out for any of the saboteurs today
floor two one way out and there can only be one winner
it's the fight for freedom let's hope the unfortunates have been paying attention now they have to fight for their freedom by answering questions about their time in the tower they're both after the key of freedom it's simple win and you'll escape lose and you'll be trapped i'm so excited i could bungee a badger they quite like it
unfortunates this is your fight for freedom the unfortunate with the most correct answers will be the winner you have sixty seconds to prove yourself let the challenge begin now renee what were the names of the two plants in feed me lies
marge and
too slow marge and phyllis sam what colour were the spiders' eggs in black widow
white correct renee who was the saboteur in snake attack
oaiss correct

poor unfortunate sam you're trapped renee you have won your freedom take the key and leave the tower before i change my mind
so i have summoned sixteen of my finest warriors to a land far to the east where they must undergo many trials to find the magical waters that can break this spell but my old enemy has followed me here and he means to stop this quest at any cost the quest to discover the secret temple the eagles now have twenty two gems and still march with all four warriors the panthers survived their test of strength at the sacrifice of eight of their precious jewels they decided to bring back arton and now their tally stands at sixteen the tigers' progress continues to be slow with just two gems added they hold nine but they still have all four of their warriors the two remaining wolves however were nearly reduced to one as their leader desot was lost at the field of the dead bringing him back in the team leaves the wolves with just two jewels both lymel and desot have been rescued before so as they strive to increase their paltry number in the many challenges ahead they must tread very carefully
marca yesterday in the riddle trap you lost two jewels do you think you should have sent a more nimble warrior
no because you need someone who is long legged and really good at jumping and i have the longest legs
jenro do you think marca made the right decision by putting herself in the riddle trap
yes i do because in the leadership challenges she was the best at that type of game so we all voted for her in the end so yeah she was the best for it i think jenro should have gone
cos he's the tallest and he's more nimble
i thought marca did really well i wouldn't have been able to cope with that pressure and just to get two jewels was really good
the warriors will be tested now on their accuracy strength agility and leadership as they face the sixth of the fourteen tasks that await them under the burning sun of this mysterious land so let the day's challenges begin eagles it is a great asset for a warrior to be skilled with weapons and it is your accuracy with a bow that will be on trial today the jewels you seek will drop to the ground when you hit the target but each of you must aim true if you wish to gather all four gems remember when the drum sounds the relentless march of the spirit guards begins if they come within reach you must abandon your bows and flee immediately or suffer their wrath so make ready the drum will sound when the first arrow fires
i think it should be taylan then you them samra then me
wait kadya as you're last you really need to keep an eye on the spirit guards and you will sound the alarm
everyone take three arrows
shoot one at a time or it will waste time
yes take three arrows
taylan will be first for the eagles as yada samra and kardia look on the spirits that guard this place are alerted by one sound and one sound only the sound of the thrall bells but they will not be disturbed if the tigers move with care but if a warrior should once become entangled in these threads then they will awaken and whoever has shaken the bells will be punished for their carelessness
who should go through this bit first
souk cos i don't think any of us can get through that bit
but be careful there's almost invisible strings
but the jewels are on the strands right next to the bell so don't get them don't get them cos if you pick them up
can you tell me if i'm going to hit anything bend your head down your foot careful
you're fine so far
the tigers have commenced their task with sohar does she have the agility to lead the way
go on go on that's it
go on sohar
hadav you watch marca
which way now guys
when marca gets to that point there you start stop sohar wait till marca can help you
there are hidden strings right here
shall i go in there be careful sohar there's one right next to you
look out there's a hidden string be careful
warriors the chant you hear is as old as the mountains that look down on this parched place it is the sound of this mantra that keeps these tree spirits at bay to unhooke the jewels from their resting place three of you must lift these ropes but the moment you do the chanting will stop and the spirits will awaken from their trance your leader sonro will guide you in this task for it is his leadership that is being tested today if any of the ropes should touch the guards as they encircle the jewels the warrior responsible will be punished
what rope would you like to go on
i'll go with that one
i'll go with that one
i'll direct you with left and right when you're walking and tighter and slack are we all ready yeah
pick up now
the chanting has ceased the demons will wake the panthers are now in danger
oh you almost had it there so close
pull it two hands
leadership is the key here will sonlu's leadership shine through
get in the middle quick guys you need to get this come on slowly steady the ropes get it flat you want it hooked
warriors the might of these stones and the power of the sun combined in this task to produce the jewels you now seek but that is not enough the strength in your arms is also required to carry these broken columns to the highest point there to reassemble them as two proud towers once this task is complete the rays of the sun will bear down on these magical stones and the jewels you seek will appear on the barren rocks below remember if you fail to complete your towers before the second drum your quest may be ended here lymel and desot of the wolves have set a blistering pace that will be hard to maintain under this beating sun
come on yeada
good shot
next person go go go
taylan failed to score a hit but yeada has done so with her first arrow a leader indeed
samra concentrates hard will his arrows be true
take your time try and get this one don't worry oh so close karja your go we still have two bows don't we
ooh so close try it come on unlucky just take your time don't worry we've got lots of time guys yeah take your time unlucky
there's one right next to your left leg
sohar and marca are proceeding cautiously in the threads hadav now enters the task
there's a string by your wrist there's one behind you which is the easiest way that was way too close
oh that was way too close
i'm really close to a bell shall i go under this
jenro too has joined his fellow tigers
i'm going for that jewel all right
be really careful don't get a jewel you'll make it go we're stuck shall i go under the i'm going to get it no
marca is lost to the spirit guards her agility was in question
don't do it it's too dangerous it's not it is
desot and lymel's pace has slowed now as they feel the heat of the noon day sun the spirit guard watches and waits as the wolves labour lymel has proved strong indeed by completing her obelisk first
come on desot you're nearly there
the four teams will be anxious to reach the citadel satyarani for that is where the quest begins in earnest
they must be patient for the trials are not over any that desires to enter the secret temple must be tested and tested surely
they are all good warriors
that may be but i am not looking for good warriors i am looking for great ones warriors that have the courage not just to climb in high places or fire an arrow into the air but who can battle with illusions solve the unsolvable fight the fears that lurk within their hearts great warriors can do this and to find such a one all must be tested to the full are your warriors prepared for it they are satyarani i am certain we shall see
who wants to shoot let taylan try it
yeada is still alone in having hit a target accuracy is all
come on karja
just take your time
use all your time
oh well guys come on let's go another jewel yeada did it really well she got a target in the first trial but i was expecting more from taylan
i was really unlucky i was so close that's not good enough but i'm really glad the team won a jewel
i was really nervous and didn't think i'd get a target but i was the only one that got a jewel i was so happy jenro you're doing brilliantly your head is really close to the jewel
how will the tigers fair without leader marca in the thrall threads
careful that's good right come over here right now you and me really need to help jenro with his careful i think i can move my head under this well done
right where can i go
wait keep on going keep doing what you were doing just shuffle along here that must've been really hard for you to go last
i had to go last to see what you lot did
well done
tigers a difficult decision now lies before you your leader marca has been taken by the spirit guards but remember satyarani allows the use of eight of your precious jewels to buy her back you must choose to keep those jewels or be reunited with your leader
well we've got nine but if we buy her back we have only one left can we afford that but she's part of our team as well shall we roll the dice then
i'll do it
evens yeah marca's coming back
so be it then eight jewels are required
that's them all
it was really scary because i almost ruined the challenge and then i put my head up and hit a bell and i was out then i found my team had rolled the dice we did the same for hadav it rolled in my favour and i'm back arton get it down the middle
sonro aksu yonra and arton are no closer to their goal some leadership is required
arton pull
quicker arton move yourself quick
that's it yonra slack a bit slack a bit
oh come on i had that there
stop moving about slack a bit more pull in arton arton pull
aksu pull it in a bit
oh aksu oh nearly not got it yet remember
quick arton just run run a bit arton run and then go slo o. owly
aksu run a bit right now pull aksu
many of the panthers issue instructions perhaps sonro should take the lead
slowly yes halt pull it quickly
pull arton pull aksu let it release pull slack aksu slack aksu more slack aksu like this pull arton
go arton we don't have time quick slack
enchanted demons was really hard sonro panicked so yonra took control
i don't think sonro was able to handle that challenge he panicked and left it to me aksu and arton to do the challenge
i think the three of us holding the ropes did well but i don't think the leader did very well in directing us
i didn't do well i wasn't shouting loud enough and my team wasn't listening to me so i wasn't very good but then again the team did it in the end
yes that's it well done you're nearly there
desot still has not completed the obelisk will lymel's encouragement spur him on
bring it up and towards me well done last bit come on yes well done you did it oh yes
the challenge was really hard because we had to drag the pieces to the top of the slope i got there first because i'm quite fast and strong but lymel finished before me as she's got good brain power she helped me and we got through and that's how we'll do the rest
it was a hard challenge because i had to drag things up a hill and i'm not good at that i'm good at thinking so i had to help desot because he couldn't see the pattern i'm really glad that we both got our jewels
the eagles gained but one jewel this day but they still remain the most successful team with a total of twenty three the panthers gained four gems and now hold twenty to their name both teams still march with all four warriors the wolves also gained four gems bringing their total to nine but only two warriors march under their banner the tigers failed to gain any jewels in the thrall threads and lost leader marca bringing her back reduced their total to just one gem the team may be intact but their performance is poor
marca a moment's carelessness in the thrall threads task cost your team dearly do you think you let your team down no i don't
because we all have our ups and downs and i've got to work harder for the jewels next time
jenro your style of crossing was interesting but do you think it was effective considering you didn't bring any jewels in
it was as effective as my team mates' technique because it got me through but we weren't aiming for jewels that time so i think it worked fine
sohar i was relieved when i finished
but i was still concentrating on helping jenro and hadav because they were still halfway through the course
hadav considering you had lost your leader you were keen to gather jewels do you think this was wise
i was keen to gather the gems because i was confident that i would get them but sohar and jenro told me it was a risk trying to get them so i didn't attempt it
and because we've got all four of the tigers we can collect more jewels later in the challenges i don't think we'll struggle we're good friends and we all have different qualities
if this family can hide a mystery celebrity for two whole days without one of their parents finding out they can win lots of prizes but first they have to pass some messy challenges welcome to a mess fest of almighty proportions this is hider in the house hello it's time for us to challenge four cheeky kids to hide a celebrity in their house today we're in scotland
we're going to set loads of challenges so they can win prizes cos we're in bonny scotland i reckon we need some of these fantastic we'll blend in like the locals they're gonna love us in scotland
wow they're really talented amazing
they once lived upside down for thirteen whole days in fact they nearly turned into australians flaming gallah we'll grab some disguises while you check out this week's gang time to meet the kelley family let's start with william
hi i'm william i'm nine years old i like football and wrestling my name's louise i'm eleven years old i love ice lollies so much i could eat one in ten seconds
and this is her twin
hi i'm christina i'm eleven years old and i'm really bendy i hate beans and bananas eeew eeeew disgusting hi i'm siobhan i'm seven years old and i'm a little princess hi i'm wilma the mum of the family when i'm on the phone hi i'm dad and i love to cycle everywhere on my mean machine so who is the hit on this week eeny meeny miny mo
who's the hit on for this show
ah it's dad brilliant but what does he think is going on
dad thinks we're making big kidz where grown ups get to be kids
but that's just a fake show while he's learning to be a ballerina he thinks the kids are doing boring grown up stuff
to make it more believable we've roped in a big kidz presenter kate her job is to get dad to do ridiculous things and keep him busy
the rest of the family will try to hide a celebrity in the house for two whole days
we're worried that if dad sees us he'll know it's hider in the house and the game will be up so now we have to go undercover too this is gonna be really tough and what's worse dad knows the house like the back of his hand if we leave anything out of place he'll definitely notice
so can the kids outsmart dad and win loads of prizes
i feel like a showbiz luvvie dancer now you're a presenter
come on let's get moving mum is distracting dad downstairs and we've sent the kids upstairs so we can tell them what's going on
they better keep the noise down cos dad is just three thousand six hundred seventy nine metres below them i can't believe how close they are to dad this is crazy

being the nasty judge on strictly come dancing i just found it a little bit dreary i was a potato picker from thirteen to sixteen i absorbed the renewable energy of the ocean and channelled it into the pursuit of hiding
dad's favourite strictly come dancing judge is hiding in his house
kate's supposed to be here and once again she's late william you'll have to distract dad i'll get him to fix my bike brilliant idea off you go keep him away from the garden

get out of my dreams and into my life this looks amazing
what are you doing this my friend is called quality control quality control you're an idiot this is how you play
craig's feet are hot hot hot from all that dancing so he needs to cool them down the kids and mum need to collect water and fill up craig's bucket the kids have three minutes to fill the water up to the cold feet mark if they pass the challenge they'll be the envy of all their mates with these bags and t. shirts
the spy camera is spying on dad in case he comes back at any time are you ready to play yeah three two one louise is off to a slow start they're never gonna win the prizes
i can't believe that dad hasn't noticed all this noise in the garden nearly a minute gone and they haven't even reached hot feet

was a perfect match what an amazing story jamie is here now that was nearly five years ago you are coming up to
going back to that decision seeing what you are saying was it a
charlie had it is interesting a lot of people are thinking are they having a baby to save one what do you say to other parents
how far should we take this what you have done may say to others if they have done that they may want a boy they may want it to have blonde hair and blue
that is extreme
can we talk to you what do you think that jamie has done for you
he changed my life completely he is the best brother in the world
did you consider the impact we see the impact but later if the treatment had not worked on their relationship and the pressure on their relationship
sure we thought of that long and hard what if it did not work what would the consequences be but it did not get to that point
plus you get brothers and sisters that matches all the time if emily had been a match then there would have been linked forever i have never had a need to ask my sister if she is match for me but she could be
it is fascinating looking at the boys they get on very well they smile at each other they are fantastic and tomorrow m. p.'s are to vote on whether to relax the rules on save your siblings and gordon brown whose own son suffers from cystic fibrosis has come out in favour of genetic research what we want to hear from you what do you think are scientists vansing medical techniques to save lives or playing god here is how to contact us next the story of world champion sportsman with a successful business and a loving family but his perfect world collapsed and he fell into crime violence and drug addiction he felt he could not sink lower then his life changed this is his story
pretty good then it went wrong
had a drug addiction steroids cocaine it nearly ended my life without being mell dramatic it nearly killed me one thousand week was going up my nose on chancellor year i never hurt my kids nor my wife but she was frightened of the life i was living she could not take it anymore i lost everything and anyone that meant anything to me that was probably the biggest blow i have ever suffered and probably the darkest time of my life for the first time in my life i was completely alone my daughter i was her hero my son he did not even know he gone for week he did not ask where has dad gone i blew my family apart she pointed me in the direction of a guy he was drug councillor and a christian l. thought they were whimps dodgey men wearing dodgey sandals tam breen bashing not really my image it discuss the does not fit with me but this fella said something that stuck esaid you have to choose fellas it does not matter where you are in life you all have choices to make for four years i had lost the capacity to love and be loved by my own family my own children my own wife for the first time if felt as if it was given back to me felt a physical warmth came over me threw the knife away into the skip i sparbed up the gun threw the bits over away i sparbed up the gun i stopped the drugs that is when i became follower of jesus christ what many people would call a born again christian want to make statement so you know where i am coming from i truly believe there is god something happened to me you have a choice fellas think about your life if you choose wisely you could have a glorious life thank you for listening to me it has been pleasure i am nothing special i am an ordinary man but i do believe be in can be saved my daughter got married in two thousand two to be able to walk her down the aisle was one of the proudest moments of my life my son who is twenty seven to have him come up to me to give me kiss to say i love you dad is a wonderful wonderful freelying my two grand daughters just to hold them it is wonderful it took a long time with my wife she wanted to see the change in me we got remarried in nineteen ninety three to be able to hold my wife's hand and laugh together that warms my heart my failt has faith has given me that back
the death of sixteen year old jimmy mizen in london last week has had a huge impact jimmy was killed on a visit to bakery the attitude of his mother margaret towards the killer was remarkable
i feel for the parents of this boy i don't know why i can't get them out of my mind we what has happened to jimmy is the worst thing possible but we have such wonderful memories they have not wonderful memories for their son all they can think about is the evil he has done so my prayers with are with the family
what happened
he found a letter that i wrote to emma price he thinks i want to forgive her do do you i don't know l. want to be you free
of what
it is a play about forgiveness how
the people tackle it yes
were you able to do that
i heard about the forgiveness project because of tutu what are you going to do with two sides far apart
that decision whether or not you do choose to forgive somebody as well i know you have spoken with people who have chosen to do that it's a difficult decision
glad that we can meet are you nervous
what about
meeting me
danny was going to right university
good for him
is forgiveness a way forward does it help things
one thing we have looked at in the play it doesn't change the horror of what has happened or it doesn't change the past and it didn't take the grief away but it's about moving forward desmond tutu says without forgiveness there is not any future his point of view is that it creates a better future l. think so i just don't know if i could do it myself
because i was raised as my grandmother brought us up as baptist later on as i grew up i went into pentecostal it's been a part of my life
i always say moo to my children grief has many faces that was so much to deal with l. chose not to take on the extra baggage forgiveness carries baggage they said it's connected with anger with sentiment and this plot for revenge i thought that's too much to cope with l. couldn't carry the excess i chose to go down the path of forgiveness
anne you lost a child under those kind of tragic
do you feel anne in some ways does it tie you to him the fact you don't forgive how do you feel about that
i feel as though i just can't believe what he did and the pain it's caused i just don't feel able to forgive him
also in the play we saw a little bit extract of the play there the mother chooses to go and meet her child's killer the young girl we saw in that is that
gee would you like to meet the murderer
i said that from the offset i would like to but i suppose in my own time i pray that by the time i get round to doing it they would want to see me it's a two way thing l. would like to because these are children that i saw grow they grew alongside my kids i'd like to know what went wrong l. want to know why
speaking to you from different perspectives it's everybody's individual
is right and who is wrong
good morning
where do you want to start with china
it's very difficult to be alone l. go up to the top of the mountains to do martial arts on my own a chinaman will come from beneath a rock there are so many people there over one billion people anything that happens there if there is a road accident hundreds turn up any little thing it's always a lot of people to go there
i heard people from china talking about that community spirit that now exists because of this dreadful thing that has happened to them
it'ss if craniating the way people pull together feel rather guilty i live out in lincolnshire not so long ago we had an earthquake it was one hundred a m. in the morning i was awake i was so traumatised but
that is very very sad there is a whole political history behind this which we haven't explored i would say that people who are saying that burma is a horrible place they need to wait look at new orleans that is mainly a black community look how long it took to rescue them
let's look at the dall la llama all of the pictures of him with from naomi campbell to the pope he is
you know him
poets and musicians want their photograph taken with him everyone says he is the nicest person in the world
went into a jail and met people he
all right you tell me you are
find a headline saying today in bradford all of the kids are really nice
on that optimistic note we will leave it thank you very much the slave trade was an ugly part of this country's history but people are still being bought and sold in britain right now today has been declared not for sale sunday to try to combat people often women being trafficked for profit here's the story of one of its victims this is the story of aleysha a victim of human trafficking she is from riga the capital of latvia like many european cities a staging post for organised crime gangs who trade in people aleysha is a single mum with a three year old son seriously ill she has to pay for expense of medical treatment
my son can't breathe through the nose his health is not good he is often in hospitals
in desperation she agreed to travel to england to work leaving her child with her family it promised the money she needed but it came at a cost
destination for trafficking women
the information came from a member of the public who thought there may be foreign women held against their will at an address in tunbridge wells or epbl oriental females
at first house one girl is found she is clearly distressed
is there be in else here no
the premises have been used for prostitution specialist prostitution specialist councillors who have dealt with cases like this before will talk to the girl they have found
with us is reverend steve chalke who is chairman of the campaign group stop the traffic good morning first of all can i ask you is this really going on in
they can get out of it many of them are afraid to go to the police are they turning to the church how is it working
these girls are isolated that girl in tunbridge wells will not be left there for very long there will be two or three traffic women in that sort of brothel setting once you form a relationship with another girl you have strength you can escape the girls have been told brainwashed so they cannot escape so every few weeks they are moved on they would go from tunbridge wells to sheffield then moved on to aberdeen then moved down to truro you keep moving around if you are traffickers but you cannot afford for the girls to believe they can escape therefore it is to the church to reach out to them and anyone else it just turns out that the church are filled with activist people who do this stuff they are aware if you have to if you want to stop the traffic you have to spot the traffic
people will have seen that they will think what can they do how can they recognise things
learning difficulties especially with autistic spectrum disorder but with the help of the therapy these children are helping to communicate through music these are just some of the children in the school learning classical music for the past three years through the rhythms of the music the children are learning to communicate their feelings
if they smile if they show enjoyment and fun that is very powerful and very very moving
fun but even jonathan ansell can find the lyrics challenging pour on water fetch the engines fire fire
well done
it is obvious that the kids are having fun what else do they get out of it
they get a huge amount of focus it is hard for the autoautostatistic children to focus movements and in their brains for a long period of time but it was stpak to see them focused and excited about the concept fantastic to see them focused and excited about the concept for twenty minutes of the day they are in there having fun with music inspiring themselves it is not just through the music that is helping them it helps them with the focus throughout their lives in the school and in interaction
you sound as if you have a passion for it how
did you get involved i i did a concert in the hard rock cafe for nordoff robbins a load of friends come down sold a load of tickets and raised loads of money and got excited about the project from there l. have done a few more performances for them trying to raise their professional trying to raise the cash as much as possible unfortunately the schools don't get enough time with it they are getting a day and a half with the schools as you saw there in manchester it is evident through the teachers the pupils the fantastic work it is doing for them
enjoying that we have seen that the kids are appreciating your hard work too
thank you
i this it is fascinating that the title we use for the discussion saviour siblings has an echo of religious belief and faith in it it is clearly a profound matter with a lot of do i mentions jayson and michelle are loving thoughtful caring moral parents they are a lovely family we have seen that this morning l. have been watching them in the studio beforehand but there are big issues raised we are concerned that the debate in the house of commons tomorrow is not just bringing into law for the first time what the whittaker family did but it will take it a lot further
we have had gordon brown one of the newpapers saying that the treatments will save and transform millions of lives you would choose not to do that
that is an extreme piece of hyperbole that i fear that gordon brown will live to regret the problem with the bill is that the science of it is the science of several years ago there have been strike new developments since the bill was printed that will render the ethical discussions obsolete that is especially the hybrid embryos one but also with the saviour siblings discussion we are having saving millions of lives is a massive exaggeration
should the treatment be available
lots of e. mails anne anne a baby has rights too saviour siblings should be used when there is no other alternative
what would happen is that you look at the family the existing children and existing family members and look for a match the next level up is to look on the registers there are registers of people willing to donate it is when those approaches have failed that you even consider saviour siblings
you are concerned about the free for all what could happen next
we know you have different views this comes from norma from hertfordshire children could be conceived through love not need and what happens when there is no match is it a step too far what would have happened if there was no match
charlie's future and there was no match and we didn't do what we did we could have had children in the normal way you could never get a match maybe but charlie's life would have been ruled by invasive medical procedures charlie would
have survived only on blood and
drug called deftra which is connected up to a pump nobody knows what his life expectancy would have been it would have been very our normal was every day
having to go home and stick
needle in their son we have everybody aels's normal now
what about you
they wanted me to have a test at eighteen weeks if jamie is not a tissue match we would have still had jamie
led record label universal music home to massive acts from amy winehouse to eminem to this rock'n'roll heaven
we wanted gregorian singers to come forward we had fantastic response we had interest from more than one hundred different applicants all around the world
news of the search reached the monastery while their history is twelfth century the monks dream of signing to the record label was more new
e. mail friend he sent me a link to this story of tom
i was astonished and surprised l. didn't realise this would come a big thing famous i think they have artists and pop stars yeah we are not pop stars we are only monks
a with a record deal on the table the dogs sign lay with the abbot
recording because we are in the chapel of heiligenkreuz here theholy cross is adored by the faithful they are just starting the recording
the monks may sound note perfect can they satisfy the critical ear of producer anna barry
could i ask just two points to think about perhaps it wasn't unanimous the intoe nation i thought it sounded wrong but maybe my ears were tired
the monks are clearly not used to the pop idol treatment
i feel mean you know criticising
it but that's what i'm here for
want them to get the best out of
themselves are you ready i am
definitely have that covered
the recording session's a success for the monks their day is not quite over
i hope that the medium will be successful to bring the message of the church to make people part of the beautiful aspect of the church and the message of jesus christ
joining us is the star of that video it's father carl what interested me is the fact that last minute you got the audition tape through on youtube no one would have expected you being able do that at the monastery
yeah it was a miracle three months ago i didn't know what universal was now i'm sitting here promoting a c. d. that universal made with us it's like a miracle
did you know what youtube was
yes we are doing a lot with modern media it was this youtube video that the young brother made was such a big sensation and why universal chose us
strong but i hope i won't chase you away it's like that that is nothing that is me alone the gregorian chant is about harmony of the young voices of our monks that's what is so touching
years old my monastery that is our spirituality we gather for five times a day to worship god in this kind of spirituality it's a very proven kind of spirituality you are really always touched and warmed up in your heart it really calms you down it brings up harmony in your life
you have at a side of t. the calm bit of it what about this rig mar ol the media bit
being pop stars
thank you very much l. hope you will enjoy us next sunday from colin and myself it's bye bye
know that is like about a week old
jewel t. is in cornwall with a team jewelet is in cornwall with a team of volunteers dedicated to rescuing stranded turtles
he was found by a
red in algae quite
dehydrated and it is the
dehydrated and it is the culmination
huge amount of pressure because all the support i had to get me this far i don't want to let everyone down so wish me
ray i am yes and you
you must be ray i am yes and you are john
thank you how long have you
lived here forty eight
time on its past yes maybe
would like to show me around
i would be delighted burford like
it is actual y.
it it is huge it is actually enormous
about get the whole population burford into
the church why so big
it is a it is a tribute to the wealth of burford tribute to the wealth of burford merchants in the middle ages they merchants in the middle ages they kept add n. g. bits to it it was a small church around eleven zero it got bigger and more and more chap l. s. were add d. and then on top tiny norman tower was put this
enormous spire there a lot of pubs in
burford yes yes in the eighteenth
burford century
we had at one time as many as thirty five but of course thirty five pubs yes
perhaps people in eighteenth century were thirst er than
enter so this is the
they are now enter so this is the old bull how old
is it
it has been it has been on this site since one thousand six hundred ten it is a true coach n. g. in with an arch way on to the high street and a yard behind with stables so that the coach with four horse in front of it could drive in under the arch go out at the back into a through and out at the back into a side street without turning straight through yes
why yes burford need so many coaching inns
it is on important routes to every the midlands to the south east and west to london through to east and west to london through to glouchester on to
bristol i suppose they kept going
bristol for long
r. than in it many place because you didn't have a railway here did you
no reason
here did you no that's one reason for
burford being the way it is think in the nineteen after the railway miss d. it it became stricken but then smn invent motor car and the world came back
these days burford caters for tour tourists and later on i will be driving through the cotswolds a bit england with international a quarter of all kingdom are based in rural areas and that figure y. to in increase as more and more people leave the en oy country life combined with growing business opportunities but there are opportunities but there are concerns that this shift undermined by what is known as the undermined by what is known as the digital divide between urban areas and pockets of the countryside charlotte tells us more charlotte tells us more despite the economic doom and gloom the spirit of entrepreneur hip is struggling on here in the british countryside these days lots of businesses based in these small communities and perhaps not the businesses you would expect to find rural britain is increasingly attract n. g. people who want to the dream but rely on a business the dream but rely on a business using sophisticated computer to finance it you can see why who wouldn't want to work here i'm in cornwall and place like truro torj in devon and wales are all fore ast be business hot spots but and is a big but problems connecting to internet and with broadband speeds could put to that that matters rule rural matters rule rural businesses employ five five million people and turn over billion every year if those businesses can't connect rest of the country rest of the world then they able to compete won't be able to compete according to some our broadband connection here in britain worse than in some parts of the
in comparison to
of seven people will be work n. g. from home writers and story board artists but large y. over fifty be based here if the infrastructure was there
that would have a huge im
was there impact
on this area
of the u. k. is cov
there are rural pockets or covered there are rural pockets or not spots where broadband just if you are in a not spot and internet difficult if not im ossible that limits the type of business you can develop which is what is happening to one man i met in devon to one man i met in devon barry simmonds runs four businesses from his farm in east devon the animators at spider eye he to the country when internet were the same every wra however while many other are while many other parts of devon are able to connect to broadband he agree graphically too far from the campaigning to get it so he has to
rely on dial up we are more than five miles from the hon tone campaigning y. the problem that's essentially the problem let's connect up here this may take a while because it is
what a what a minute well if you
would like
minute cup
of tea i'm arrange it
is it
d. to the internet with dial up it is like telephone call only a lot slower telephone call only a lot slower so we got to the bbci player and what going to try to do down oad last week s. countryfile if download last week's countryfile if you can click on that then we'll see get there because barry broadband and dial up is so slow he can't watch the programme instantly his system is about ten times slower he has to down oad the file on to
his computer before he can watch it well i can put the ket le on
you if you like let's have a cup of tea a ha so here we are half an from when
started yes
we try let's click to play shall we try it has
taken us about forty minutes to get john almost worth the wait he isn't saying anything the reason for this frustration is that here are five five miles from the campaigning the near r. you get the service gets we are going to see a friend s. now who has a reason ble internet service service we're only going a few miles to the village of weston mile the near st campaigning which campaigning ex excampaigning ex hange
so you use your computer a lot yes yes
if you type in b. b. c. countryfile
i do up there on
and we'll see up there on the search and we'll see how long it
there you go
if you do a z. n. see
doesn't need to down oad the she can watch the video file in real time there we go
i don't want to hear
this so music to
that broadband is public service broadband should be a public service it is a public good the benefit of the whole u. k. for all the people country cousins any more we're not just bungling along in countryside we can make a major im impact for the business community and for the leisure ascot in this country are not being given the opportunities of
doing so b. t. b. t. are responsible for local exchanges but it would take mass ve investment from them to comprehensive y. cov the country with quality broadband access
the issue around all access on the availability of broadband in regions is one really need to tackle not just at b. t. but as an industry over the technical problems that exist where the length of lines that exist where the length of lines connecting various people mean thaukt get broadband physically thaukt get broadband physically there are also financial about how much it costs but more than anything the technical problems are the barrier
this is this is a nineteen
wow see wow i see you have a petrol can here from around about the same kind i wonder how much it would have cost to it in those days petrol in
the twenty
it in those days petrol in the twenties was about ten p. a gallon the equivalent today
two a litre a bit more in nineteen maybe litre maybe up to four shillings a gallon
what sort of vehicles have you got here at the
i'll take the can and let you start it up for me how does that
work we have a key for the ignition start it
need to use the handle at the front a good old
crank a good old handle hopefully it will start
and it one it is fun to and it feels like one it is fun to drive broughton on
the water is the qold's busiest village tourism is the main employer in the cotswolds and time for this particular trip er to get back on the road again this is like the motoring of my youth and even beyond that because you don't get this these days in modern cars the wind in your hair the smell of the countryside sometimes smells you prefer not be getting but you miss all that be getting but you miss all that when you are cocooned in a modern smart motor car plsh l. have now arrived in winch kom after all that driving i fancy nice cup of tea in here this isn't any old tea shop it has just been voted the best tea place in best tea place in the whole of the u. k. by the tea council and guess what the owners are japanese a lovely cup of tea thank you jury juryy how do you come running a tea shop in the cotswolds
yes yes actual y. we if plan anything l. it just happened a dream come true simply cotswolds is the best place in the world and my mother she loves ethel austin that's why she loves ethel austin that's why she found this place in jane austin s. world what's the attraction
of the
world cotswolds to

of course english tea drinking drinking english tea in england best
it is very good tea congratulations again this is your re ward
it is very very heavy
particular generator create well well in the house i think there were four bulbs that it was running so quite a large bit of equipment for four
bulbs image if we all
had to have bulbs
in our basement to do four forty five light bulbs how far a ead of the time was lord
armstrong quite a head
there was little water in the lakes the lights wept off in the house so he decided to build a gas engine to run the dynamos here the problem was gas in the local roth area so armstrong being armstrong built a gas works as well
rather large garden yes he loved gardening as did lady armstrong course and they not only plant d. a forest garden but also a form l. garden a rock garden a garden a kitchen garden he had the complete set really
has a cast iron roof and a timber base and it is noted for its rotating pots so the fruit tree gets equal light
was he innovative in everything he
did yes h. in every part electricity in his house his horticulture his engineering he was always at new ways of
doing things how how important was he during the
industrial revolution extreme y. extremely important he is up there with important he is up there with steven on and
brunel why do i not remember learning
about him i push d. himself forward like brunel he was a great self self publicist but i armstrong had that in his nature
this bridge in cragside s. garden the first anywhere in be made of a prototype of steel it at the moment is hoped it can be rein orced to make it once again a route ross the burn armstrong s. innovation
now we all know about boys and toys and it would seem lord armstrong was real bloke at heart and had to have all the gadgets and must haves in his home he had to have a passenger lift so called labour passenger lift so called labour saving devices were fitted throughout the house the kitchen had a motor sed cook n. g. spit an early form of telephone was installed and by the eighteen eighty was hot and cold running water and a so this is an in how long did it take to build
we don't actual y. know entirely unfortunately the know entirely unfortunately the original house we don't even know original house we don't even know the architect but after about one eighty six the architect but after about one eighty six we think of different addition to create you see now that's a long time to
builders in un elieve unbelievably long time every go has interesting it this room with all the paintings was he really into
when it was built was a glimpse into the future now important part of history and this amazing house the be lit by electricity in britain i'm sure will be illuminating visitors for many years to come enter be still to come on countryfile transforming dairy farm in somerset into a magnet for lovers lovers and adam goes for glory in one the u. k. s. tough st endurance rides be but first the cornish coastline has become well known for the strand become well known for the stranding of wales and dolphins and porpoise but this year there has been an alarm n. g. in the number alarming increase in the number of turtles being washed a hore july now reports of the seven species of marine turtle only one is a regular visitor to british waters every summer least backs migrate a ross the atlantic to gorge themselves on our atlantic to gorge themselves on our abundant jellyfish the other six species prefer much warm r. waters and are not usually seen around the british coastline occasionally one stranded but this year does get stranded but this year there is real concerns as unusually high numbers of them are getting high numbers of them are getting washed up on british beaches threat ned by pollution fish activities and a loss of breed sites all seven types of marine turtle are endangered and protect d. by law conservation sts are now urging the public to keep a watch ul eye on our report any sight n. g.s of beaches and report any sightings of stranded animals so how do they they end up here what is bringing them on to our beaches
it is a bit of a
mystery beaches but
we think mixture of first of all southwesterly winds quite strong winds the turtles most have been quite young or had damage to their flippers which means they are in the which means they are not going to be strong swimmers and so are suss strong swimmers and so are suss sweptable swept susceptible to being carried by the
currents what sort
n. g. about mainly question talking about mainly leatherhead turtles
we had about thirty turtles the have been logger head turtles as well
are we supposed to have logger head
turtles in our water they are a sub
turtles in our water they are a subtropical species so they
shouldn't be up in these cold waters waters some people are asking is it climate change are they shift their rapings further north think early to say if think it is too early to say if there's anything more deep r. behind it at
once a has been report of the first to the scene is dave jarvis a volunteer for the a dedicated emergency service for marine life which finds itself in trouble which finds itself in trouble dave what should people do if they find a turtle on the
basically just leave it alone to start with it might look like dead but don't assume necessarily the case we have had several instance where animals have the beach and they become a bit comatose base their body are closing down to conserve energy so we may find an animal on the beach which looks dead but the thing to do is get in touch with ourselves we'll get the beach pick the animal up and get it straight into a veterinary it straight into a veterinary surgery who will find if it is ive
or not what is the success rate
turtles are now being cared for at new key s. aquarium and i have come to see how they are doing in to see how they are doing in their temporarily temporary home so who is this matt and what's his story this is
dink he is a
well what is going
to happen to well both
of them
now well our vet
both of them now well our vet is closely monitoring these
and he very happy with their improvement once he gives them the all lear they will be re eased back into the sea suitable off new key so we are off new naouk so is a turtle hospital on grand canaria the there them another look over n. d. give to re release them we are hope ul they going to do well
my great into this valley one grandfather moved into this valley one hundred fifty years ago son william george came over to a few years later it seems about twenty when he came to worthy farm so have been here a long time milk cowes seems like forever it has been a me for my whole life actual y. ever since i came back before the navy l. came back when when my father died and i have been here ever since the farm itself is a real for me the festival is just pure
fun really the first festival was
fun really held in
such a large crowd an im impact on the farmland impact on the farmland
festival means a litter gets left behind tept begs the field are carefully swept over by large metal detectors five or six times a year what
have underneath here a big line magnets as it drives along the field about six inches off the top the soil it picks up any metal lying in it as it ross the middle lying in it as it goes across the metal is on the top ace and it simply off
that's important as some cow have died ingest n. g. the metal the farm produces over ten five hundred litres a day bringing in if an annual income of
one million because we have the
one million because we have the diversified income
from the on the farm it affords the farm to allow all the hedges to grow out to grow bigger we don't have to farm every metre of every field to get the maximum out of it and so as you can see we is nice big thick wide hedges nice wide margins on hedges and that's fantastic for the whaould life and that really helps if the never been here has been going thirty eight years now the of these hedges would have been would have been grubd out turned into big a. r. ble feels and be corn would all be corn
the best environment to run it at all because of all the diesel and fumes and traffic and all the debris on the farm at the it but in spite of that i think do try and we used to try our best to re ycle the maximum amount of stuff and we clean the fields hands stuff and we clean the fields hands and
the farm and the farm and festival are in rinsically link d. and as mickel is the boss of both
always busy while we have been
always busy standing here
phone have to deal with when i go back but i en oy that you see l. find it stimulating other people climb mountains or go skiing and stuff i don't do skiing i don't climb mountains i don't go hike or anything so i have all these or anything so i have all these things built into my life so my things built into my life so my life is crisis driven really the festival dominates my life sbaoufrl affair with a farm the farm is like a miss farm the farm is like a mistress the festival is my work l. could be sitting in a deck chair in weymouth all day long now couldn't i at my age i'll be seven this year but i feel as young as ever was you know which is brilliant because i have which is brilliant because i have all this stimulation to the brain and to my body and i'm running here there everywhere and thinking about stuff as long as it works for me i'm going to carry
involve the main the main priority of the crew is to look after the horse the horse is the priority i'm concerned
you are going to have to skid around the course quite a bit how many place are you g. meet us
four or five place as many as us possible the idea is to get as water on the horse without hold
you up how confident are you that i are going to cope
we are going to do our best have real good time i think we're confident we are going to do right there what if
we need a
help people don't matter at all it is purely the horse
doesn't matter about my parts absolute y. no my
absolutely no my trainer nikki routledge is all here as she competing in
the one zero mile
ride i i know you won't be able to keep an eye on you are competing in the glor shoo one
i am i am yes i have an irish draft time horse to ride so both of us are concerned our horses are going to feel the heat the weather fore ast more of the same so we are going to have to ride carefully out there in order for the to over overheat i have been training hard overheat but it
that is the the horse which is a bit nerve the horses which is a bit nerve wracking because if it fails here it allowed to start the course course some horse have failed to get through
the horse because in the opinion of the because in the opinion of the veterinary surgeons the decision was that
luckily windsor luckily windsor is look fine form and passes the vetting with flying colours the vetting with flying colours he passed that's a relief
a bit nervous this morning even though he looked really well
it is a relief he his spots
that was
they
all gone fantastic fantastic tomorrow am i have to push him on a bit how fit is he
he fit but cobbs don't like hot fit but cobbs don't like hot weather very much so if you find
any water try to take him for a swim he will en oy that he is look
good to me he is fit enough he is fit enough he is on good form he is happy
dis ualified their speed will determine their speed will determine whether they bronze silver or gold medal my start time is eleven hundred i have been hanging around about quarter of an hour the butterflies are kicking in i feel like i'm under a lot pressure because of all the sport i had this far and i don't want to let everyone down so wish me luck
ten seconds seven off you go just just head towards that mark r. there's a drop to the gait there gate there
with the route opened up to us by local land own rs we got a real local land owners we got a real taste of how gorgeous the exmoor scenery could be and the horse seem to be en too an into the ride and on such a hot day it is a relief to cool down it is a relief to have a cool down this is hard going the horse seemsto be en oying it but i'm seems ating buckets and way
away the horse is look n. g. great
so away far
we are getting as much water on him as we can because hot
fully refreshed we picked up speed a across the moor test of endurance we stead ed up to conserve the horse s. energy we are well over halfway now my legs starting to ache but windsor is doing really well and the time goes in this case doing well aren't we
we are quite
doing well aren't we we are quite happily in silver speed very happy
well done we're
vetting six
that was a
to hear if if we could let him go we would let him go but he is stiff
it is all about the horse i realise that that's absolute y. terrible news windsor is just behind in one legs and the he can't run he can't go today it was such a big effort yesterday to get through and get past so that we could run today he had to trot up and be sound and he is not so we're out after all this we've for months building up for this event but it is all about the horse horse he has a lot of hard work to do and if he right he can't go that's the name of the game i'm gutted gutted oh lucy
it's so disappoint n. g. it all that work l. bet you got yourself all psyched up
i know poor old
chap l. l. just feel a
bit sorry for him how bad is he
he he omfortable he always had a bit of a there he tends to get it all the sweat and wet has inflamed it and made him a bit sore one of those
things unfortunately i suppose
things unfortunately i suppose it is all
horse isn't it he has to be sound you don't want to put him through five miles today if he is sore that
very nice
is sore you are secretly
quite relieved aren't you
i am a bit sore too
aren't you but i'm not the only disappoint d. competitor around fifty
per cent re ire or failed by the vets at some stage in the competition jackie i hear you just completed the whole one zero miles but you at the vet
you have come all the way from
america to take part yes and would do
it again but there was better luck for my train r. routledge who won a silver in the one congratulations one hundred miler congratulations so come on then the ultimate question how
pretty knack red pretty knackered actual y. elated she has done brilliant she has been really
happens it happens in endurance l. still am so im ressed with the you put in are we going to be able to temperament you back
you might be able
of the golden there was
still
certainly is
tell me about the man who
this house right
this house right he was called rebekah wade this house right he was called
he saw the house in country life when he was serving in the trenches as a royal engineer in
where did he get his
money from well his father had a well his father had a sugar plantation out in saint kitts west indies
what kind of a man he
i think he was a very clever man
he man
was he a keen gardener as stories well
he was very fond of cottage
well he was very fond of cottage garden
he didn't live in the man er itself but in the little cottage behind you
you so why did he
and
that's full of his collection and what
start well i started right here in mr. wade s. cottage this was his cottage he lived and used to sit over there in the chair
it is jam packed with things isn't it every nook and cranny how he left it
this is exact y. how he no electricity in here when he lived
here how r. have you
everything down that can see on the ceiling from the bells to the ploughs the whole lot
what are you photographing at this very moment then
at the moment have been looking at the table i'm actual y. photographing this quirk slash nut cracker here
he would have wouldn't he charles wade i should image of the things are enormous the of the things are enormous the samurai warriors and the nights in
armour they are going to be
this man who collected them owl i think he is very interesting and he does have an eye for detail he knew what he was collecting he definitely had a purpose he was going to do with it
when will be finished photographing this
collection hopefully
moment twenty one zero to go then
we are moment twenty one thousand to go then we are taking sweepstakes at the property as to the number of items at the end of it interesting to see
pay attention
we've met today with the line ministers who are dealing with the delivered to them a letter for their number one leader the senior leader than shwe from gordon brown insisting that this was a humanitarian enterprise and we put politics aside to help the victims of the cyclone and i think they are responding in kind and treating this on the terms we're offering it
off the coast american british and french navy ships are poised to deliver vast quantities of aid but burma's generals are still saying no instead the focus now is on getting neighbouring governments which get on a little better with the generals to take the lead and in the delta the supplies keep trickling through but it is much too little too slowly china says the number of people korched to have died in hampered pi heavy rain and aftershock the chinese president has expressed thanks for the international aid effort it has emerged the leading checktive of b. a. e. systems was detained when he arrived last week on a business trip mike turner and a senior clegg were held at houston airport they were later released of personal document have been examined american officials are investigating corruption allegation involving a huge arms deal gordon brown has said he'll back controversial research using human slash animal hybrids in parliament tomorrow in a newspaper interview the prime minister said he believed the development of this
research and therefore the potential treatments i think would be a travesty and we need to make it clear at all times that can can only be conducted if it is the only route that is available
what do we want for the people who want to do the job
what would you like instead
a new kitchen perhaps what about
there is a problem and it is complicated because we have difficult jobs and we've been secretive about our expenses we can address bits of it by being
that would be an incredible thing to do we're not trying to cheat the system
i would say you should be obliged to keep your old job going for two or three hours a week we have doctors and dentists who continue to practise on saturdays and know what they are talk being
how it impact on your life at a whole
we get hammered in the newspapers for what we're getting already and i saw your interview with kelvin mackenzie what do you think the front pages would look like if we gave ourselves the sort of pay rise you're describing he would whip our backside over it we have not reached a conclusion yet on this so i'm very very interested indeed that a panel drawn from a cross section of the public actually thinks that is the way to go it's a fascinating finding on your part
m. p.'s employing family that would be banned by our panel and staffing allowance is abolished
the taxpayer gets a thumping good value for them l. agree they ought to come from a competitive and interview process rather than just be given the job i agree with that but i think you'd find in most cases they would come through any interview with flying colours and everything should be receipted audited and on line
quarterly or other basis we should get down to a receipt level of what toilet rolls there are what colour i've put on my wall et cetera and that's the reason why m. p.'s have been defensive about this
and something new performance measures we would have to rate how well or how badly our m. p.'s are doing their jobs and they might even get a bonus
actually to have some regular feedback you're not doing enough of this and too much of that i think m. p.'s would find welcoming some of those things can be done systematically i can guarantee that the ideas you've come forward with will be fed into our review and looked at
have you set out
it was a pretty tall order to come up with these recommendations how do you think you did
bringing it down was reasonable and sensible the thing is if you go out and buy a note pad or a new set of pens is it worth the public expense of actually looking through all of those individual receipts
so that you keep all the information yourself
and there could be spot checks
what concerns me is why you see you feel you should be different o. the rest of us in terms of keet receipts l. have have had to produce receipts for everything i do in my work
some private companies have a level below which you are only buying something that is worth small amount you don't have to put in the receipt but there is there is question about the cost of going through all of these receipts which is a genuine question because in terms of the amount it costs to run the house of commons do you want an army of people going through receipts for something that cost three point five oh or rather pay the house of commons cleaners more or have better more people in the house of commons research department in the library so i think that it you know at the end of the day you have to get cut off point and the question is where there is a reasonable cut off point we do have to have public confidence on it that is important
the cost of that can't be measured we don't want cart blanch payment with little or new scrutiny
shouldn'tn't there be a ban on m. p.'s employing their own family
at the moment there isn't but what there is is a requirement now that you have to disclose it so it has to be made public there is a register m. p.'s have to say if they are employing a member of their family what happened lots of m. p.'s employ family members some of whom have are working at below the rate two hundred forty five they could get in the outside word and work incredibly hard there is a question about public trust and confidence because one particular m. p. derek conway was you know clearly abusing the system and giving money to his family when they weren't working hard for it and that was an abuse of public funds so i think we have got to a situation where it is transparent it has been put in the open but the question of whether or not there should be an outright ban is something that you know is subject to this review that is happening at the moment which is going a decision will be made by july on the one hand it seems a bit arbitrary to say you can't employ your relatives but on the other hand it doesn't people wouldn't think it was a fair recruitment process what about this idea of
are you in favour of
this business of second homes has been taken to the high court by the commons authorities by the speaker i know you wanted to say something
i want
have a constituency in scotland north wales you to have somewhere to live in london when you are working in westminster and voting in the house of commons and when the house is not sitting during the summer recess or something like that then everybody would know that if your address is printed they would know your flat was empty and there is a security issue that is one block for example where i think about seventeen m. p.'s all live in this block and it makes them a bit of a sitting target if it is all published and the other people are saying we don't want it published that we have seventeen mpings in our block
you have made your point
we lost in the court but that is our argument
and detailed one and have to look at it and take legal advice l. think it was worth that money to put forward the argument that there is a security issue here and what in what other walk of life police chiefs don't have their addresses where their are they are living in the papers l. know it looks as if we are trying to just be trying to take money and not be prepared to be open about it but it is not about the amounts it is the addresses that is the key thing
there are lots of resources so you
chance to put our house in order show its above board make sure that we have got the proper support services for m. p.'s but so they can do their job properly but make sure
favourable you were or against m. p.'s you were did you become more favourable the more you looked into it or more hostile the more you looked into it are we better than you thought we were
the way
taking the time out do this it has been an interesting process l. know you will stay with us for a bit longer but just to say if you have been inspired by watching jude and bob get stuck in perhaps you would like to take part in another politic show challenge in a few weeks the government will publish a review about how our personal data is used they all involve handing it over to someone the politics show is looking for a family who would like to see if they can avoid the gaze of the survauians society for a whole week if you are up for it you can see details on the website if you are suspicious of the web you can write to us be in no doubt what political story will dominate the headlines this week and next last time the conservatives gain add seat from labour at by election was back in nineteen seventy eight i was in short trousers almost the conservatives have been out in crewe and amp nantwich all week david cameron was there on thursday as you can see as was the liberal democrat leader nick clegg both sensing labour could be in trouble there and jack straw has been there too gordon brown doesn't do election campaigns but the politics show north west political editor has been camped out this week how is it looking up there
it promises to be fascinateling you will remember we spoke to the conservatives about their chances on the programme the liberal democrats are the traditional by election special lists and chris huhne is up there for them today thanks you very much for being with us there used to be a time when we would hear about labour liberal democrat band wagons rolling it seems to be as stationery as that train behind you
well if i had five for every time i heard the commentators say it wasn't rolling at by election it would be rich there h. are a lot of labour supporters who are now saying hang on we are not going to vote for the labour party this time because we know that they have let us down both locally and let us down for example on doubling the ten pence tax rate on some of the lowest paid but the conservatives didn't oppose that when it came up in particle so a lot of labour people will be thinking about voting liberal democrat in the run up to thursday and i believe there will be a very pleasant surprise for our candidate on thursday
because you dumped your orgeal one of he e. mailed us to say the selection process is a sham and i am seething with anger the from are the party that
thank you up in crewe and harriet harman is still us with we heard from our north west political editor about this of the campaign you have been rung and steve mccain has talked about the conservative candidate as being from an a very privileged background what is excessively privileged
his parents are he is barrister so your parents background count
you are the niece of the countess of longed for you went to the poshest girls school in the country which gets the best private school results does that make you excessively privileged
i have never made any issue about my background we think tamsin is the best candidate and you know we are putting the focus on her and how she would good person to be
this campaign
it is the not the main focus you have taken that
an excellent candidate and you know we think she would be the best person to be representative for crewe and amp nantwich and we are proud of what the labour government has done over the last eleven years and have got a good programme for the tue future
this is another leaflet that has been put out it says tory boy application form do you think a re think is adding another wing to your mansion we've seen where tamsin dunwoody lives and we think if looks like mansion as well is this not just going back to the class era
well under the tories there was mass unemployment and people at the bottom of society were suffering especially with the resessions and labour has cut unemployment and ensuring we have good public services and that is what we stand for and that is when we're illustrating
are you worried that the polls book bad for you
it's not good second guessing the decision to be made by the people of crewe and nantwich on thursday
tamsin dunwoody who you speak so highly of thee was asked on youtube three times do you think gordon brown is a good person for your campaign she can't seem to say a good word for gordon brown isn't that the problem you face in the country
not at all what tamsin dunwoody is saying is she is it is the one running for the by election in crews crewe and nantwich not gordon brown but i have absolute confidence in gordon brown who has steered the country through difficult circumstances in the past and is the right person for going forward when we have the credit crunch coming from america
and do you accept there are rumblings in the corridors of westminster over how fit and suitable he is to carry on
i'm not going to high poth thighs over what the results of thursday will be and whatever the results and i do hope we have tamsin because i think she will be by far the best representative for that area we're going to get on the job that our public services continue to improve and people can get on with our lives that's our responsibility
to influence the police
we have to take into account that the mayor is elected and voted for by over a million people and we are always going to be taking the view the democratic mandate that's what we did with the last mayor and we will with this one and we have a very good relationship
whether we're getting the results we need so it's not an issue over who is doing the job but whether it is being done properly
if you felt he had been doing a pretty good job would it not be fair to give him a second term
do you think he should get a second term
the point is this whoever runs the police it's a big steer on how the police is made and if he has not done a good job he should be removed and the impetus is now we need people with new ideas
have the people lost confidence in him
well i don't see people jumping up and down be
i don't believe he has been hounded out he's survived many a witch hunt l. don't believe he is being hounded out we don't know if it is true that he's going you say it is time for change and
you impetus where what is the new impetus he has not been delivering
but dawn we can talk about people's feeling of crime but how strong an indicator is that because the statistics show that crime is coming down and people say people don't feel that
we have to do two things here number one we have to be clear that the media is responsible in reporting climb because if the facts show that crime is coming down it is irresponsible when people say crime has tripled
have a shooting every seventeen days but that is no longer the case and if you walk along the streets in brent and talk to young people they'll tell you that they feel a little bit safer and the fear is coming down but if you're constantly bombarding them with headlines that say there is crime and don't come out of your door after six p. m. you're fuelling that crime and i think that is irresponsible
do you think these are meaningless gestures by boris johnson banning alcohol on public transport and putting more officers on the buses
i think it is key if we're talking three the fear of crime we have to send a message if you're a young person much of the crime instigated amongst young people is not recorded and that's why they have a fear of crime so we need to take charge and particularly with young people we need to interfere before they take up crime and that's why the action
unfortunately certainly of europe and it's not unfortunate that i see it like that it's about our young people many young people in our environment don't feel safe they don't think adults are defending them so they feel they have to defend themselves
were labour slow at tackling this
ken did a lot to tackle crime and i understand that the money he got from the home office that boris is not committed to spend on youth service which is a disgrace
we don't know if that is true yet but that came after we'd already lost thirty lives
it and a lot of the pre emption work needs to be done in a particular way you can't just concentrate on catching people because the amount of society that the amount of crime that society suffers from a lot of the people in detention are not afraid of the police and one place where the government has missed out on is in prison the way we do not educate them or give them rehabilitation or drug help is a massive opportunity missed in this country
the development of the park is the biggest regeneration project in western europe the agency has invested in buying the land so the mayor will be keen to see return on that investment one area where i is thought he may want to influence the legacy on the proportion of affordable homes to be left on the site
the fact for him the olympics was about j. e. generation but if from the new mayor is there is a different message there is more emphasis on sporting participation
kate hoey the m. p. is going to be the mayor's
the new mayor has promised he won't be pulling any punchs round the board table but what does he think about the prospect of working with labour's olympics minister who who was ken
boris johnson's newly appointed minister for sport is with us here you left your tennis racket at home before we get on the the olympic matter sir ian blair you think he should have a second term
i have only read what i have seen in the paper and len duvall had that discussion before the election l. think we will have to wait and see
lot of concern what happened then we have moved on and i feel he has another two year fos go any way and i imagine that is what they are talking about what is going to happen after that
what do you think
i am sure there will be think somebody new in twen his days are numbered you are saying that i am not some would say it is curious others say astonishing you have this post in relation to the london olympics baz you were never a fan of the londoned by you didn't think they were going to win i think paris has a wonderful sporting stprubg bg infrastructure i felt we hadn't done much on sport once we got the olympic my job and what i think londoners want to see is us delivering on
it is kind of fair weather do you remember it was a sensitive time for london two thousand twelve trying to get public support then we have a former sports minister saying i don't think london should get it
who feel hostile towards you because of it
i think the people i am interested in are mainly the people who are out there in the community delivering sport nay are the people that matter they are the people the grass roots sports people that i want to get on side i think the people who are running the olympics are doing probably a very very good job now we have to deliver and excellent games and the government is going to make sure that happens whatever it costs l. think it is important very soon we get to make sure any holes that are there any other bad news that will come out i think needs to come out as soon as possible
you saw the reports about we knew about the cost or certain people knew about the cost of the aquatic centre
different bits of london we are not following best practice we are not co ordinating some of the local authoritys are doing a good job we are not getting that co ordination so that everyone is singing from the same him sheet in o. hymn sheet there is a lot of money
in what circumstances
boris johnson when are you going to be prepared to tell if him if he doesn't get things right
my test is whether we have delivered on what we want do is whether this four years time apart from deliver ago wonderful olympic games apart from the legacy that that leaves in east london if every londoner out there in outer london boroughs in inner city areas like mine will be able to say they have seen something that has made a difference to their young people and their older people's opportunities to participate in sport why are we closing swimming pools in london we should not be allowing that to happen why are we allowing playing fields to be sold off i want to capture the imagination and the real support for sport that the olympics can bring and i think what we just seen is a bit of shift in the emphasis not any not anything reneging on anything that will happen on the olympics
a political traitor how badly is that going to damage you seeing you are labour
sport is one thing where people want the see people working together i have had people saying politicians talk about go getting on with each other and talking and they look on the public outside as if they are fighting each other and i think the public will recognise that this was an imaginative way of looking at how we run sport in london and while there will be some people who feel as a labour m. p. i shouldn't be working in a tory administration i am ringfenced dealing on sport and think the
public will like it thank you now old age ain't no place for sissys as bette davis once said everything gets harder as time catches us with us and our last few years are often the hardest are we guilty as a nation of discriminating against older people in a moment i will speak to baroness julia neuberger who has just written a new book called not dead yet inspired by some of the treatment her elderly relatives received at the end of their life this was the response in newcastle
i think a lot of elderly folk fi this they are entitled to more than they are l. think in this day and age and specially where i live elderly people are well cared for
i think it depend when you talk about we heard people saying it is not too bad but they are active lively and out there l. think it is the people who are really frail and who are in the hands of our health service or care homes or in our nursing homes and i think many of them do suffer some real discrimination and there is real discrimination in the amount of choice they are given about what happens to them
this is we asked people for their views and one viewer who is seventy john dickinson he said in general the idea the elderly are discriminal naith naited against is nonsense politician have bofrpbt backward to keep the grey lobby onboard here have a few free bus passes heating allowance isn't that an important point shouldn't help be given on the basis of need
i think help should be given much more on the basis of need but the real thing i feel is there is lots of things like free bus passes that everybody loves but probably a lot of people don't need but there is a loft things that go on that shouldn't happen for instance why should people have to retire at sixty five why did the government in a sense give in to the c. b. i. and say it is o. k. to force people out at of five surely you should be judge on whether you can do the job what about television presenters of you are only allowed to be a voice on radio when you are older what is that about
i i won't go into that one special pleading there we will leave that to one side for the moment but you can calling for a grey panther movement in this book
i am l. think older people and the
no l. think age concern and help the aged and the cher other charities do very good work but i don't think they have been angry enough they get lots of grants to run services so on some things they haven't got angry enough retirement age questions of dignity the lack of dignity on hospital wards is a crying shape you talk the lots of older people about having to use a commode with a thin curtain and everybody can hear and smell what you are doing can you imagine
moving personal experiences of your own relatives is that the way a good way to generate public policy doesn't public policy have to be more cool raggal
i didn't base this book on my own personal experience rational
they ill
they illustrate what is wider profpblgt i i have looked tat data the sort of are the level of malnutrition of people who go into hospital and how much higher when they come out that is not my family's personal experience that is hard fabg l. have looked at issues about there is no availability of public loos you are worried about being caught short so you don't go out l. think i have looked at the data and used personal experience to illustrate it and i want to make it more real to people
this isn't just a one thousand to one shot this is a professional sport a lot of people go through life doing things badly racing is important to me racing it is life anything that happens before or after is just
waiting just one moment hello
are you well
course when he takes on the challenge he really get on with the job l. think this bridgestone challenge has been just what the doctor ordered
four races four winners it looks as if it will be a four horse race do you agree
for sure there are lot of talents it is difficult all the riders all these four riders to beat them it is coming to be a funny championship
four that we mentioned which is lorenzo casey stoner and valentino i can't see anyone else in a normal race that is going to get anywhere near those guys
i'm joined by charlie and steve is there any such thing as an ordinary motogp raised
question of i'd do
valentino rossi could have been as fast as colin he can come put convert poll positions to race wins
a percentage player if he is not winning he is their or their about he is playing smart
his own way people have caught up his tyres are not working bikes not working but everybody is the second also faster
on the dani pedrosa point you have said before at least he has learned how to
one thing we didn't mention was gorgeous jorge lorenzo this is why everybody is talking about him last time during practice in shanghai george took this high side watch for the angle as he lands that is fractured he still managed to finish fourth on his return to barcelona he discovered he had fractured both his ankles that makes this weekend's crash even more excruciating can you imagine the pain during qualifying yesterday he had another mishap as you can imagine it is turning out to be very difficult to write keeping his feet on the pegs is tricky enough to ride
it was brilliant he had a nightmare start he fought his way up from nineteenth the rain came he came through to take second best ever career finish we thought it would be his first win but never mind that will come soon enough a career best four bradley
superb we will be speaking to bradley after the motogp we will catch get his thoughts on that podium finish we get asked a lot of questions as when the boys come off how do they managed to get up and walk away it is down to amazing letters boots and helmets as the clothes get more technical steve has gone to investigate amazing leathers being motogp rider is a pretty cool way of making living but it can hurt at this technology centre at the factory based in italy a new form of a wider protection is in development and being readied for its motogp debut it is designed to protect most exposed parts of the rider shoulders collarbones and neck to create ahead to foot safety system this ed baird system is at external pouch which sits over the shoulders a lot of the workings of inside this hump it is bulky but it does the job have alessandra the project leader when did this start
we started working on his racing solution in two thousand for once we continued acquiring the electronics and developing it to detect the fall of the rider
it must be difficult to make operate without the rider if the rider doesn't fall off how do you define where the bag goes off
depending on the type of four the electronics decide if it is dangerous or not at her critical could be the impact he bashed the type of fall
the type of ball how does this work
whenever the electronic fires the system the gas inside inflate the bag it is calibrated stitching
critical we hope there is a possibility to prove the system we
the beginning will be with what we had in valencia during the season hopefully we can give this system by the end to valentino rossi
but what does valentino think
i think they get the system pretty well some riders have had great success
it looks like they are quite ready to try it with motogp l. think during this season in some tests we will use the new airbag so the safety is the most important thing if you improve the safety i am happy
yes safety is paramount a nice crowd here at le mans were stopped lot of support for valentino rossi live pictures are of valentino rossi on the grid he qualified on the second row in fourth place here is how everybody else lined up he drags the bike across the line provisional pole great stuff casey stoner trying so hard look at this in practice he should have crashed at that ducati but he refused to have the accident and the drive it through the corner colin edwards fastest in so many sessions across the weekend but somebody beat him dani pedrosa on the honda finally does the job and paid the poll colin was given to try and get back is going to
drive no room for colin edwards
it has been good this weekend we had a slow start this season a really bad result in china no zero a small mechanical failure which has sucked but the bike has been getting better
how do you feel
if it does rain people know that you operate in the wet
de so far so good on the third row that is his old team mate john hopkins let's go to the man heading off the third row james toseland are you o. k. to speak
yes not too bad a good qualifying session just getting quicker and quicker to be put off the second row was disappointing but we can do with them it should be pretty good for us to the layout is not that complicated but it is very technical not as much as china you can see how close everybody is on the grid l. was the report nine of this morning and i was thirteen i was oh nine off
let's grab his team manager crashing into everybody over there and it has been a good we can so far colin is on the front row james has done a good job having to learn the track
sure for james this is the toughest time of this season a lot of tracks he does not know people do not realise how tough it is the mission to learn the track and to prepare the bike so but for the race it has done a really good job he is very focused and i am quite sure he can do a stronger race
are you happy with the said that even a fan
everybody is praying he can turn one of these qualifying positions in to a result
try to find and i will see if i could have a word with comment
colin how is it going what you what you have this big land a
i have been speaking to your team manager and he is with the weekend so far her why you feeling about marco melandri this morning how are you feeling
he is the furthest thing from my mind it is race time time to drop the hamman
what i do thinking about
the championship
a very necessary when we went there we knew we had to win at least two of the next three or four races and stay in touch we are nine points off the lead now it will be a great race today and italy in a fortnight is very important
that has always an amazing grace that is always an amazing race and was not quite dani pedrosa clear off
i hope not the players up worked immediately and his took a bit longer to come in so the first two laps will be critical so he will try to get an critical lead of us and start absolutely
i would use as exhibit a colin edwards he was pole position last year he got at of the first aged came in seventy eight
yes the brave ones will be on the outside who will be on the inside for the left hand side and the more mature ones will stay on the inside you can very easily make up three places lose the whole race by a falling off lose a lot of ground it is a critical corner getting into that corner is important first of it should be a
there has been some driving rain outside the door if it stays dry i agree with you i really want to see colin back because it is overdue but i think well with valentino rossi
i would like to see him take his first win but i think dani pedrosa will win for a stab what is your prediction
will that help james if it rains
yes he has not got a good set up they are not quite there
she never tells us her predictions casey stoner he will already be in the hunt everything is possible in this championship
in this series there is no stopping of races and after they have left the line everyone will be frantically getting the bikes ready for wet weather which will mean they will have to put the steel discs on the front they will be changing the strings as brings frantic action in the pit lane fuss that agreed aerial shot of
this they have short and the corner bit the tarmac is alarming them to run off because we had so many crashes last year
right afflict the stock catholic everyone trying to get as much heat into their tyres as possible really leaning the bike over squeezing the brakes and everything
else so pedrosa his starts are pretty good and he is on poll he has to get over to the left
yes we know the ducati he accelerates really hard so good so stoner could go to the inside
we are away a cracking start from colin edwards get the drop of casey stoner but pedrosa has made it stick a great big run from james toseland the second of the yellow machines james is up into fifth place somebody taking a short cut brilliant stuff from james toseland two places up l. can't work out what happened because colin clearly got off the line first but
could i turn here not a tremendous start from valentino but he is in the pack james just got shuffled back a bit vermeulen just muscled his way past it is rossi and vermeulen now or in front james toseland is up for a scrap that will be fun to watch stoner from pedrosa from colin edwards valentino rossi of course vermeulen and toseland
the ducati even on the short straight has enormous power l. think dani pedrosa was doing a bit of blocking he was aware of the bike close behind him closing the door again let's see what the honda does up the inside colin a way here now this is his best chance colin edwards can go faster than anyone if he can get a clear track he has got away well let's see if he can carry on
with colin it has always been that he does the fast laps but his racing is not confident enough
dani pedrosa is the quicker guide on the circuit guy dani pedrosa believes in himself you can see the body language it is more
he has grown taller in stature as
he has worked on the brakes you could talk about honda not having a pneumatic engine but we have heard
he has just put in the fastest lap he is close on the back of colin edwards he can generally passing
valentino rossi is about to
capitalise he very firm taking no prisoners
and almost holed out rossi close but no cigar
he is so classed so fast into that corner if he could get close enough he could pass stone on the breaks into that corner stoner on the brakes
is going to be tough to beat i still think l. am sure there is going to be a change in the minute
twenty eight laps the journey only four down so plenty of punishment in store for both of these tyre manufacturers and these engines and lorenzo's feet he is in ninth at the moment my eyes are still watering from that crashed yesterday
it was virtually barefoot water skiing the way he was skipping across the top of the gravel at that speed rossi there is always a concertina effect watch how much he closes in right in behind him if he could just get into the braking zone he could pass interestingly the tech three team they have changed to a wider front room for this meeting rimmer
that is valentina it right by valentino right behind us the honda and the yamaha particularly look to be more nimble than the ducati it looks as if stoner is working that bit harder i would remind you that at the front end of this field the first four riders are covered by zero sex of a second oh six chris vermeulen is on a bright blue machine that is going to close down into five way all of these guys are taking a little bit out of each other rossi downy inside
dowler the inside side by side this is a real scrap rossi just runs in a bit too wide unfortunately for him stoner get on his own and runs him out a new lap record for colin edwards at the moment
that is one tick in the box for colin these long off camera right handers seemed to be where the eberhardt tracks that much tighter off camber whether yamaha tracks that much tighter where they yamaha this is shuffle you have yamaha ducati honda another yamaha then it suzuki different
bit too much he had on entrants speed stoner is a bit slower on exit speed he has it
about right entrance speed on a tight track like this with different riding styles tyres and bikes everywhere has got their strength you get a concertina effect how will nicky hayden field about a broken ankle smaller testicles and everything else
he got such a great start as well dani pedrosa this is his opportunity can he get past he is much better on the brakes but nobody is as brave and skilful as valentino rossi of sticking it down the inside he seems to have a bit of extra confidence of
getting caught up in this as well colin edwards is also getting held up it is easy here you try it out there you try and breaking somebody like casey stoner for dani pedrosa to get past he has got to push the envelope just
that bit more sixteen points is better than a trip to hospital still eighteen laps to go dani pedrosa trying to take the long way round this is very strong he almost lost at the place de colin edwards in the process be
placed to colin edwards the place to colin edwards a new lap record for valentino rossi this is lovely down the inside but then he is on the outside he is handing out on your left is the ducati then as they got to the next corner
de that was a three
cornered pass a great move colin has
been studying what has been going on he has seen dani pedrosa run round the outside look at the ducati it does not
clever scientific stuff that is the battle now for second place between those brave those
three chris vermeulen fractions if he can just get close to those guys he can start playing with them lorenzo is not hanging around
look at the gap twenty six first of two thousand six hundred ninety five seconds dani pedrosa will have to get we go on stunning stuff from lorenzo he will not be tap dancing for a while but very useful in
sixth place colin is through but he cannot whole bit tight enough he cannot hold it tight enough it did not quite work for him maybe a dress rehearsal as the fuel load goes down as the tyres lose their edge began to the ducati wriggling and squirming
has he will be riding round the track on a bicycle at donington's ride of
man half fish let's see if we can get the bikes warmed up because if there is any more rain there are still blue skies lorenzo is phenomenal when you think how beaten up he is the last time around he was faster than anyone but valentino rossi
i know it is early but who said that he thought valentino rossi could win this i have no idea l. have a this short term memory problem lorenzo has got so little power in his legs and was not it is hard
graft on your legs this was the move a very brave move it would be easy for him to think
i cannot get this right if if i was chris vermeulen i would kick him on the foot
the white flag so you can now change your bike if you wish the riders have the choice to come men it will be tricky at the
moment they are starting to get things ready in the pit lane
this is unfortunate for valentino rossi the has a big gap he has i think you will lose thirty forty seconds coming in pier will make the gamble will valentino rossi kumbh mela who
will make a gamble if he comes in either stay out he could easily get it wrong you have got to have nothing to lose to gamble on this lot
what he won really want in this situation is for somebody else to go in see if they are faster then the pit crew can give them some indication i do not think there is enough looking out of the door there is not enough to even think about
he knows it is only french trained bound to be
slippery that is fascinating randy de puniet coming under pressure that is the battle for eleventh twelfth and thirteenth the frenchman is a bit frustrated he was hoping for better but as you have said before he has had a lot of crashes
yes the team has run out of budget he has got to try and hold the pace and he is doing it tremendously well it was thirty six last time it is now thirty one so he has lost some ground but he does not know how fast ago dani pedrosa can look up the track and seek the yamaha in front of him
watching dani pedrosa being able to hold up he could keep the ducati at
that was a chain bad luck for that
strayed over for loris capirossi
the chain came off the car was a kid that is so unusual the cat was a key kawasaki he is the one guy who cannot have any more moments he does not need that with a short gap to the next round prix italy
june first grand prix this is a good bit of this circuit
i think he rain has gone the
rain i think he can get through here fantastic the sights and sounds of yamaha can we just rewind fifteen seconds look around no rain at all
i think yamaha have
got a bucket above their garage guintoli is half midlander half frenchman i think lorenzo has forgotten he is injured i think he probably has remember i said you've got nothing to lose why not
he is now going to be lost even further and he is gambling it is going to pour with rain going to be last this is a mental rain it is horrible they are obviously picking up a lot more rain than everybody else in the grandstand stoner has got a grandstand problem stoner is out
the great problem battle is over stoner is out of it but pedrosa lorenzo and edwards furious activity down at yamaha they are
and drop driving reffing i don't understand which script lorenzo has picked up but it is the i am not an injured rider script we just saw the yamaha pits and it was raining but the ducati pits it is dry you have said this a million times oh colin fights back jams in on the inside of pedrosa pedrosa perhaps being a bit more cautious as the rain starts to fall
in china pedrosa was very good in the wet but he never likes these awkward conditions where you don't do what the pace is
when you're doing casey stoner fourth in the championship with fifty six points is going away with nothing here
beacon and a four casey stoner
the ignominy for casey stoner i think it was the drive system somewhere the engine still sounded
conditions he is probably the most skilled guy out there
if it stops raining he can afford to just
yes he would be in good shape so would the sky valentino rossi has a ten second buffer so would this guy it
is a pretty long pit lane rossi could afford it because he is nine seconds in front lorenzo just set the fastest lap for that only four laps left if it has completely stopped raining difficult for us to stay pedrosa will gather himself up again i reckon it is dry and pedrosa will have another big stab at colin in
the minute dovizioso has had a colourful raised he is up in six he has made good headway a colourful race can't say too much about toni
elias dani pedrosa's target is simply colin edwards he has two and a bit laps to go can he get past colin edwards and grab the final spot on the podium it would be good for his championship he leads the championship from jorge lorenzo seven points this would be a big knock for his championship as far as rossi is concerned these guys are the best in the world by some margin certainly
on that corner
he predicted he would win but a podium is good result
it is a shame we have not had both riders finishing the race james was taken by another rider but today it is a great result thank you everybody
it is an amazing results they have worked supremely hard that team it is a shame about james andrea dovizioso took his nose away
yes as we watch valentino rossi his bike was hijacked he is getting a ride home on his own bike i feel sorry for james of us not that is really infuriating because especially in these conditions it was a dog fight this is the sort of condition which james would have thrived in
without question the race of the year race of the year so far
with bridged jones they would well today bridgestone tyres were stock yes they did well today
valentino rossi said he wanted the tyres and he got them and he is
i am working as fast as i can valentino rossi will move in front of lorenzo up into second place in the championship one second i will work it out
conditions phenomenal what a start he has blown everyone away
was i could not get around them l. felt like i have more pace but i could not get through the stock but it was not a bad result
not a bad result it was great it
he got twenty
i have been working my fingers us to the bone
james toseland what a nightmare for the british rider after a superb start he looked really good he spent the whole weekend learning the track things had gone well
with him but let us see his start this he got a really good start of the third line marco melandri did not get away at all but james is up on the inside
here look at him go things are not going right for marco melandri james was absolutely furious andrea dovizioso made a cock up of it he came in then he could wide
we are really seeing vintage valentino
rossi strong and solid this is him down the inside he ran a little bit wide casey stoner says right you have left me a gap i will run you out to the edge of the track
another move from dani pedrosa an excellent race it was superb i think we can have a chat with the man himself matter is with him congratulations two went on the bands two perfect performances two wins in a row
it is a long time since i won two races in eight road we are on the pace we are back in business l. am very happy it was a difficult period but now we are so strong the lap with angel nieto on the bike was unforgettable ninety victories in my career a great number now i'll now we are also at the top of the championship we are trying to win so we have to stay concentrated first of it seems angel nieto can still ride a bike he is very fast he is less than one second slower than us
he is back in business
yes happy smiling that is special package riding the benayoun yamaha with the world champion or the five times world champion sitting behind you
after the chinese race that was not that exciting so many people said it was brilliant it was only because he won
was talking about how quick the tyres warmed up and how important it was
yes at the beginning everything got into place and then bit by bit he chipped his way through he did not have it all his own way casey stoner ran him out at the beginning but he is so solid
the man of the race for mate solid was all haler renzo was lorenzo an incredible result you must not know whether to cry or smile
yes i will smile because now we have to celebrate were stopped in not pay attention to the pain now nobody is really painful my body but mike personality is so happy my personality
the first half seemed more difficult and his second than the second
yes it has been raining in the middle of the race it was a dangerous situation for the riders it was difficult to keep on the bike
an an outstanding performance well done an incredible performance astonishing to be able to do that he had to come all the way through he did not come away well at the start this is him passing chris vermeulen that was a tough move this is him sitting behind colin edwards down the inside again that is where he crashed heavily on friday he has to be committed to do the same that is another one where it bobbles he was so fast pretty much everywhere he was able to pass
with the injuries he is carrying the have two crashes this weekend we showed you one earlier and he had that moment during qualifying because he could not stand up he would have thought it would have damaged his confidence but today he rode such a clever race
standings
there is the constructors championship courtesy of mr. rossi and mr. lorenzo yamaha are way out in front
we will come back to the standings in a minute a question people are probably wondering is quite does he keep it in his foot down
he is shifting his body weight around going into the corners what he does his he takes his foot of the foot rest you have to put your toe on the footrest as you do that the braking force makes your foot go out in front he adds a bit more weight to the inside of the bike one or two other riders are starting to do that now
he could do worse than valentino you can see the boy is preparing to go out on the podium hobbling jorge will be out there to stop charlie a great result for yamaha
up his first lap
it was astonishing boy is this deserved one day that top step a two times world superbike champion colin edwards he had his first podium for yamaha at this track in two thousand five colin edwards third again now lorenzo how about this as the understandably takes his time getting to the podium he started from his lowest grid position for the year not difficult because the normally qualifies in poll he has achieved the highest ever score after five races in this premiere class highest ever points score that is a magnificent achievement what about this guy valentino rossi as we just saw had the legend angel nieto double him around on his own bike to bring him back he has equalled the ninety g. p. wins achieved by angel nieto but he hasn't had back to back victories since two thousand six with the italian and catalan grand prix is it has been a long time coming grand prix ads funds fantastic stuff he is a new force jorge lorenzo astonishing stuff the president congratulated all the riders the boss of a whole world wide shooting match will provide the trophy to the greatest of all time fan club follows him everywhere they don't need to he has fans whenever he goes bridgestone first rossi trying to understand how it is put together seeing if he can re engineer it appeared as suzy was saying what a clean sweep for yamaha everybody is rather carefully clearing the country as fast as they can because you know what is coming next don't you those silly girls in red to but they are not getting out of the way well lorenzo of course is in a hopeless position he is trying to win a champagne spraying competition sat down loch he hasn't got a prayer sat down so rossi lorenzo and edwards l. toiled away long and hard working on the standings and i will now explain at hopefully prove my maths are right
the big shuffle in one race there wasn't there somebody that probably felt he should have been on the podium and he would have thought that from qualifying is casey stoner
he was struggling a bit going backwards but he probably would still have been there
line you could actually hear the engine rev ensure the clutch broke
he it was a forlorn figure coming in i am sure the clutch broke
he hoped it was going to chuck it down with rain
you never know
last year colin edwards did the same everything is worth it he is chasing his championship
james has also been shuffled down in the standings after that race unfortunate luck for him matt caught up with him earlier this is what he had to say we didn't see that on the screen
what happened dovizioso came past and went wide so i went underneath he didn't see me on the inside and came into the side of us we came together hard and i lost my front
i got off to a great start
physically no damage and you will be o. k. for the next one
phenomenally well we look at where
you can't wait for what
donington park
neither can live we have got some pictures of the incident neither can i it is the first time we have seen them as well
he just ran him out to the outside james was obviously on the right hand side going into that corner dovizioso just ran him out it is going to be it is not going to be a court case it is racing accident what james will take away from it is
getting dusty it will be cleaned up and this one will be put proudly next to it
it would be nice to have a word is one for while we thought you would get one a winner's what
it was so important to finish this race after two none finishes two creches it was important to get as many points as possible another rider is so fast in the rain it is his home grand prix half of me was saying come on and other half was saying no it's sensible let you have had some bad luck this year
you were
hanging on to that back group we had a couple of problems the start at the beginning was that good then i had a problem with my front brake it was getting worse and worse like you said we have had a bit of bad luck over the last couple of races the rain came in our favour yes second position it is great
looking forward to the next one
together and think i will not make the same mistakes at one point the at matt were jumping up and down saying he is going to win
he was lucky it rained he got a really good start in the second
half he is there or thereabouts
reckon he can do well in the championship
in the championship it will be tested this year to get it up to spec no news of riders we think they could be a briton
we hope so with john surtees gary taylor steve harrison involved i am sure they will want a chinese rider as well though
he said they would not have a chinese rider
i think there would try it will be tested in europe first
he had an engine problem it can happen
yes we will have to investigate but the bright side of the front tyre had something wrong the right side he had to keep the bike up with his knee it is very strange these players have been able to do more on the race distance in practice but it was not aware that there
last year so we are making it more interesting this year he has proved that he is able champion world champion he deserves all the best but today was not our day
it was not his day but it is leaving him thirty eight points off the top of the title which is a lot anything can happen but on the upside it is the first time they beat casey stoner
de trouble for him is it is really difficult because the guys at the front are really on form dani pedrosa is did your pick to win races
we do it was quite a nostalgic time recently at brooklands where the first g. p. happened
i was like a dog in a butcher's shop
it also vast it was frightening it was so vast the track was terribly bumpy very rough
it is unbelievable that one man came along many years ago and he hired a bike did his lap got his goal start and went home that was the prestige
it probably was it was a beautiful day even valentino rossi would be envious of me fantastic
he only went there to make himself feel young
absolutely right
it look like great fun
yes lovely and to see some of those old guys this is
that is my idea of bicycle that is what i am going to
you have all these different things coming into play valentino rossi great all over colin edwards managing the bike through the race lorenzo coming out of nowhere and casey stoner who finished sixteenth shovelled pack and kept everybody honest you have this four way tussle so that is what has turned the whole thing on its head that was a race like we have not seen all year
have the fab four turned
when you watch him on the brakes if you ride a bike you cannot believe it
the standing astounding dani pedrosa has worked hard to claw it back but there is nobody who can do it better
if you had to put your money on somebody to win the championship would you say dani pedrosa
he said dani pedrosa would win today
it is like being a school mistress here it will continue in italy this as you can imagine in two weeks time one of our favourite races it atmosphere its atmosphere it is always a cracking race valentino rossi will want to win it is his home race i am sure that you have heard the news the tragic news that robert dunlop was killed following a crash at the north west two hundred on thursday really sad news you were there it
but this is an incredible story he was showing his arm around
yes he said he could win the two hundred fifty race michael went out and won it l. cannot imagine the emotion and tears that went on in some ways it is a sad event but it lifted things
oh rene i could not sleep i was nibbling amongst the knockwurst and suddenly i thought of you

i hear someone coming quick hide those are the ones where are they going tonight it is secret dimnation filed at the eleventh ear
let's get out of here we vill be over the coast soon
also i am a good dad and a lovely husband can't i get that build up i'm not the champion
all the focus is on the olympic qualifiers but by no means are the finals here a poor
the national championships l. entered a tournament ones l. failed in the semi finals and i was gutted but then i pushed on and started working on my international game and focused on being the best in the world l. got a silver in the world championships of two thousand and do
macedonia that was in november last year multi national he stopped a couple of good boxers campbell is moving nicely very tall looks like someone who could move up a couple of weight divisions good footwork by him
that was good for at work from campbell the way he moved off those ropes turned his opponent third work he moved from a negative position into
he is coming forward in more or less straight line six to one now to campbell the yorkshire day idol a unanimous points win over jason cunningham yorkshire day title he lost to a home boxer in croatia thirty two to ten so he has got a lot of international experience good firework once again a sweet left hand on the counter by campbell
it was good
coming in you were one of the hot favourites did you feel pressure
no you have got to go in the ring and not worry about what anyone else thinks as the underdog last year up by won so it doesn't matter really but it was good i enjoyed it i won
lead up to the london olympics and hopefully win the gold medal in london that is my dream
there is saying in boxing that it is hard to be world champion but it is harder to stay there halam pressed are you by the fact that campbell could successfully defend his title
making a contribution to the combined strength and depth of boxing i three from the army trained by a man who won six titles
like in basketball and american football they should retire and invest after that when you win cameras medals and tournaments you should the royal navy other biggest sponsors of amateur boxing in england they sponsored by a junior tournament black and take it from me in two thousand twelve we will be talking after the olympics and four of britain's olympic medallists will have been royal
well and waiting for his opportunities he is then landing twos and threes
that was a good shot by stead the first one was just glancing maybe
not with sufficient force it was
sliding blow a single point between them yet again the a. b. a. sixty kilograms ground is still there for the taking a busy cautious round they worked out each other's style and it is all about putting distance between yourself and your opponent and scoring as you do so that was good shot why did it not score it was a corker right into the midriff that was the best shot of the round
lovely shot
lovely timing he's coming on to you a tight jab listen to me
this man has got to keep busy in this round stead cannot afford to rely on a single shot of he must throw more punches single shot
both men are out of their stalls stools long before the bell gary reay the southpaw they were both put their foot on
stead has only been in front ones all the way through reay has maintained daylight but there is nothing between them if it is even after four rounds all five judges' individual scores are looked at the highest and lowest are discounted and then the cumulative total of the remaining three it's called countback that may well come into play unless somebody can a solid punch will decide this title richie that went early that was a nonsense there was another minute to go that's completely wrong the timekeeper has rung the bell with a minute ago dear oh dear well done mr. timekeeper no supper for you i have to say what was he doing was using an egg timer how frustrating is that both men thought it was over neither man would have known it was still level this will add a bit extra to it richie but what a nonsense
a good shot from stead downstairs another one to the head
reay has gone ahead forgive us the electronic clock is not working thanks to the timekeeper but what matters is the scoring nine to nine it may well go to countback a single shot could win this is it going to be the man from durham is it going to be the soldier stead looking the more comfortable maybe slightly the fitter of the two the southpaw reay may be looking a bit anxious it is a long time since we have had to go to cannes back in an a. b. a. final countback a point between them it's all over stead has won it right at the end a most extraordinary round stopped in the middle because the bell went to signal the end of the contest when there was a minute to go but back they came again stead who had been behind for most of it did just enough good footwork by him that was the left hand richie
lovely left hook on the inside he also catches reay with straight right hand bang straight through the middle that is the right and
had to work for the last round
caught him with the more clear shops i had won
ward about when the bell rang early what about
i would have got beaten i knew it was not two minutes luckily they sorted it out
has that happened to you before
congratulations to martin stead the new a. b. a. lightweight champion that is the weight at which amir khan represented team g. b. with such distinction at the olympic games in athens four years ago he was the only british boxer to make it through the tough qualification process but how times have changed this summer eight boxers from these shores will go for medals in beijing in frankie gavin there is even a reigning world amateur champion a phenomenal achievement who are the elite eight this is by far the best talented group of boxers we have developed a culture of winning they know that if they are going to earn any money in the pro ranks they have to go to the olympic games and win a medal david price super heavyweight salisbury club in liverpool commonwealth games gold medallist tony jefferies sunderland light heavyweight european under seventeen champion james dougal london shepherd's bush commonwealth games bronze medallist billie jo saunders hoddesdon world number one at welterweight for under nineteen bradley saunders south durham a hero from chicago bronze medal light welterweight the hero of chicago world amateur championships he won the gold medal the first time a british boxer had done it he is from birmingham frankie gavin light weight joe murray the baby one of the babies in the team moss side club in manchester bronze medallist at the world champions championships last year bantam weight flyweight from birmingham city in the midlands the first boxer ever from britain to win a world amateur title are they the best qualified great
you have all got a bit of attitude none of you want to lose
it and talk it through we are there for one another it's good
go
get drawn against us a few years ago i can remember england were an easy draw we would be lucky to come back with a bronze medal now we go back and if we don't get all of the boxers into the final it is a disappointment
we know we are one of the best countries in the world now we can beat everyone
when you look at some of the top class boxers you think they are good but once you get in with them you think they are not as good as you think they are then you
we have now got more money on board than we have ever had before not enough by any means but a lot more we are now offering our podium boxers full time athletes enough money to live a reasonable comfortable life it has given them the potential to fulfil the dream that they have had when they first put on a pair of gloves
the olympic dream
terry has put his foot down and we have got everybody we need behind us dieticians weight management all the way through full time training that is the programme we have been given that is what has made us full time top class boxers
olympics you might be having your seventeenth bout of the year is that a
which is unique in british amateur boxing history it has never happened is there a bit of extra pressure on you
summer or the winter games where winning a gold medal is and the highest and the greatest thing you can do sure it is hard it is incredibly difficult a fantastic achievement for any athlete to win an olympic gold medal but unlike all the other sports once a boxer wins a gold medal he's got somewhere else to go he's got the professional game
fighting for my future and my family's future not just the great britain and my country but to make my family proud or whatever you do have to make think about the financial aspects to have the whole nation behind me and win a gold medal for my country make everyone proud it would be brilliant to inspire up and coming young boxers like audley harrison and amir khan to do so that would mean just as much as financial gain
fantastic achievement to get eight boxers through to the olympic games how do you rate the medal chances
it is not just getting eight boxers through it is aid boxes with a genuine chance of a medal in the last twelve months they have beaten and olympic medallist a european medallist a world medallist the world number one or in the case of billie jo saunders he beat the top cuban this doesn't happen you are sending away a scored not just having scraped through qualification a squad these are the elite the great eight on a good day with a good draw i cannot pick one of them who deserves a medal more than the other we could have three or four or even five medals coming back from beijing l. am not going but
one thing that sticks in my mind is the pain that you go through for every fight you're fighting the champion of every country it is against a champion every time someone who has worked to get to where he is you are getting knocks and bumps your back is sore and you have to fight again l. had four fights in four days in the belfast two thousand two world championships l. remember the pain i was in every time i fought my arm went my back was tight you have to try to hold it together five fights it is very tough l. really hope these guys stay healthy
i remember going in the changing room about an hour before david was in the final have known david
since he was young it brought
lump to my throat he was sitting down he had ice strapped to parts of his body he looked freakish he did not look normal he was knackered he was shattered but so was his opponent you came good on the night
that is the way it goes sometimes l. cannot explain what it is like it is hard having a fight and having won the next day that is bad enough but to keep going through the pain of boxing it is a tough sport to do it in a tournament situation is something else
most of the boxers here are competing in front of the cameras for the first time but that is not something you can say about anthony ogogo ogogo appeared on big brother and used his fifteen minutes of
fame to great effect to launch
modelling career but this kid can fight he is competing here in the sixty nine telegrams final we know about anthony ogogo but what about his opponent luke robinson is a recent convert to boxing having transferred from rugby league two years ago he is confident that his combination of strength and aggression will see him win the title it must be wonderful to see the number of british boxers going to beijing
it is l. remember audley harrison at the two thousand olympics then amir khan goes to get a silver now we have got eight it is crazy this is where ogogo's experience should come into play he has fought somebody who has had dozens of international fights and he should be able to control the pace
he is getting in and out ogogo but he is going in straight line he got caught there
mcloughlin in the quarter final but ogogo has too much
he has caught him he his hut he is really had
because the referee gave him a standing count it was a shot that landed if that point doesn't score l. don't know what he has to do he could have knocked him out without scoring a point
we had fun and games with the belt it stopped in the middle of the fourth round robinson will make a decent go of this bell his composure has been shaken
it has messed him up he is such a slick boxer he had all the punches in the book but this guy robinson has come out with damaged determination and great he is trying to weigh down the classier ogogo
there was the right hand tell me what was wrong with that
if that doesn't score i don't know what he has to do it was right on the button
this is not germany chaps this is bethnal green ogogo to his great credit came back at the end and that was a lovely long reaching right hand but he knows that this fellow can hit him there is what they are supposed to be doing they have those keypads and if they land properly they should be pressed but that knocked down was not recorded as scoring a point knockdown
robinson has not taken a backwards step and he knows he has to knock ogogo out
he nearly did it again with the left hand a great left hand from ogogo though
crowns bouncing off your head there were
this guy is like a steam train this is his style he is very effective he is not bothered about finesse and style he just wants to get his man l. l. loved it
ogogo's best and he keeps coming
ogogo has done very well with that round the corner right he uses his luck work for another point to pick up l. don't think robinson has
robinson is out of the blocks if this was a twenty round contest this kid would still be here what a great last round what a great contest all the way through no points scored by the unfortunate robinson but ogogo's
a lovely shot by ogogo but as i said at the start of the contest his fitness was really tested he came through it but you have to credit robinson he forced the fight on every step
he did exactly what he had to do robinson was so tough and so strong he showed his class dedication and fitness and he showed why he is one
he did a very strong kid l. l. was down but i got back up and i did what i had to do l. am happy don't get me wrong but i should have had this title eighteen months ago as a seventeen year old in two thousand six l. love the way i was tiered so i am happy you saw how happy i was a minute ago this should be my second title
that some very good boxers are left at home pool
that is the way it works you can't send more than twelve boxers so you're left with the situation there are five or six weights and boxers have arguments saying i should be there not the man who is going there is a kid from shepherd's bush who lives in champion lives in hammersmith
outstanding talents skilful powerful a fighter with style he has already won and may be a title and a lot of junior titles but it is his attraction to the fans which is most impressive he is not going to beijing he would be a contender in china he is part of a new breed and they are very good he could be a london olympics boy
there is nothing better than boxing in front of your own fans imagine doing that in an olympic stadium with the whole world watching you l. would love to be able to box in the london olympics in front of my mum and dad
in this club you have got a unique situation where the middleweight is going to beijing and is from this club you boxed him in the a. b. a.'s and beat him it is
couple of decades ago but i boxed eight times it is difficult it is more important than a lot of internationals you should always have to prove your domestic level if you win and a. b. a. title you shouldn't be able to sit on that for five years there are so many good fighters coming through when people do go professional you can't blame them they have got ambitions and goals they want to win the gold title as david haye or joe calzaghe has done it is a great achievement it is not that they are always chasing the pound because they are not always there
you say david haye and joe calzaghe when they are sitting down and relax in they say their biggest regrets were that they did not go to the olympics if they could turn back the clock forget the millions forget the world title they have that olympic glory
groups' opponent makes one hundred twenty miles round trip from manchester and he is determined to make his dedication paid these two guys have been room mates for england but now they are rivals not friends it is great to see james going to beijing to represent britain we have watched him in recent years he beat daniel sullivan from ireland it would be fun and games if they were to meet at an early stage
a good right hand from groves
kirkham getting caught while growth is turning it on he looks like he is looking for on the knockout not at the point he won his london semi final in a stoppage and his a. b. a. quarter and semi finals in a stoppage he is aiming to do that here six to two up in the second round kirkham holding
left l. think kirkham knows that if he stands toe to toe there is only going to be one winner and it is
he starts all his combinations with a solid shot to the body to bring the hands down and it is working a treat if he keeps that up he is going to start racking the points up
quite a pace richie can they maintain this for four more minutes
i think they will quite experienced but they can keep this up
cole kirkham certainly can't wait to get back into it karl kirkham
groves picks it up as he goes through the fight he picks up the pace and starts throwing better shots let's see if he does that
you need to face your opponent at all times remember oh there was an air shot in golfing parlance
groves has to start groves goes with a body assault once again there was a little incident at the start of the round that we should see more of from kirkham he has to make groves fall short with his right hand and get back at him
good pressure boxing from groves kirkham did well to survive it nearly scored with a decent right
kirkham did well to avoid a bit of variation from kirkham trying to draw the hands down a good shot by kirkham closes the gap to five and another good shot by kirkham well what do you think
this round he has closed the gap to three points he is hurt he has got kirkham in a bit of trouble and he is really turning it on groves when he needed it he conceded three points and to his great credit he came battling back with a couple of his own what a finish
a good finish he has got an in built clock groves the last twenty seconds he pours on the pressure
he turned it around he did exactly what he needed to do he caught a couple of shots he lost a couple of points boxers have a little computer in their brain and they know when they are losing points he knew he had to step on the gas and pick up some well needed points
that was the action from the start at the end this is groves having conceded three points in twenty seconds he thought to himself i need to do something special my word richie he did
yeah he did in the middle of the round he stepped off the gas he allowed kirkham to come back the alarm bells were ringing and he got back in control
look at kirkham saying come on is that the best you have got l. tell you this has been an absolutely cracking middleweight final l. bet james de gain is happy he is going to beijing
both guys throwing
he knows he has the lead he has to hold on to the lead
kirkham with a right groves comes straight back well blocked by kirkham
against the defending champion groves has had to work for every single point david haye
he really has it was a lot tougher than i anticipated groves has had to dig deep l. have not had to see him dig deep in the a. b. a. so far he has added his own way this time he has had to really work for it
a great atmosphere in a great venue and a great final in a great division
two quality boxers kirkham has had success in this round and put the pressure on with the straight left hand especially
good covering up by groves kirkham looking big and strong this is terrific george grosz has retained his title a very good run up george groves this has been one of the stand out finals of the evening in bethnal green george groves a rather nasty looking swirling underneath his left eye courtesy of some good punching by kirkham swelling
george for so much of that you were on top just a wobble in the last round you looked like you might let it go
yeah i mean the last round is always the hardest where you are up or down if you're down you have to go for it like kirkham did if you are ahead you have to maintain the lead l. had to fight inside for a lot of the fight the last round i carried in carried on with what i was doing he had more hunger because he was six down it made it into a good fight
you got the win that's what matters
exactly two time a be a champion a. b. a. champion l. am ecstatic with it don't tell james
long range against this kid there you go
not a lot behind it but it was a good enough shot he took one in reply the gap still exists baister must be careful if he drops the left which he has gone on a few occasions he will get caught a bit of holding there the second time baister has been cautioned remember if it goes to a warning it will be a couple of points added on to his opponent is he cut they are having a look at his eye his left eye a last a nasty little nick this is unfortunate because baister is in a commanding lead at the moment the doctor will see if it is threatening if it's stop on a cart no he is going to be allowed to box on stocked up on a cut awful to lose on a cut this
a lot of blood from the nose of harvey in a little bit of trouble he's looking a bit weary the huge flurry from baister has taken its toll on harvey he will be glad to hear the bell baister got him again around the corner with a right hand and again and again this is a good round by baister despite that little cut
i tell you what this kid harvey is as hard as nails he really is he has taken some big shots but he is still there and he is coming back
he is wobbling harvey his legs are all over the place that responsive flurry from baister once he knew he had been cut and he did not know how bad it was his corner will tell him it is not that bad at all the doctor said he was fine to carry on but what a riposte by baister it has been a very good heavyweight contest this joe harvey got his bloody nose clean up he knows he is going to have to stop his man to win this if he can make the cut worse who knows what might happen warren baister from sunderland sixteen to up looking very impressive on the back foot does baister just get on his bike he knows he has got a good lead
definitely if i was his corner i would say just keep his man at bay don't make silly mistakes this guy is going to come
here comes harvey good defence by baister both in terms of his hands and his feet getting him out of trouble good footwork by the big fellow that would have taken his head some way into the middle of middlesex if it had it good stuff by baister had hit
this is the better position for harvey
we must remember that baister lost by a single point to the eventual champion danny price last year in the quarter finals thought he might have done enough to get the decision price has gone on to greater things baister i think that's in front of him it has been a hard tough final but baister has
was always in with a chance with the right hand some great stuff what a good body shot there from harvey
it is all coming together now l. am boxing well
he had skill but he just kept coming and coming
he is a strong lad he was getting on my nerves at the end
had you feel
a long time
i wouldn't like to be a referee in that one
nine want to fury coming up to the midway point and he is piling on the pressure nine to one campbell is not quite able to cope he has been very game
fury's confidence is sky high there is that little time to gain from fury
a unsurprised that didn't count a good body shot from campbell i am surprised thirty seconds to go then two more minutes and fury is looking strong of the two he is certainly the more powerful and campbell has done well so far denying fury a win on the way to what looks like being his h. t. a. crown one punch could change all that especially
they have been some solid right hands at the start of this round the boxing is superb
campbell is looking tired now their hands are down a good right hand and again fury would love to stop this one if he can the referee has stepped in fury has to go back to the neutral corner campbell is exhausted there is minute to go and i wouldn't be surprised if fury could do this campbell has pride but pride has nothing to do with it it is all about strength and power campbell is wobbling he is ready to go the referee is having a good look at him one more shock and the referee should stop this
needed a huge gulp of air this enormous man campbell has done remarkably well to withstand this bazooka like barrage from tyson fury
would have found an excuse to get out there but damien campbell didn't he's done that and took it like a good one but tyson fury was too big and too strong and damien campbell lighting will have to concede that he was outgunned in every department
he showed a lot of heart and bottle look at the right hands from fury he pinned his man on the ropes there is that right hand what a shot that was a cracker l. was expecting the referee to come in there but campbell would not quit fair play to him but a sustained attack from tyson fury good stuff
did that go as you expected
yes l. knew he was a strong kid and i wasn't going to try to knock him out l. got the job
only a young kid big ambitions in amateur boxing
that will be pleasing for many people to hear because a lot off questions have been professional or two thousand twelve
two thousand twelve is my ambition if david price hasn't gone after the olympic games he beat me in the two thousand six a b. as just turned eighteen i had about ten fight
sum up how much that means to you tonight
it means a big thing to me this is my dad and i love him to death
the next world champion look here he is the man
look out
dad said it for
at the moment it is all about getting their heavyweight title fight with wladimir klitschko he is universally ranks as the best heavyweight on the planet l. am the cruiserweight it makes sense to go after a big man l. have met him twice and told him to make his fight happened he said a buyer will get in line but he knows there is no one else that can test him like i can who brings the heat who will go to knock him out there have been a couple of things i have been working on in the last couple of years and there are some great announcements in the next ten days it is huge keep your ears open for this you're not going to be able to mishit
you are not going to tell us now
not now but keep your
george groves kirkham had done his homework he had the style to try to beat their young george groves but growths raise his game when he had to euros to the occasion george groves for me him handling the pressure and getting that boost was a highlight
bouts they get here and sometimes they cancel each other up it happened several times tonight weasels and quality boxers getting involved in fights that were not entertaining but there were still six or seven good quality fight let's start with the big boys tyson fury he has been around for so long l. remember four years ago i was offered a piece of him as they say in america he was sixteen that is like trafficking children i got a phone call from someone saying if you want in on titan it is one hundred grand it is mad he is now coming on nicely tyson fury unlike george groves i liked kirkham i'm pleased to say he is back inside the british system l. l. loved campbell i loved the kid from the army martin stead who didn't seem to get touched l. also liked ricky newlands also that little light flyweight who looked like a giant against the others tommy stubbs zero was impressed with him when i go back over that it was not such a bad night for a thank you for your company at your contribution has been fantastic
profile has shot through the roof how other preparations for beijing
it has been unbelievable the amount of publicity i have had and interest and it is difficult because it is new to me have become world champion as an individual and i want to celebrate bit and get involved but at the time it was four months and now three months until the olympic games there is no time for it l. have got to put it to one side and move on and i am having to disappoint a lot of people but i have the ultimate goal to achieve which is an olympic gold medal and i can't let anything get in the way of that
then we are very glad that you have agreed to come down and blow this horn to start the race good luck with that and in beijing the man you will be doing with his is denis law virtually an ever present at the start here l. know you played a big part in the uefa cup here in manchester earlier this week can you sum up the atmosphere now in the city and the determination to keep going after the events
i think really it was a shame because the atmosphere before was absolutely fantastic but as soon as the problem came after the game the manchester people realised that the majority of the rangers fans were absolutely excellent all over the city in and around the city and it really was just that little minority that caused the problem they were not true rangers fans the true fans were absolutely excellent and everyone in the city will welcome them back any time
i was delirious by the end l. was exhausted l. tried to hold on for a win l. started running the wrong way l. have to make sure i do not do that this year
champion from osaka and margaret okayo some challenging british athletes too like liz ealing the way she ran the london marathon was awesome liz ealing
describe the difference between the build up to the olympics and not being on the track it is useful to run on the road in as far as making sure you do not get injured before beijing
it is good preparation to run that distance in a race with that level of exertion it is very good for
good to put yourself on the line
the greatest ethiopian middle distance runner of all time a gold medallist on two occasions she promised that she is getting better with her training and katharine ndereba the best female distance runner ever from kenya the best of kenya and the best of ethiopia jo pavey has got a task in hand jo pavey getting ready to one today we have got a strong field jo pavey trying to defend last year's title
it is about to get under way set off by rebecca romero and the great legend to his denis law ten kilometres ahead of them not only did jo pavey finish very closely in those world championships but she was fifth in the two thousand olympic games you forget what a good athlete she is she has got tremendous opposition here from africa and from europe jo pavey right in the centre she will be shadowing everyone as they head down at that gentle slope conditions almost perfect
it is a warm morning the sun is almost shaming temperatures are good for distance running these elite athletes have got off at a fair old
tilt the elite men's field now making their final preparations dan robinson has had a great month having achieved personal best and all but securing his place in the marathon at the beijing olympic games how does this event fit into his preparations for china
a. n. n. robinson running strongly now dan robinson
what is the occasion like and the event itself
it is fantastic it is fast flat course you are running round old trafford the course passes under
the back of the stand it is brilliant course there is always
twenty nine minutes this will be asked if test for and robinson we have some other elite athletes here the austrian record holder will there drawn next to him a former european champion all of these fellows are going to provide a stiff test for the brits
the best ten thousand metre runner of their last five years in europe and now the best cross country runner for many years seventeen european cross country champion he is going to be good on the track as well if he can get his form together dan robinson is in some big company here and the world champion at the marathon a man he knows very well luke kibet it is a great moment for the start it is a great moment for the city of manchester
last year
just coming up to two kilometres it looks very quick indeed rose cheruiyot not exactly stretching that leading group but she is certainly setting down the pace the second kilometre is very fast two hundred fifty five was yelling and jo pavey are on the far side the two britons up in that leading group liz yelling the intentions of rose cheruiyot look almost at the moment
the women's race under way jo pavey in nice position and les yelling right next to her in the
orange best best liz yelling in the early stages of the men's race luke kibet he was winded and concussed in by its in kenya he reckons that matters in kenya have affected his training like it has done for quite a few of the athletes it has been a setback for them but globally we will see the rest of the year unfold and we will see the kenyans do what they do
best which is long distance running guenther weidlinger it is looking very relaxed is looking looking through that leading group for dan robinson he is in there somewhere behind some of the leading runners luke kibet is at the front
former indoor champion at three thousand metres he is leading a distinguished group a gentle slope towards this point on the course and that leading group is stretchered away from everybody
we joined the women again and it is still rose at the front we are joining the women a big weekend this weekend for rugby in the premiership
the five the famous sight of old trafford the women have reached their in twelve minutes and thirty three seconds
the men have gone past the three kilometres kilometres still pretty fast point still mark carroll leading that group is down to about ten athletes one hundred seven is guenther weidlinger of austria luke kibet was the champion in osaka the kenyans have had a terrible time it with their preparations because of problems in their country a terrible time it very interesting race a very interesting race
to be a good running the men approaching a old trafford guenther weidlinger of austria is alongside mark carroll the irishman approaching gold trafford old trafford
on the left hand side of the screen is an interesting athlete anthony forde from blackpool he is running at with some a litre names he is running with some any leaks names a lead remains
the race is getting exciting some of these men of football fanatics and they will be looking towards moscow on wednesday night and the big match and the big match
if any of these athletes like football but they will not believe that they are running under one of the greatest football stadiums in the world still jo pavey is there still bizunesh bekele that second mattel was very quick that leading group is stretching out about ten to fifteen minutes
mohammed in the centre there are in a amongst the africans at the moment are in amongst one of the leading britons is anthony forde and chris thompson is in that group guenther weidlinger has led almost since the start
he gave up the steeple chase after that terrible accident in osaka and has decided his future lies in ten thousand metres i think that is a good move he had a very good opening
as we always see in these large events we have a record of thirty one thousand entries that was a record the two leading women are still there jo pavey was in danger a while a goal of letting a gap developed but she has come back looking at her watch she would have had a plan are coming into this and she has stuck to it coming into this there is a woman can race on well when it counts and this and more minutes this woman at
these two athletes have known each other from the olympic games where they finished in eleventh and twelfth places since then jo pavey has improved and the two of varying competitive are very competitive if today goes well jo pavey will not run another ten k. race before the olympic games can
jason girl jason girl guenther weidlinger looks like he has been in this race for a long time luke kibet is in the front as well juan carlos de la ossa in the orange and sergiy lebid are beginning to make a move europe's best ever cross country runner i am sure he can translate his form to the roads martinez journey macro and luke kibet in the
lead guenther weidlinger look at the distance between jo pavey and rose cheruiyot third place way way back nobody is going to touch these two in this sort of pace rose cheruiyot trying to get away from jo pavey but jo pavey has stuck with her jo pavey looking very determined
this is a hard race and determined a big test for jo pavey these two athletes have been through it before raced each other battled with each star that is probably jo pavey's last ten thousand metre race of any description before beijing l. am sure she will run well in the am sure she will run well in the olympic games there that she comes out that confidence booster can she hang out long enough rose cheruiyot looking as though she is moving from side to side jo pavey running
on a true line and running strongly the men getting ready to pass the same point as we saw jo pavey
at
few moments ago coming up towards the five mile mark gunther weildlinger is setting the pace but kibet has just gone into the lead
approaching the kilometre point this is the serious end of the race luke kibet tries to make the move the eight kilometre point is close to a five mile it is quite significant the five mile point in manchester two thousand and date in nineteen oh eight a man from manchester when it britain's only other gold medal in the elite marathon at the
olympics nineteen will wait london host city for the fourth olympic games and the setting for an unknown mancunian to make olympic history he stunned the world by winning the five mile race he ran with plaster in issue after the arch of his collapsed in his heat he remains the only british male distance have won an olympic gold his granddaughter has flown in from australia and an exhibition the central library reveals a man whose life was remarkable of the track than on it
here in manchester he joined the clarion movement for social reform that was vegetarian cycling club he cycled all round england distributing pamphlets about social reform he emigrated to australia in nineteen eleven he had the idea of setting up the first commercial radio
station in australia to give
voice to labour politics there once again with a view to social reform
it makes a story
i have had bit advance notice i would have got into training and participated myself
a great story about the myself great british athlete a man from manchester only long distance runner to win a gold medal with a plaster of paris cast in his you l. should have known that
i loved his shorts as
well in his shoe jo pavey for the first time has gone into the lead she looks a bit anxious rose cheruiyot is not giving up she tensed to rock and roll a bit in terms of her running style jo pavey is beginning to pull away there is a increased distance between her and they athlete in second place
the important thing
second place the important thing for jo pavey
rose cheruiyot and concentrate on her own running she is good occasionally glancing over her shoulder but she does not need to she just needs to concentrate on the run performance she is strong enough she knows that she been in south africa and in sweden training hard for this event is looking forward to the ten thousand metres in the olympic games metres in the olympic games this is a last event before and she wants a positive experience from it she looks strong enough to get that positive experience gap is widening jo pavey looking strong and comfortable looking as if she has prepared well many people from great britain will be willing how on in the olympic games we will certainly get the money's worth from jo pavey jo pavey has shown that the way
there is jo pavey's husband gavin congratulating her two of the great athletes from kenya and ethiopia crossing the line there is britain's liz yelling suffering a little bit here in the heat of manchester i'm quite sure she will give congratulations to pavey now back to the men's race de la ossa in the orange best leading best vest a farmer hamad from sweden has looked dangerous must after more hamed mustapha mohammed he has got world champion luke kibet for company he got mustapha of sweden for company just being followed by the world champion marathon runner look to bet
this would be the third in cab of european distance running he could get a double european victory sweden and austria side side pulling away from the rest of the world just coming round this corner you can see martinez europe's top ten thousand metre run up ever now coming into the finishing straight with a real battle on hand
when you think back to osaka the terrible accident winter wakeling had twenty smashed into the steeplechase barrier gunther weildlinger he is back and he looks very very strong he is pulling away from mohamed austrey austria being cheered on by the crowd now lebed is coming through and takes second place will hamed who was in the top two finishes into a place that was tremendous run finishes in third place we know we have got three in the top twenty but what the champion gunther the champion gunther weildlinger i wonder if we will see him on the track again at fifty million one hundred one thousand winters it looks well within his ability five thousand and ten thousand metres it looks well within his ability pinter weildlinger has certainly enjoyed manchester there is the second british athlete anthony ford from blackpool he has had an astonishing race here today a little bit off the pace running under distance but nevertheless a fine run
well done to dan robinson let's hope his summer of training for the olympic games stands him in good stead just check back on the wheelchair result we saw earlier on as far as the women are concerned jo pavey defending a championship we can hear from jo now congratulations the first women to retain the title in manchester tell us how you shoot

hello and welcome to points of view i'm guessing that summer has pretty much finished now we usually get five days in may then rain from june to september but we have got the grill on you anyway out there a gentle barbecue waiting for two channel controllers and a b. b. c. editorial policy advisor they are the people you wanted me to bake i mean speak to whilst i leave the coals to heat credit squeezes the practice of reducing the end of programmes to a tiny corner of the frame whilst other adverts and trails are shown is well shall i say not popular there they are credits rolling away at the end of a programme minding their own business and suddenly whoosh down they go to the bottom of the screen as if well who cares who made the programme anne stewart from yorkshire is one of many who e. mailed us in protest
i absolutely hate the credit squeeze because it is totally unnecessary people want to see who's just been in a programme people want to see the credits for the people who have done the work especially if you want to see the people who are in a film it's only been squeezed up so you can race on to the next programme with some brash announcer telling you something which you don't need to know you can wait for a few moments if you absolutely have to show what's coming up next a discreet logo or a bit of information in the top corner which doesn't need to be read as it's moving along everybody would be happy
now i can tell you they are having second thoughts here about the credit squeezes but this is a bureaucracy you don't get the boss cancelling them suddenly you get a review
we're going to be looking at how useful people find the information we put into the end credits and we're also going to look at the layout of how we squeeze the credits and the final thing we'll look at is how much people like the end credit squeeze or not it will result in us changing certainly the look of how the end credit squeezes work and it may also change the things we put into end credit squeezes so the proportion of putting a menu in there of everything that's coming up over the evening versus what's coming next
very briefly it's got five times as much pixel or detail as standard definition so you have a more intense viewing experience
one area we've been working hard in across the industry is to see how we can provide h. d. on freeview and the good news is we will be able to do so with some luck it's a challenging target by the end of two thousand nine
neil horton pointed out he can't tell what's on the channel
because over the summer we've got a heck of a lot of sport we've got the olympics wimbledon the chelsea flower show and great drama
thanks for coming in h. d. is unforgiving but it's not just bad make up and shoddy sets which are suddenly there for all to see the ubiquitous logos that seem to be stuck to everything we wear and use are also being given the benefit of h. d. which means they shine out of your t. v. with even more clarity and we get even deeper into the troublesome area of product prominence the subliminal or even bold placing of products and services where they shouldn't be british t. v. has rules on that doesn't it
have you ever been in an audi they were invented by fortnum and amp mason's she's here this morning before we have a chat here's her latest single now that you're gone
we fly on easyjet we've got your single here ten thousand nights you know you're in the firing line
which nancy goes on to become cameron mackintosh's leading lady in the west end is up to you
any product you use or hear mentioned should be there with an editorial justification that means there's a good reason why we're mentioning that brand name
in answer to michael kennedy how can somebody like andrew neil get away with these references to blue nun
it's a very very quick cultural reference that people can understand get straight to the point it's a piece of shorthand peter gale
wrote in about this issue of a celebrity agreeing to come on a programme in exchange for a plug
do you have any way of measuring this trend and finding out if this is getting better or worse
we actually have a continuous rolling piece of research which counts the number of products mentioned or shown
is it getting better or worse
third in line to the british throne is it prince harry
john jones from skelmersdale in lancashire who is registered blind has noticed quiz show hosts can forget to say what the correct answer is
the producers of quiz shows maintain the blind audience is not being left out
i would take issue with that we are extremely diligent in how we approach our accessibility for disabled viewers we are very keen to maintain the attitude of the producers and make sure they are completely aware of their responsibility to our disabled viewers and are as inclusive as they can be for example we will do pick ups on the night of the record with the presenter to make sure he or her has given us clear answers to the questions and if need be we will get the presenter back into the voiceover booths to redo those answers
that's the kind of response john jones had hoped for when he contacted points of view
i'm completely naked ahh
we've had bafta winning programmes like gavin and amp stacey compelling factual like blood sweat and amp t. shirts and more and more young viewers are coming to the channel every week
jane barford is one of many viewers really concerned about the number of repeats you're showing
lots of different people watch them at different times we had a documentary called kizzy mum at fourteen recently we put it out three times the audience grew each time we put it out so we took that documentary and were able to reach more and more viewers by showing it two or three times we think that's the right thing to do
we want thought provoking content but also compelling programmes that demand you stay with them programmes like that do have those qualities
we've heard from our viewers about programmes you've piloted they're really cross that only one is continued
do you take the ones with the biggest figures or what
no we didn't we chose one of the ones with the lowest figures
which was what we chose two phoo action and being human
we chose those because we thought they were the most dynamic all of them offered different things to different audiences but we don't have the money to fund all six we chose two we felt most excited about
many thanks we've got a further loose end to tie up from last week the nation sang out in harmony why was there so little music in young musician of the year here's the series producer steve crabtree to explain himself
we do take the feedback very seriously that we get and maybe in two years' time we can look at it again we managed to get a bigger audience we doubled our audience i hope that some of those people who maybe tuned in to the competition for the first time stick with us and explore some of the other classical music output that the b. b. c. does and then join us again in two years' time
ha way ninnies loosen yer galluses make yerselves comfortable in your armchairs and listen to songs of praise from northumberland what aboot that
fantastic he's said it all hasn't he northumberland's history and customs are in the spotlight this week we meet the family who are farming in a traditional way i get to play the northumbrian pipes and barbara dickson performs one of her favourite hymns on holy island northumberland can boast some beautiful landscapes from the rugged appeal of the national park to the majestic holy island of lindisfarne from where saint aidan set about spreading the christian gospel in the seventh ce nt u. ry and there are plenty of other reminders of its colourful history like this hadrian's wall some seventy three miles long it was built in the first century by the romans as a means of defending the empire nowadays it's invaded by tens of thousands of visitors every year keen to learn more about its history and experience beautiful surroundings our hymns this evening come from hexham abbey a short distance from here and we begin with all creatures of our god and king if you want to know more about northumberland's cultural past come to the morpeth gathering a lively three day arts festival which started over forty years ago
i grew up with the celebration of northumberland that began as a music festival but encompasses the dialect and the craft and the general culture dance and history
easy isn't it
we have live performance for singing music and clog dance we have craft skills on display in the exhibition within the town hall it's like a village show but in an urban setting
this is a local costume oh is it yes it's called a bondager
bondager no sniggering
we've got so many british traditions that don't seem to be important they really are because they're part of our identity and part of our culture you can see now we've been going for forty one years sort of man and boy you can see the next generations coming along and evolving the crafts for themselves or the music or whatever it is
leading the gathering's procession is local minister ron forster
it's so easy to say that we're all the same but to spend time in an area and discover what's unique and what is special about that area is so important and to share that with other people i don't think we have to be born and bred in northumberland to be northumbrian i hope that we're welcoming anybody can come in and be an adopted northumbrian this year we're having the gathering service in saint george's church and we're going to be baptising aidan who is a third generation northumbrian in the baptism service i wanted to do something which spoke quite clearly of god's care and god's love for each one of us and i thought a lot about it and when i was driving in the northumbrian hills it came to me why not wrap the baby in cloth and what better cloth than the shepherd's plaid i baptise you in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit amen which is a symbol of northumberland and which for me is also a symbol of god's love and care
northumberland has welcomed pilgrims for generations and every year a group of christians following in that tradition take part in a week long walk to a remote tidal island just off the coast
it feels very much like canterbury tales doesn't it a group of people getting together and walking along the road and telling each other stories and getting to know each other and at the end of the day there is an aim that you're going to in chaucer's case it would have been to see saint thomas becket's grave in canterbury in ours it's to get to holy island
holy island is very specially linked with saint cuthbert who lived there and died there we find holy island a very special place to end our pilgrimage we carry this piece of wood this large piece of wood from carlisle to show the world to make a statement as we carry it and remember what christ suffered during holy week
some might say you know it's just an island saint cuthbert just another saint why should people be making that pilgrimage
we need to go back to simplicity and saint cuthbert reminds us of the simple and important things in life we are totally at the mercy of nature and the countryside it reminds us of where we're all coming from it's still terribly relevant
it answers our needs now just as much as it did one thousand five hundred years ago and indeed we can do with getting away for a week doing a much simpler endeavour it's we need it for our sanity i think
when you're on the pilgrimage do you feel that your faith is renewed in a way
undoubtedly and i mean that in a very simplistic way
and there be no perjury in his mouth
my religion isn't any different to anyone else's i'm just a normal human being i just feel totally renewed and very much aware of god in the people i've walked with and in the countryside i've experienced
northumberland is known for its distinctive style of folk music are helping to keep that tradition alive can i come and join you yeah let me ask you erm what do you get out of playing together
oh it's a feeling of companionship and cos it is about the music and it is fun but it's actually about being friends together and playing together
it seems there are lots of smiles going on between you all when you're playing you're all watching one another and smiling away do you all feel that sort of companionship oh yes yes
while we're playing it's a feeling of terror most of the time especially in front of an audience it is and this group goes back a long time
pipes wail
i'm a natural but it's not just music that keeps the group together they also perform to raise money for charity and donate all of their proceeds to a local hospice
the hospice makes a difference in lots of ways it keeps us together and keeps us going and wanting to continue to do this but yes it does bring more money in there's no doubt there are times on a number of occasions we've been to events and somebody's handed over a thousand pound cheque now i don't think our music was that good so clearly that's been the hospice and it makes an enormous difference so it enthuses everybody pipes play
the inspiration behind robson's choice is their former tutor jane robson who died from cancer seven years ago
jane was in here when she was ill she taught most of us to play well all of us here in fact we spent a lot of time visiting and built up a rapport with the people working here it's good to be able to give something back for their hospitality and for the welcome that we get here
she was a pretty special lady your teacher wasn't she she was
she was very encouraging to us all and somehow she made us feel valued and that we could play the pipes she would really go the extra mile for us
as in all traditional music you need someone to maybe spur people on and we all go out and play in different venues and in the back of our minds it's always we know where we learnt it and that's really important
although she lives on within this group and wider too we know that we will see her again when we pass into the next life as it were and i truly think she believed that she had a great faith that carried her through
be still my soul the lord is on thy side bear patiently the cross of grief or pain leave to thy god to order and provide in every change he faithful will remain be still my soul thy best thy heavenly friend through thorny ways leads to a joyful end be still my soul though dearest friends depart and all is darkened in the vale of tears then shalt thou better know his love his heart who comes to soothe thy sorrows and thy fears be still my soul the waves and winds still know his voice who ruled them while he dwelt below be still my soul the hour is hastening on when we shall be forever with the lord when disappointment grief and fear are gone sorrow forgot love's purest joys restored be still my soul when change and tears are past all safe and blessed we shall meet at last all safe and blessed we shall meet at last be still originally the whole of northumberland was woodland and the fact that most of it has disappeared is evidence that the land has supported people for thousands of years well we can't go back that far but i'm about to meet a family just down there who have been farming here for five generations
i think we're very lucky to live here and i think my family feel the same it's not an easy life but we do feel fortunate that we live in such a beautiful part of the world that is quite unspoilt really and for one hundred years really you can look out of the window and it hasn't changed very much from my great grandfather's time still the same animals same kind of crops it's really traditional farming looking after the dry stone walls the peat bogs that are there to help to neutralise the carbon in the atmosphere
do you feel a connection with god and god's creation in a way
yes with farmers there is this innate closeness to god who provides everything for the animals and the land to prosper in the last few years we have experienced some massive problems first of all well i lost my husband and then foot and mouth you do need to have an inner strength that i think hill farmers do have but i have managed to perhaps gain more strength through the faith that i have in god that i have always had
were there times when you did question your faith
and they grow from a bulb don't they
we've enjoyed having quite a few school visits and it's been very rewarding it has
we've been invited to another farm next door
a good farmer has a responsibility to care for his land because we're only a speck in the world at this time and we're here to pass the land on to the next generation and we try to pass it on in a good shape as we received it or even better our father god you encircle us with your great love through jesus our friend and master
thank you for all your goodness to us the beautiful county in which we live the delights of music making and talking with friends as members of your family on earth keep us ever close to you may we grow in the holy spirit today tomorrow and always amen
look here this beautiful one such a satisfaction then you look at the flower and you look at the view and sometimes you wonder what is much nice
i have developed in i suppose in my knowledge of trees and shrubs which i know much better now but also in simplifying my design and really getting to the
this is what i like doing l. enjoy the fact i was going to flood the whole site in water and have water lillies as a main feature and a very simple yew hedge which leads the eye to the end of the garden with its simple her bayous planting and bamboos
are you happy with how it has turned out
it is wonderful l. have been assisted by a fantastic team and we've had great fun and moments of absolute horrorment horror l. l. am so happy
while the designers spend months planning their gardens they get just three weeks to build them even experienced designers like arabella feel the pressure so what have the last few weeks been like for shao fan a sculptor in his native beijing he's never designed a garden before never been to chelsea and never spoken english will his talent overcome his lack of horticultural experience together with lady davies who persuaded him to make this leap of faith he's kept a video diary over the last three weeks and before the build could begin there was
first buddhist blessing we were very lucky to get the abbis of the buddhist temple here in london to come and bless the opening of the digging today it's going to be two metres deep the deepest garden ever dug i believe at chelsea quite a lot of earth is going to be removed and twenty cubic metres cement is going to be poured onto the site technically it's quite hair raising for everybody
chinese plants that i need here in britain it will take a lot of time and a lot of energy to find these
bring this to fruition the rock in the chinese garden is a very very important element you can't design rocks as you would design buildings assembling rocks is a creative process because it
can't be fully planned quite a lot still needs to be done obviously we're halfway but that halfway point doesn't even begin to describe you know how much work
that needs to go in still we chinese hold ancient things in really high esteem it is part of our psyche we wanted to find really old tree because it is an important element the garden contains an ancient building and an old tree will go really well with the whole garden
this experience has been exhilarating educational at times quite stressful but i think that by friday or saturday we're going to have an extraordinary garden that will you know appeal to the public in many different ways not many of us have been getting much
sleep but we'll get there well lady davies you might not have gotten much sleep but you
certainly got there in the end we we certainly did
it's a stunning garden
thank you
very pleased
it looks absolutely stunning it's a major structural achievement as well as the planting are you going to enjoy the rest of the show yourself
i've already seen
quite a lot seen seen quite a lot thanks thanks for bringing it here thanks to all of you it has been great shao fan originally said he wanted no flowers at all in his garden he's compromised a little but his aesthetic is not one shared by the visitors to chelsea for whom the real stars of the show are the flowers in the great pavilion there is no greater fan of the floriferous than the first lady of
they're flowering so they're perfect for chelsea it's looking wonderful thank you very much wonderful indeed here in one corner of hillier's stand is this quiet contem plative corner it's damp it's shady and yet it's packed with colour there's wonderful contrast between these beautiful hostiles and next to it lobillia cornealis a plant grown for its dark colours just look at these lilies aren't they so beautiful there is one really special one on here it's got these long green trumpets and dark crimsome inside it's supposed to mean happy love personally i think it's a bit sexier than that dahlias in may who would have believed that they've really made it it's just marvelous full of this vibrant colour it's truly flamboyant look at this this is magenta star it won an r. h. s. garden award of merit last year and no wonder perfect in the garden hugely floriferous and wonderful contrast between these bright magenta stars and those dark leaves all these things are plants that we're familiar with things that we could grow ourselves it just makes you want to rush out in the garden and do it yourself well chelsea wouldn't be chelsea without the rose it's britain's favourite flower and some people come to chelsea specifically to see what's new on the rose front and they often make a bee line for your stand don't they david
they seem to yes we have been coming for twenty six years now
and every year there's something new to look at and this is a real beauty isn't it
fantastic the colour a really vibrant colour and a beautiful
i think he would he's very easy and healthy to grow
almost hundred years ago my great grandfather started to grow orchids and during world war two inevitably he stopped and after the war my grandfather restarted again a and my father started to grow orchids commercially and now i follow him the orchids i'm growing are cattleyas they are originally from south america and they are called they're the queen of flowers and they're so gorgeous and to me it's easy to grow that's why i
it depends on you know the grower's personality i don't know why i can grow for awhile the other orchids very well but i don't know why the cattleyas is pretty good for me
although harry has shown his orchids at flower shows around the world this is the first time
the first bloom a long way to go
well done not all the chelsea orchids are being grown in harry's glass houses his friend mr. morioka grows native japanese varieties including the aptly named samurai orchid which harry is hoping to take to chelsea the samurai or noble orchid gets its name from japanese warrior lords when they travelled on state business their carriages were garlanded with these flowers and the dramatic leaves are sword like along with his own orchids and the samurai harry hopes to exhibit the very best orchids from
the growers of nagoya these are firebird orchid it looks bright orange
gorgeous that's what they call vibrant any others
what are you hoping to prove by your exhibit here what are you hoping to show
it's lived up to expectations and welcome to chelsea
marshalls island in the sun the plants jamaica gave to the world and an island apart is this the u. k.'s remotest boatanic garden plus we continue our tour of the small gardens you want abundant herbacios borders and the kids want a football pitch plantsman chris colins helped in the design of the marshll's garden which has been drawn on by the children of primary schools across the country chris went to chris it is some of them
perfect kid's garden for the chelsea flower show some of the
stuff you produced was brilliant l.
want to ask you why you designed what you did
there is a tram po lean some tyres and the tree to climb on
boys moan they have nothing to do so there is a football pitch
what is the lost alien
it was like supposed to be an alien had crashed and his feet were still in the air
that is his feet there is it class we took ideas from other schools and sent them off to a designer he came up with this plan what do you think of that i think you have tkwot to got to agree it is a great plan gardening is not a classroom subject we will put on our hats and coats and look at the nottingham arboretum and look at some of the plants in there you wanted plants which were very tough so we could feel and touch them this is the first plant this is a japonica look at the leaf you can fold it up and if i let it go it springs out again it is good when you can climb into a plant rather than sit back and look at it get out george you'll get lost in theremate this is another plant this is like a lancer leaf it is sword like isn't it you can see why designers like them they stand out they are striking plants
they look like fireworks as well
didn't realise how much fun it was
restricted in our ways and thinking what i discovered when i did the workshops is that kids come up with great ideas
two of the children are here the favourite bit of the
like the lion
this is an adult taking on board children's ideas and make a garden
talking about the tunnel i have got to try it every year some designers take it to the wire and i am afraid to say andy sturgeon is one of them no matter how late he finishes this year's garden he better be bright eyed and bushy tailed come the morning he is joining me every day on b. b. c. one for our lunch time coverage of the show l. have to interrupt you
i will never finish
don't get any chance to speak to anyone beyond these boundaries here
on hand with expert plant advice my very own gardening geezer it is chris colins are you excited about the week
i am as usual the showgardens are an incredible standard the pavilion is full of amazing plants
so my boys will look after me this week give me plenty of advice
you will be latin names at the end of the week all over the shop
tonight set your alarm clock l. cannot have you being late tomorrow
we will see how it goes l. am going out tonight
you are so not going out tonight you get some sleep andy's garden will be spectacular what if you find the scale of the showgardens inspirational but overwhelming well there are smaller gardens which are less daunting there twenty two small gardens in hotel at this in total at this year's show ten of which are courtyard gardens they are more familiar than perhaps the urban gardens the
court guardianens often have
feeling of nostalgia the good gifts guard season a great example of the style this is an exhibit designed to evoke memories of nineteen fifties seaside holidays this attention to design is amazing the deckchairs and toys are authentic to the period but the planting is also just as nature intended down on the seashore we have things like the brassicas naturally found among the rocks and crevices clinging to meagre soils are ferns and the thrift the dorsets cereals edible playground was built and grown in dorset it is the most inspirational space you can
literally spell the flowers
cannot wait to harvest some of the fruits a high proportion of the court guardianens have chartible interests this is one example t. society for the protection of animals abroad is a recreation of mar ra kesk courtyard this garden blurs that interfaigs between interior and exterior you are surrounded by the sort of plants you come across in the heart of morocco with increasing numbers of us working at home it has never been more important for the journey to work to be a delightful affair here a curving path encourages you to explore the texture of the planting to be honest i don't think i would ever make it to the office one of the more dramatic is this exhibit from the cayman islands this is the first time they have been to chelsea because of the exotic nature of the planting you can find knit the grand pavilliian it is a celebration of the culture and of the plants this silver thatch palm which can only be found growing on the cayman islands and is a key plant they create baskets to ropes from it these court guardianens always remind me of jewel boxes you open the lid everything is there before you is the temptation with them to pack too much in
becomes too fidly you need one or two things which strike out like this cottage at the back
and the apple tree behind you that is where you need to get some height
gardening is constant battle against the elements forecast
which says windy frosty making
gardener's heart sink one garden here has been designed to withstand the worst the weather can throw at it
the front of the garden have been made out of driftwood by local sculptor called ruth fisher she has collected all this wood from the beaches round about it is lovely to know it could have come from anywhere around the world
this is bleached sometimes it is bleached in the ocean before it comes to shore it has been in the sea for a long time it has two different sea worm in it the larger ones and the smaller ones a really interesting piece shall take that home and live with it for
a while and see what comes to mind i found the people here hospitable but the climate has not been at times parts of the land are as far north as anchorage in alaska you can imagine the temperature you get this these parts there is wind up to one hundred miles per hour is not uncommon trees find it hard to grow you hardly see any at all rosa steppanova set up lea botanic gardens here she has been fantastic in helping me are winters harsh
of flowers
no gardening took off in the seventies with the oil before then it would have been mainly edible there would be vn shetland kale maybe some carrots perhaps
the willow to give shelter this is the
real thing this is the real thing this is shetland kale yard this is seaweed ready to be spread you have your rhubarb there and the daffodils and lovely old sycamore and there's the bluebells coming out this is as traditional as it gets
absolutely and see part of the british isles that maybe many people haven't seen or know about
some of the water is turquoise it's like the caribbean i have been up there
that's right it just makes the place look so beautiful once the with the blue

thank you
many of the foreign exibers at chelsea have established their own countries' horticultural societies here and jamaica is one of them this is the fourth year jamaica has shown in the great pavilion we'll be reporting tomorrow on the island's quest to win its first ever gold medal but britain's history and that of jamaica have been linked for centuries by a passion for plants both for the commercial exploitation and the diversity the land has to offer its plants are the very reason that the british set up colony there three hundred fifty years ago and plants have shaped its history ever since wesley kerr reports jamaica has never been connected to any other land mass it boasts a thousand endemic plant species including two hundred species of orchid this is an island of abundance before europeans first made contact with the indigenous indians this island was already known as jamaica word meaning land of wood and water for most of the five centuries since much of jamaica's wealth has come from the plants that grow here jamaica became the most valuable colony in the british empire thanks to cane sugar wealth from sugar funded many fortunes back in britain and the industrial revolution rum distilled from cane fired up the royal navy my ancestors toiled in jamaica's cane fields and sugar plantations like this one which is still mass producing sugar to this day captured from spain in one thousand six hundred fifty five the colony was underpinned by slave labour it was also a place for young freemen on the make like the irish naturalist and physician hans sloan he arrived here in spanishtown in one thousand six hundred eighty seven as the governor's doctor through him the plants of this island were to have a profound effect on british horticulture and world cuisine in one thousand seven hundred seven his natural history of jamaica was published it's an astonishing record of jamaica's people and plants this is his map
yes it is
so what's here a voyage to jamaica with natural history of the herbs and trees and four footed beasts and fishes as a jamaican botanist how useful is it to know all of this work was done over three hundred years ago here
it's fem nominal because it maps the history as it was back then you have this as a reference to read look back at these accounts and see what changes have happened between then and now
among his many achievements hans sloan has long been credited with the invention of milk chocolate but his book suggests he may have got the idea from the jamaicans chocolate is here used by people at all times but chiefly in the morning mixed with eggs found it in great quantities nauseous though children drink it here in quantities like in england they feed on milk he took the recipe home to england soon many apothecarys were manufacturing medicine known as sohan sloan's milk it was this recipe that was later used by cadbury in the nineteenth century it wasn't just jamaica giving plants to the world but the plants that have been brought to jamaica that have formed key part of this island's history port royal became a safe haven for pirates in return the pirates gave british ships safe passage through the rib caribbean and it was here that captain william blie landed in one thousand seven hundred ninety three seven years earlier blie had been appointed by the admiralty to go to tahiti aboard h. m. s. bounty to collect bread fruit trees the intention was to bring them to the west indies as a cheap year around source of food for the slaves but en route to jamaica the bounty crew mutinied casting blie and eighteen loyal sailors adrift in the pacific it's thought he'd used a disproportionate amount of the water available not to slake the crew's thirst but do water the
plants his second journey was
success on the south east of the island is bath where his bread fruit trees were first planted today it's home to the second oldest botanical garden in the western hemisphere established in one thousand seven hundred seventy nine today it grows prolificically all over the island but here you can still see the direct descendants of those two thousand trees that he brought on that historic second expedition
i know got to be a few lights out l. am actually surprised how calm it feels around here everyone seems in control
they do there's few late comers though getting things going there's a renewed kind of energy in terms of design something has happened in these last twelve months which has changed the overall forward view of garden design it seems to me
yes it's a high quality of design but also diversity design being applied to different types and styles of gardens some people digging down some building ups but there is high end design here
i have never seen people go down as far that's a first there's a subbasement somewhere over there
there's a tube station
that's why the australians have come straight up out of the hole really aren't they do you as a designer learn things here
every time there's a lot of greenery here you see and i think a lot of people just showing how simple and how green can be so calming in a garden there's a lot of green this year
it's interesting the difference this year with the green maybe an injection of colour red and yellow that might just happen after this year the nice years over you know that's all today has only been a taste of what's to come the real show starts tomorrow when the curtain goes up on the world's premier flower show
nicki will be back with all the
people are are suffering here more than ever in conditions like these acute diarrhoea and pneumonia could become major killers in a few days
the weakest are already fading an
elderly man is brought to
makeshift clinic gasping for breath two doctors try to revive him but without success his grieving family watch him die what better proof of the urgent task now facing the international community as it begs burma's
generals to open up today
british enjoy in rangoon said he saw a hint of progress
in the delta aid from britain gets through to the merlin doctors a child cries out as his infected wound is finally treated
this is very common we see after emergencies that wounds are treated but they're not properly disinfected or sterilised and when that happens it's almost certainty that the wound will break down and not heal properly
of national mourning for victims of the country's earthquake will begin tomorrow nearly a week after the quake struck rescue workers are continuing their search but are finding few survivors more than thirty two thousand are now known to have died and many more have been left homeless our correspondent james renold has sent this report which you may find parts of it disturbing if there's anyone left alive under the ruins in the town of beichuan no one can find them after six days you don't get too many more miracles here rescuers break through the rubble of a hotel this man is hoping to find his thirty two year old son he's asked rescuers to search because he's convinced his son is still alive
the day before yesterday we called my son's mobile phone and we got through but we could only hear breathing very weak breathing
it is a national disgrace that in this country a major criminal investigation was stopped following political interference in order to protect commercial interests whereas in the united states the prosecutors are being allowed to get on with their job
morning well i just feel brilliant for everybody in portsmouth and gould old harry
king harry they're calling him riding his double decker chariot among the seafront with so many loyal subjects in the way the bus often had to stoop
i've never seen anything like it it just shows you what has been accomplished by these people
have you been this happy people before
this ain't going to be easy
not as easy as it used to be
harrison ford is sixty five years old many are credible he can be for a young audience is it relevant as an issue
it's not relevant to me l. do what's required in a character
the international olympic committee is visiting the capital this week to make sure we're on track to host the games since they last checked there's opinion a few changes in london namely a new mayor and a new approach the conservatives have been scathing about the rising cost of the london olympics so now that we have a tory mayor can we expect stronger assurances that the budget's under control boris johnson's always pledged any extra costs will not be picked up by
a lot of them actually see the t. v. from monday onward they see lot of buildings have collapsed burying a lot of children underground and see the people pulling out one by one and they see that if they can don't whatever they can do then that we help the effort greatly
now it wasn't entirely unexpected but the news that walthamstow stadium is to close has stunned the world of greyhound racing the sport has seen a decline in popularity and fans fear this latest closure will mean it could sphere altogether it's known as the ascot of the greyhound world and and its famous neon lights have become one of the capital's most recognised landmarks now the rumours have been confirmed and seventy five years of dog racing here is coming to an end walthamstow stadium has been part of the chandler family since nineteen thirty three over the years thousands have enjoyed the unique style of the venue in east london but it's now been sold to a group of developers the chandlers say it's a decision because of a fall
she's not very happy about it but there's nothing she can do so if the owner said it will close down it will close down
what have you had now
pilot john rooney and his crew are about to save someone's life whisky bravo's been scrambled the mast on a yacht has collapsed the rigging has ripped loose a cable and slashed through a crew member's leg like a cheese wire
rescue whisky bravo we've been told it's been severed to the bone over
if the cable has sliced a main artery a pint of blood can be lost every thirty seconds
there's quite a few yachts ahead of us here which is not what we need
the yacht is taking part in a race and finding the casualty amidst this sea of sails won't be easy
whisky bravo the vessel we're communicating with is called twin wakes he's standing by
somewhere the race organiser is circling the casualty in the hope that whisky bravo will spot them
whisky bravo twin wakes if you will turn right i have a man on the rear deck pointing there's one with his hands wide open on the deck of the casualty vessel
but whisky bravo can't get a fix on them
we don't know where you are
if they don't find the casualty soon he could bleed to death
good afternoon cornwall it looks as if the clouds have finally parted and the sun is pushing through get down on the beach while it lasts and remember to be safe out there
the sun has finally brought out the surf lovers at perranporth beach the rnli have got their work cut out keeping it all safe
the surf is so unpredictable a sudden change can happen in seconds one minute you can have a nice calm day and all of a sudden flash rips undercurrents anything can happen within seconds
perranporth is renowned for its strong currents that can drag a swimmer out to sea lifeguard luke essery has got to play it tough to keep the wave lovers from wandering out beyond the flags sandy hill is on the jet ski as back up and already she has spotted a surfer in distress he's caught in a rip current if sandy doesn't get to him he'll be dragged further and further out to sea
climb on climb on the current just took your feet from under you there was no way you could get your feet back on the ground and the waves just got bigger and bigger and pounding you you get tired very very quickly without realising it and once i started drifting that was it i just couldn't get back in at all there's no way that you can fight against it it's just too much
this is not a good sign with a rip current just outside the flag zone anyone who strays could get into danger
it gets really frustrating and gets on our nerves a fair bit they don't pay any attention they just think they know what they're doing pretty much they are the people who we are always rescuing
luke and sandy are going to have to lay down the law
if you would turn right come back towards us
whisky bravo is still looking for the man with a severe leg injury
he's just behind us over there he is
any blood loss must be stemmed before they can even think of moving him
shall i just orbit for the moment john no come down next to him
john spencer must get down to put pressure on that wound the winch operator signals to the race organiser to get out of the way
in that position he's going to be a battle to get in the aircraft quite a few yachts ahead of us john
whisky bravo will conduct the winch from a greater height than normal to stop the casualty from being blasted by the down wash
forty five forty feet clear the winch i'm ready
john's out the door what height you want to go to i'm going to go to eighty feet
we are moving left to right steady steady
when winching from a height it's hard to keep the line stable
steady steady
the only way to stabilise the line is to drop john in the sea
his first priority is to get pressure on that wound
you've got that tight have you i'm gonna have a look at your wound what i want you to do is ease that off can i open these jeans up let me get my knife out mind your hands out the way
straight to the bone let's get that pad up that
let's get this on it
you're doing fine that's really good
this may be agony for the casualty but it is essential fairly tight as i hold the pad on the bandage is only a temporary measure they must get him to hospital for immediate surgery
whisky bravo the guy is obviously in a great deal of pain so what is it
it is a slice through his thigh is it quite a bad laceration is it
very bad we're gonna need the stretcher down here because the guy's leg is in a great deal of pain so if you can get the stretcher down
his leg must be immobilised but getting him on to the stretcher is going to be tough
that was good that was good
everybody needs to pull together to get the casualty safely out of here back in perranporth luke is pumping up the volume on his message
can i have your attention in the water please a few body boarders drifting outside the area once again if you are swimming bathing or body boarding your safe area is between the two red and yellow flags your co operation was much appreciated thank you the rips riding pretty strong so we try and keep doing p. a.'s for their own safety
but it's not long before sandy is on another rescue
come right up hold the top one climb on climb right up right up
maybe i was a bit stupid in trying to get one more wave but yes there was a security blanket i guess and it was a good thing to know they were there
they are always there for the lifeguards safety is paramount
yeah just kind of paing them and warning them but it wasn't enough where we had the flags on that bank you probably don't feel the pull as much but as soon as they go a couple of metres to the right then they suddenly feel it that's when they start to panic and we have to pick them up pretty quickly
with so many holidaymakers ignoring the lifeguards something has got to give
the currents are still there and still very strong
there's one solution but it's drastic moving everyone away from the rip current but it's high season and there are ten thousand people here in the solent john and his helpers are ready to put the casualty on the stretcher
forward eight forward six reduce speed forward five
moving him without causing him more pain is impossible but the biggest risk is that the wound will tear even more
steady contact steady steady
another foot edward come on edward that's it you're nearly there
there we go right give me that other strap
ed must be securely fastened through a failsafe system of cliplocks
right that that that
ready for pick up fully forward what's gonna be your height john about eighty feet that's your height good then
right two of you fending off here in case we snag on anything right you two fend it off there i'm going to fend this leg as best i can
did you say you've got something for the pain yeah here we go mate breathe yeah just breathe it in nice deep breaths
solent rescue whisky bravo we have the casualty on board now
whisky bravo solent that's received
he was in hospital in minutes and rushed into surgery on the other side of the solent another emergency two people are sinking in a kayak miles out at sea
lymington lifeboat solent coastguard roger you are launched to recover two persons on a submerged boat there is one male and one female and we understand the female is very very cold
the two casualties have already being trying to keep their heads above water for twenty minutes
solent coastguard this is the lymington lifeboat we're launched on task
it may be summer but the solent is still cold enough to kill
lymington lifeboat lymington lifeboat solent coastguard roger
the lifeboat is informed that a passing yacht has pulled the casualties out of the water
the sunsail forty one they've taken the two persons on board their own vessel and you should encounter them on your way we are going to get an ambulance to the harbour pontoon as we understand the female is very very cold
the lifeboat tries to make contact with the yacht
sunsail forty one this is lymington lifeboat over no
but there is no response now they can only hope that the yacht will spot them but it's an empty horizon ahead
sunsail forty one solent coastguard confirm whether or not you can see the lifeboat yet over
they haven't seen us yet
in perranporth the lifeguards have finally bitten the bullet ten thousand people are on the move
get out of the sea and walk up on the sand
can you move to swimming over there because there are rip currents here the rips are going to be a lot stronger for everyone's safety we're trying to get everyone out of the water
the lifeguards have found an area where there are no rip currents
at this stage now we've moved to the other side now
it's pretty safe for the moment we'll probably have to reassess later on but now it's fine we've still got the jet ski in the water yeah for now it's all right we'll see how it goes
peace has returned to perranporth for now
over there
in the solent a breakthrough
sunsail forty one we have visual
dead ahead over
two people had been in the water for twenty minutes as their kayak sank they are cold and very shaken
i'm just gonna try and keep the wind off you
there we go
they're just very very cold we'll get them into the boat house and keep them warm there
the casualties were taken straight to hospital and made a full recovery thanks to the quick response of the lymington lifeboat team it's still packed at perranporth and the lifeguards are keeping a sharp eye on the water but it's on the beach behind them that somebody is in distress
i want my mummy
this little girl has lost her mum
i want my mummy
she's determined to find her but won't let anyone help
do you want to come with me no she's really really distressed
yeah she's obviously lost yeah
it's up to lifeguard annabel barsch to reunite this little runaway with her parents
she won't let us anywhere near her and she's very young she's probably been told by her parents not to speak to strangers but we're only trying to help her i've got to keep an eye on her she's running off at the moment
never known a girl like you before
but trying to escort this little bundle of determination back to the lifeguard base is almost impossible on the dorset coast another full scale emergency is in operation
the most important thing is a rapid evacuation over
two rnli lifeboats and whisky bravo have been scrambled
no pulse at this time over no pulse that's not good
a man on a fishing trip has collapsed clutching his chest
if there's no pulse are they trying to resuscitate him
portland coastguard yes we are currently engaged in a link call with the doctor at the hospital
but with no doctor on the boat everyone's racing to save the man's life
is that it that little black dot at the side of chesil beach
yeah you're right
yeah it's hard up against the beach it's there
the casualty has regained consciousness but he's unstable and needs to get to hospital before he collapses again
you are clear to winch
clear the aircraft and winching now pins removed let's go forward five and right
the lifeboat steers clear so that alf kitwood can be winched down
forward one and right and steady on the deck
what have you had now yes please yeah i'll take that with me can you get that for me
the boat crew have treated the casualty for angina
that's all right we'll give him a proper check in the aircraft put your arm through there
his symptoms could mean he's had a heart attack
that one through there just nice and gently nice and easy that's it well done
he looks quite elderly doesn't he
i'm gonna put these straps round you when the cab comes back we'll be gently lifted off
brian shorocks is sixty six years old and in his fragile condition a winch can only add to the trauma
if you're about ready for us
but whisky bravo can get brian to hospital much faster than the lifeboats at perranporth annabel's attempts to reunite the little girl with her mum aren't going to plan
my mummy might be in my car
they are a long way from the base and heading in the wrong direction
i want to go to see them now
this little girl's running up droskin's steps now she's adamant she's not coming back down to the beach she won't let me get hold of her
annabel if you can keep an eye on her stay with her for the moment just try and calm the situation down over
antonia can you let me take you back to the lifeguard hut your parents will come there to look for you
i want to see if my car's still here
it's becoming clear that antonia is frightened that her parents have left perranporth without her
will you let me pick you up and take you back to the lifeguard hut
and when she can't find their car it's all too much
mummy mummy they won't have left without you
they won't have left without you this is annabel over
can you put a call through to the police station please over
out at sea brian is bracing himself for the winch
starting winching now forward twenty and descending and steady steady contact and forward and turn and steady keep clear of the deck clear the deck clear the deck coming up slowly at the door and in the cabin
he is given medication immediately to ease the strain on his heart he is just minutes from hospital
i'm cold i'm just looking see if you can see her across there
antonia is clinging to one last hope that her parents haven't abandoned her but she can't see them
it's all right they won't have left without you antonia
they will they won't
they are running out of options but then there's a breakthrough
hi there it's perranporth lifeguards here we've just reported a child we had found which she's lost her parents
antonia's mum has been found
you were going to send out a unit to us
well i thought she was playing with her brother then he come back on his own so we went down there and looked for her i walked all along here it's just so she knows the car's up there because it's up on that hill up there she's quite determined a lady found her i followed her the whole way to make sure she was all right
my mummy's here
i told you not to wander off didn't i
i said you'd find her didn't i you found her thank you just to let you guys know that we have found the mother and they're being reunited by the stream were you scared you weren't scared we did think we'd lost you
yeah where's our car mummy
our car's right up there on that hill isn't it
i thought it was on the roof
don't be silly
and it's not only the lifeguards who are always there to keep our coastline safe
it's quite a bad laceration is it very bad ready for winching line
for winchman john spencer the rescue of the man with the gashed leg was all in a day's work
it was a very serious injury you're really got to get on with it and get the job done
you two fend it off there i'll try and fend this leg the best i can
it makes it a lot easier to work as a team to achieve the task of getting him safely airlifted
and as for ed he's having intensive physiotherapy to regain the full use of his leg
and brian was eventually diagnosed as having suffered a heart attack
if it wasn't for them well i might not be here might i
but happily he made a full recovery
i'm extremely grateful to them brilliant i don't think i'd be brave enough to do it
next time on seaside rescue the crew of whisky bravo rescues two divers in trouble
your head is gonna need stitches
and the lifeguards help a grandmother with a nasty head injury
never in his life had he seen a river before a sleek sinuous full bodied animal chasing and chuckling gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free the mole was bewitched entranced fascinated
kenneth grahame's the wind in the willows is as popular today as ever its endearing characters and idyllic waterfront setting have enchanted generations of children and adults alike grahame was in love with the english countryside and would exchange his desk at the bank of england for the banks of the thames as often as possible in front of grahame's boathouse is this golden weeping willow its prominence has led to speculation that it is the very tree that inspired the title of grahame's much loved storybook the view from the boathouse is magical it's inspiring a new generation
i come down here as often as i can to write and also to relax it's the most perfect location i'm sure that's why kenneth grahame chose it to stay in and to write in it's just got such a magic and charm about it willows grow well on a riverbank because they have an invasive root system and they love water it's a great source of nutrients to make them grow well it's got wonderful bark you almost want to hug it really it's a lovely tree and it looks so good just dipping in the water the girth on this is quite large i can't hug it with two hands so it would have been here easily when he wrote wind in the willows such an inspiration for such a wonderful book but with all the other buildings around here you can't see it in the original setting that inspired him to put rat badger and mole here
the golden weeping willow is only one of nineteen varieties of the tree and whilst its role is primarily ornamental its relatives in the salix family provide the key ingredient of aspirin and also fine cricket bats the romanticised tale of the willow's arrival on the thames tells of the first tree being cultivated from twigs used as packing in a parcel sent from spain and planted in twickenham by the poet and amateur garden designer alexander pope in reality the golden weeping willow is a hybrid and this specimen may well have originated from n. america rather than babylon or china as is often thought
this tree didn't come in naturally it was a fashionable tree to plant willows take very easily from cuttings it was probably just a branch pushed into the ground which may have taken off from that it seems a fairly healthy tree it's had one limb off it that was probably more to do with wanting to remove it structurally from overhanging nearby buildings but it looks vigorous and healthy it's rather an unusual tree actually there are other pockets of this tree in cheltenham and over in essex but it's actually not as common as one would imagine it's very similar to the cricket bat willow in the nature of the wood a large cricket bat willow would have very fissured bark as this weeping willow has the book wind in the willows does give a strong feeling of community the various animals visit each other in different parts of the area there's definitely the feeling of a community not far away from where ratty is living ratty talks about all the friends and the bank actually positively becoming overcrowded really so there's a strong feeling of the characters being among other people and things going on around them often willows are cultivated because of their stem colour during winter and on this particular tree you can see the lovely golden yellow stems
as is so often the case in britain's ever changing landscape this tree's provenance is difficult to confirm but now botany is beginning to cast doubt on whether this tree could have inspired wind in the willows
wearing my rolex by wiley how you doing whoa

how i am defying gravity
reach for the stars climb every mountain high reach for the stars
how do i live without you
comfortable with
please welcome our former josephs and present nancys dancing in the street they're dancing dancing in the street dancing in the street quite an evening and our nancys are here with me now a week from the semifinal the panel are getting very very serious niamh and jessie both of you had the comment about strength and were you strong enough to play the role how do you respond to that
it is hard getting comments like we're all actress i would think we all have the strength to play whatever age i should probably apologise to barry that i can't grow any taller
what about
you i agree with niamh what is so interesting is that we have been training for the past eight weeks every single one of our voices is so strong i know all of us could do eight shows a week in the west end i know i can prove myself next week
i can't believe three of us are going to be oliver in the west end
you could officially be oliver
i would love to be one of the three olivers and there isn't a word in the dictionary to describe how much i would like to
be oliverit would would be like a dream to be oliver and perform in the west end cross my tingers every night
reach i want my talent to be revealed to everyone
i'm so close to winning my favourite role and it would send me over the moon
i really want this so much it would be such an amazing experience i feel really honoured
and thirteen i'm so excited i got picked i play the drums my favourite artist in the charts at the moment is probably adele she might make a good nancy now i have to impress andrew and cameron to show i can be in the final three
cuss good time girl who likes
racous good time girl who like as laugh we packed the girls off to see if they had the comedy finesse to lead the cast of oliver it's time for the girls to locate nancy's funny bone who better to
help find it than the writer of
new west end comedy life coach and comedian phil jupiter they want to see if the nancys can make them laugh
first tell us a joke you will be on the stage we will be in the auditorium
this is nothing other than an excuse for me to get more material
i'm not funny
jodie will do well
i'm nervous people laugh at me
knock knock
who's there
bourne of lack of preparation up until they went on stage and told
do i need to get changed
this is a cheese shop
jessie could do with more work than others the sincerity was great she was scary
can i see a receipt he's a good laugh
i would like a refund for shirt
your shirt wants a refund
what rachel did that the
you are bringing back someone else's shirt
she was the most realistic sam in way looked too comfortable she's a strong presence and that character is a very weak character
i have a dry sense of humour
let's do it again the other way round
i don't really know if i was funny people laughed but it might have been out of pity
jodie fantastic you would work any time niamh was the real surprise really interesting quality very good
very impressive to see it up close and personal talented young women
here performing from south pacific i'm gonna wash that man right mchair and hoping their performance will be head and i'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair i'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair i'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair and send him on his way i'm gonna wave that man right outta my arms i'm gonna wave that man right outta my arms i'm gonna wave that man and send him on his way don't try to patch it up tear it up tear it up wash him out dry him out push him out fly him out cancel him and let him go yeah sister i'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair i'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair i'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair and send him on his way if the man don't understand you if you fly on separate beams waste no time make a change right off your range rub him outta the roll call and drum him outta of your dreams if you laugh at different comics if you root for different teams waste no time weep no more show him what the door is for rub him out of the roll call and drum him out of your dreams oh no oh no i went and washed that man right outta my hair i went and washed that man right outta my hair i went and washed that man right outta my hair and sent him on his way i went and washed that man right outta my hair i went and washed that man right outta my hair i went and washed that man right outta my hair and sent him on his way good clean fun ladies thank you very much barry who stood out for you in
going to wash their hair i'm not going single anybody out i thought you did very well jodie i thought you carried it that is the last time you will see all five nancys perform together as a group next week we will be down to four the sing off is coming up your votes have already decided who is in the bottom two but who do our nancys think deserves to be the next to lose her locket
the person i think isn't nancy based on this week's performance is jessie i think her performance lacked depth
niamh is not my nancy hugely successful pop career but not nancy in my eyes
the personal i don't think is nancy is niamh it wasn't the right song to show her nancy trait
i think samantha is not nancy simply because she doesn't for me capture the true essence the true nancy
has a very big jump in it it is one of tim rice's best lyric i need to see vunbltd which is another side to the nancy character

while miranda krestovnikoff goes bird tagging in the wash mark horton sails down the river humber in a four thousand year old boat and me i get to investigate fish fingersin grimsby together we'll take you for a bracing trip along this windswept eastern seaboard this is the story of coast our journey takes us two hundred fifty miles from robin hood's bay down to king's lynn our starting point is a tight knit community on the yorkshire coast whose relative isolation made it a bit different from your usual fishing village this is robin hood's bay a cascade of cottages and narrow lanes carved into a cliff it's the prettiest kind of place to visit but don't let its innocent facade fool you for over one hundred years smuggling was the unofficial town trade from the early seventeen hundreds contraband regularly arrived here from all over europe because of its location robin hood's bay could have been custom designed for illegal imports it was one of the few safe havens on the east coast a broad bay protected by massive headlands and backed by inaccessible moorland and the cliffs made perfect lookouts for the smugglers from here they could signal to their accomplices out at sea and at the same time watch out for the revenue men smuggling was at its peak in the seventeen hundreds when the government slapped hefty import duties on luxury goods like silk tobacco and tea to pay for its almost constant wars with france local knowledge gave the smugglers access to a labyrinth of secret routes under cover of darkness they could creep up the beach with their booty and disappear into this tunnel they ventured into drainage tunnels like these at enormous risk smuggling carried the death sentence but the rewards were worth the risks bringing in just a pound of tea would have netted the smuggler the equivalent of a week's wages at one point eighty per cent of all the tea drunk in britain was imported illegally the smugglers turned this tunnel to their advantage i'm looking for holes in the ceiling above my head like this they could creep up here and you can imagine them stuffing rum and tobacco up through here into the house above it's very ingenious it wasn't just the men who struggled through tunnels like this that made money out of smuggling pretty much everybody in the village had their hands dirty the boatmen the storer even the local squire who lived here at thorpe hall he financed the smuggling and would have expected a good return on his investment here in the grounds of the squire's house is an underground chamber where he stashed his share of the booty look it's carefully lined in stone you can imagine it packed with gin tobacco brandy and silk by one thousand eight hundred fifteen at the end of the napoleonic wars soldiers were redeployed as excise men putting a stop to large scale smuggling but not entirely today customs and excise reckon nearly four billion worth of revenue is lost every year to illegal imports of tobacco and alcohol but there's never been a shortage of legal ways to make a living along this coast if you've got the ingenuity while the villagers of robin hood's bay were lining their pockets by smuggling the people here at ravenscar just three miles down the coast made themselves rich with a startling scientific discovery these are the remains of one of the u. k.'s very first chemical factories anthropologist alice roberts has come to see what's left
four hundred years ago the cloth and wool trade formed the backbone of the british economy none of it could have happened without an industry that grew up here i'm meeting archaeologist john buglass who knows the extraordinary role ravenscar played in saving britain's cloth industry i have to say john this looks rather disturbingly like a quarry i don't really understand how rock can have anything to do with cloth
it is a quarry it's an alum quarry the type of rock that's here is actually shale shale is a sedimentary rock which is laid down on the seabed yeah hidden inside the shale are crystals or salts of aluminium
right the aluminium salts can be used as a mordant in the dyeing industry what's a mordant basically it's a glue
it acts to stick the dye molecules in the cloth it stops the colours fading and it maintains the brightness
so what is the actual substance that they're after
what they're after is this material it's called alum right that's a crystal of pure naturally occurring alum
why don't they use natural alum then
natural alum doesn't occur in this country yeah they're having to bring it in from other places so they'd try to seek an alternative source in order to break the monopoly
four hundred years ago sites like this one at ravenscar were large industrial communities employing hundreds of people in the production of this precious substance
you'd have gangs of men working up against the quarry face pickaxes and shovels digging it out shovelling it into barrows then they'd burn it for three months why are they burning it that changes the chemical composition slightly they can then extract the salts it's very acidic so they have to burn alkali in there they had a special ingredient they used for that really
that special ingredient comes courtesy of the production team we're trying to make alum on this site for the first time in one hundred fifty years we'll try to recreate the process and hopefully discover why they needed to use stale human urine i've teamed up with open university chemist james bruce right james this is a natural alum crystal your challenge is to make us one of those this is a solution of aluminium sulphate isn't it yes equivalent to the liquor they got from the shale yes
we have to add the magic ingredient
yes come round this side
right how did they know urine would work
because urine was used for other processes it wasn't that unusual to be using urine in these sorts of processes it was a bottle on the shelf they would have said let's try this
yuck you chemists are a weird lot we simmered the disgusting solution for half an hour until something interesting happened it's working
that is the alum coming out now that cloudy stuff that white stuff is the alum
boil off the remaining liquid and what remains is alum
these are some of the crystals we're left with like snow yes they're not as big as the one you showed me before but size doesn't matter that would have been grown over a long period
it looks about done let's see what the result is this one is much brighter there's much more dye in this cloth than in this cloth
it becomes obvious why alum was so important to the cloth industry bright fast colours sold for much higher prices' we've made alum on a tiny scale but the original alum works was massive producing six hundred tonnes of the stuff every year in this cliff top chemical factory however it was ravenscar's proximity to the coast that was crucial to its success to make the alum tonnes of coal from newcastle and gallons of urine from the slums of hull and london arrived by sea clues on the beach show us how this happened
what they have off to the side are these rut ways used to bring the carts in with the material in barrels ready to be loaded straight into the boats
yeah
you can see quite a nice channel
yeah so these are to stop the carts slipping on the rocks
partly it's bad enough keeping your footing without a cart full of product you need to sell
the other one's over here yes they run off down the beach
the ruts are going to guide the wheels in the right direction
like a train track very much
this is the dock itself these rocks would be cleared out so the boats didn't damage themselves it's badly eroded now but it's all been cut away by hand the boat would sit to one side so it could be loaded large boats yes there'd be room for two even three
how did they get the alum down from the cliff top that comes down there
there's a diagonal line that runs all the way down the cliff yes they'd come down there onto the beach then up to the harbour
if you hadn't have pointed that out i wouldn't have noticed that that's the edge of a road you can see cobbles sticking out
you can see the line of the roadway the boats would be in the dock they'd load the stuff up the tide comes in they'd walk the boat back turn them round and off to sea to ship the alum wherever required possibly worldwide certainly across britain and northern europe a very valuable commodity
but the invention of synthetic dyes rang the death knell for alum factories after two hundred fifty years this ingenious industry created by people making the most of scant resources around them ended ravenscar finally closed in one thousand eight hundred sixty two
i remember coming on holiday to scarborough with my mum and dad innovations in holiday making you're after this is the place victorian engineers transformed a remote fishing port into one of europe's premier resorts scarborough has always prided itself on being able to stay on top of the tourism game it had this the world's first cliff tramway opened in one thousand eight hundred seventy four europe's biggest hotel the grand and in the nineteenth century the largest aquarium in the world and it had this the focal point of every visit to scarborough the spa opened in one thousand eight hundred fifty eight and its elegant sun court though that's not to say the sun always shines during its victorian heyday the spa's reputation grew as a place of entertainment and relaxation and was the most popular music venue outside of london simon kenworthy is the leader of the spa orchestra and something of an expert on the town's history when was scarborough's heyday
well the trains arrived in scarborough in one thousand eight hundred forty five from then on people started to come to scarborough in their masses by one thousand eight hundred sixty when this wonderful building was built the place would have been heaving with people people of a certain quality as well because people would have to pay to come in you'd have the aristocracy promenading about in front of the spa listening to the music scarborough was alive with people it was an incredible tourist resort people say that the bay here looks like the bay of naples a lot of the architecture is to do with the lie of the land in scarborough it's quite hilly so we've got these wonderful opportunities for terraces bridges we've got the castle on the hill
there is now it carries on this snobbery a lot of people who come to us come specifically to scarborough because it has this air of quiet gentility about it it does make them feel really good about themselves because they're in this fantastic atmosphere
i'm sold great i'm going to see out my twilight years here as well despite its snobbery scarborough's success as a seaside resort was actually based on an accidental discovery
the whole fortune of this town is based on this little bit of water coming out here people came to scarborough after the water was discovered in one thousand six hundred twenty by a local lady she discovered it had miraculous properties this is what's left that's it that's it
what's that it's just a little brown smeary mess it's the magic water of scarborough
it's not really safe to drink these days but you can have a go
do you think not
people were taking the waters into the nineteen fifties for its medicinal properties
instant dysentery i'd have thought
i wouldn't fancy it myself it looks fairly horrible
where there's muck there's brass the water simply contained magnesium sulphate as effective as alka seltzer is today did they make much use of the beach itself initially no
people just came for the waters but doctor wittie in about one thousand six hundred sixty wrote a treatise which went around the whole of the country in this treatise he extolled the virtues of sea bathing he said that a naked plunge into the salty waters followed by a sweat in a warm bed was a good cure for gout people thought we can take the waters and also plunge into the sea and we'll be cured
with a few aches and pains myself i think i'll go for a paddle oh oh it might look like the bay of naples but it doesn't feel like it oh in the early twentieth century scarborough was still anxious to bring in the high spending upper classes but with competition from newer brasher resorts it was time to rethink its image it had to think big scarborough turned to big game hunting for its next attraction africa had lions india had tigers scarborough had the tunny to you and me the tuna fish tunny fishing brought the gentry and the wealthy back to scarborough fisherman fred normandale was just a small boy when their yachts and rolls royces pulled into town lovely i had no idea there were tuna here i thought it was a tropical fish
the blue fin tuna lives in the atlantic as much as anywhere it goes all over europe
yes
it was quite an amazing way of life
look at the size of that that line up there
a real danger of getting pulled out i'd say that and they weren't catching them to eat
it was big game fishing just as you'd hunt marlin or swordfish it didn't last long the first were caught in the early thirties and the last was caught in fifty four they started to decline with the decline of herring a special few years it was exclusive people came from all over europe they came in their yachts they came in their private ships to go tunny fishing at scarborough
today blue fin tuna are close to extinction worldwide it's unlikely there'll be tunny fishing here again it may be a bit old fashioned and trying a little too hard to impress but i like scarborough what really comes across is the pride people have in their town and that's got to be a good thing
from scarborough our journey takes us past a sheltered bay which embraces the resort of filey and onto the most notorious headland on the yorkshire coast this is flamborough head a lethal spike of land jutting six miles out into the north sea in the seventeenth century one hundred seventy four ships were wrecked here in just thirty six years this part of the coast still sees plenty of shipping action fifty three miles further south we come to spurn head another remote spit of land located at the mouth of the river humber's busy shipping lane it's home to the country's only full time residential lifeboat station during big storms the road floods cutting off from the outside world the seven families who live here for them isolation's a way of life
last winter we was cut off for about two months um until the sea decided to behave itself and went back to normal when we know it's coming up to winter and the high tides we tend to do a really big shop i've got three freezers on the go and they're always full us wives on the station do everything because the men can't get off it no matter what to go out there in rough weather you have to be proud of him of all of them i wouldn't be normal if i didn't worry about him
with the beach on their doorstep it may look idyllic but this is part of the fastest eroding shoreline in europe in some places losing up to two metres every year before long the map of spurn head may have to be redrawn from here we follow the coast inland where mark horton is investigating our earliest seagoing traditions
this is the enormous hull docks from here ships bring their cargoes from all round the world this is where the ferries leave for continental europe the timber comes in from scandinavia the iron and steel from italy this is the river humber the gateway to britain but it's not just recently that the humber has been so busy people living around here have been using this river for trade and transport for thousands of years i've come to meet hull archaeologist ben gearey to find out why the humber estuary was our birthplace as a seafaring nation there are lots of harbour installations all the way round it's important nowadays was it important in the past as well
five bronze age boats were exposed by the shifting mud of the estuary near the small village of ferriby just outside hull in nineteen sixty three amateur archaeologists waded knee deep in the mud racing to dig out the most complete find before the incoming tide washed it away forty years after this boat was removed only now has the full significance of the find become apparent new radiocarbon dates reveal the ferriby boat to be four thousand years old the oldest seagoing boat ever found in europe before the boat disintegrated enough was learnt about its design for boat builders to make this half size replica what did the archaeologists actually dig out of the mud the three bottom planks
and also this part of the side here this is key to deciphering the technology used to build the boat we're seeing a transition from a dug out canoe technology to this sewn plank construction
where you have individual planks and because you don't have iron nails you sew them together
exactly yes
as we paddle our way towards ferriby i want to find out why of all the places along the banks of the humber so many ancient boats were found here
we think we have a bronze age boat yard we have evidence of boats being dismantled working on boats it's a boat yard they would have chosen this particular spot
we've the whole estuary why here
what you have to imagine is the environment being very different extensive salt marshes around the river wet woodland at the edges in those circumstances it's very important to find somewhere dry
this was the only dry land around yes as you're going up and down this estuary this is the ideal place to beach your boat to repair it
exactly
two of ben's colleagues have some other finds from nearby which suggest the ferriby boats weren't only sailing along rivers but also capable of crossing the north sea what's this one this is a very interesting example
this is a french axe this is trade exactly this has been brought over from the continent
the sort of axes that would have been traded in boats like the ferriby boat quite possibly isn't it extraordinary presumably it's that new maritime technology that enabled the bronze age to happen enabled societies to have metal it was the boat exactly the boat is central to development at this time in this area we think it seems ferriby was once an international bronze age trading centre this area would have been a hive of activity yes
communities connecting themselves to other communities by boat yes
to travel these long distances it's thought the ferriby boats had sails we've built a replica and actually shown it's possible to do this
that's the important step from a few bits of wood in the mud to a fantastic object like this that could have had an incredible impact on society i don't think you can overestimate the impact it would have had
the ferriby boats really are extraordinary they were being used at the same time stonehenge was being built proof of our earliest adventures as seafarers and traders with the outside world who would have thought in the bronze age that they would have built this bridge four thousand years later
it's an incredible mix of old and new
seagulls call
over fishing depleted stocks and now fish quotas have reduced that mighty fleet to only ten vessels but grimsby's still a major player in the fish business
ahoy there mates anyone partial to a birds eye fish finger
so take a tip from captain birds eye give 'em birds eye fish fingers
and grimsby is fish finger central processing nearly a million tons of fish a year although sadly none of it's caught locally any more most of it arrives in frozen blocks from as far away as alaska here at this processing plant three thousand fish fingers roll off the conveyor belt every minute at full throttle grimsby can splatter breadcrumb and flash fry ten million fish fingers weekly the outside is cooked so fast that the inside remains frozen from block to box takes only thirty five minutes today cod stocks are diminishing worldwide and so manufacturers are looking at new ideas and at more exotic fish for added continental panache young's have even brought in a french chef serge nollent what have we got here
so we've got the barramundi which comes from the indian ocean three days old that's sharp be careful this is very sharp
this one is a barracuda it's got big teeth hasn't it it's a very lively fish barracuda again from the indian ocean
will the british really warm to barracuda and chips
possibly
the challenge for serge and his team is to devise a dish that will sell as well as the trusty fish finger serge clearly has aspirations for haute cuisine but i can't help wondering if there's really a place for these in the supermarket is that fish wrapped around the asparagus it's filleted sea bass
some british asparagus and a little beurre blanc sauce which is a reduction of shallots white wine butter and cream
these dishes look delicious but one uses scallops the other uses asparagus and neither are mass produced factory fodder to the u. k. public they're specialised food have you created a dish which is economical and which can be mass produced in factory like this one
we have we're actually working on it at the moment with scallop
serge has come with wait for it that is the biggest fish finger i have ever seen serge an old recipe with a new twist what's inside here
inside we got some mushy pea which is a classic classic um accompaniment with fish and chips yeah
do you mind if i perform a small autopsy on it not at all so you've got a batter layer on top yep and that's the pollock there is it yes it is yeah then inside there's the mushy peas the mushy peas yep can i try a bit yes you can looks very hot yeah i prefer those to fish fingers yeah yeah the mushy peas gives some strong flavour it's got a tang in the middle what are you going to call this i don't know jumbo
jumbo mushy peas fingers jumbo mushy peas fingers
sorry serge jumbo mushy peas fingers is not going to work you need a good name
something we're working on you've got the product you need the name
leaving grimsby we follow the flat windswept coast southwards into lincolnshire grimsby's fish fingers and you never know maybe even serge's jumbo mushy peas fingers may end up being eaten here at one of lincolnshire's bracing seaside resorts cleethorpes mablethorpe ingoldmells together they boast if that's the right word the highest concentration of vans in europe with sixty five million visitors every year this coast's flair for ingenuity and innovation is nowhere more evident than here in skegness one day the fairground showman came upon an old turnip field by the sea and there he saw gold his name was billy butlin butlin was about to revolutionise the great british holiday by inventing the mega camp butlin's skegness the first camp billy built is still packing them in bold brash and brassy as ever neil oliver has joined the crowd
this is my first time at butlin's so i didn't know what it'd be like but i think i expected it to be winding down but look at this place it's jumping and it's going like a fair
come on feel the music it's party time come on
billy butlin opened this place in nineteen thirty six and it became the template for every holiday camp in the country even today just about when you can get a cheap holiday anywhere four million of us choose to come on holiday to somewhere like this every year the name butlin's has been synonymous with the british seaside holiday for seventy years but why did it all start here it was in skegness that butlin opened his first funfair in nineteen twenty seven he saw the opportunity to cater for the day trippers coming here in their masses from the industrial cities of nottingham doncaster and leicester i'm meeting professor victor middleton an expert on british tourism he knows all about the secrets to billy's success' what was it about billy that made him different
i think he was first and foremost a brilliant entrepreneur you know the dodgems story i don't he went to olympia in nineteen twenty seven saw an u. s. manufacturer demonstrate these cars and immediately went back invested every penny in a fleet of dodgems in skegness nineteen twenty eight was the first season and then he managed you saw how popular they were he got the sole agency for selling dodgems in u. k. and whole of europe
that is sheer genius absolutely so the money that he made from dodgems built everything else it was a key part of the whole empire an empire built on dodgems yeah they're still my favourite thing billy butlin's timing was perfect in nineteen thirty eight the holiday with pay act was passed
this year we've got holidays with pay look at that
whoo isn't that lovely
holidays with pay who says the world doesn't progress not every business pays this premium yet but a start has been made and what has long been an office privilege will become the rule in factories the holiday exodus has begun so a happy time to all of you
for the first time millions of ordinary workers had a week's paid holiday and wanted somewhere cheap to go in the summer butlin's masterstroke was to offer the masses an all inclusive seaside holiday for a week's wage and by providing all the facilities and entertainment on site the holiday makers would never need to leave the camp the original campers stayed in basic wooden chalets like these though the chalets were small the camp was on a scale not seen before accommodating over two thousand holiday makers so this is the original home from home then yes i think this is one of the last
of the original nineteen thirty six chalets of which there were hundreds in lines around the camp at that time
we'll have a look inside i'll have to say victor it's not saying luxury holiday to me
no i think to be fair it is looking a little bit sad at the present time listed building though it is but it's got everything people needed they had single beds basic furniture a mirror a single light bulb we have to remember the sort of conditions that people lived in at that time their houses the industrial smog very small houses overcrowded this would have seemed like a holiday heaven to people perhaps coming for their first ever holiday
and so you'd have a whole family in here yes but then they were used to doing that
in boarding houses you would have had rooms with five or six people in it's the way people took holidays at that time
yes
so what was the daily routine here for the campers
well right from the beginning breakfast would have been arranged in a fairly regimented way it was the mass catering then there would have been a series of activities all announced over a tannoy system
the remainder of your afternoon programme is exactly as printed so go out and enjoy yourselves and have a good time this is george saying bye bye
so if people wanted it virtually every hour would have been taken up with the holiday arrangements which were provided and that of course was completely unusual and a new part of the butlin plan
but the campers' fun came to an abrupt halt with the start of the second world war in nineteen thirty nine not one to miss a trick the ever resourceful butlin hired out the site to the military and butlin's skegness became a naval camp when the war ended the troops were replaced almost immediately by an army of holiday makers in even bigger numbers eager to let their hair down after wartime austerity as a result more and more holiday camps opened pontin's and warner's also capitalised on the trend butlin's was the market leader and seemed unstoppable by nineteen sixty six billy's empire had grown from one camp to nine and it's advertising pulled in even more visitors
here's your tea miss sales oh thank you
gosh isn't this exciting i do envy you your job yes i must admit i do love it and for holidays you can stop off anywhere you like in the world
well i could but i don't i always go to butlin's
instead of honolulu yes you see butlin's can never never be a letdown
you know for a start that you're certain to meet a gang of young people so you're bound to find friends and it's for sure you'll never get bored
stop the plane i'm getting off for butlin's not this trip perhaps but next time
a holiday experience is born
the regimented keep fit classes and pre planned sing alongs have all gone and the chalets have been replaced by apartments like this the reinvention seems to be working over a million visitors came to butlin's last year it's their seventieth anniversary next year but i wonder if it will all still be here in another seventy years
i think some of it will be much the same in the sense that the beaches will still be here give or take what global warming does the resorts will still be here because i see no reason why people will not want to spend leisure time in attractive environments and the type of accommodation will change the type of meals will change the type of entertainment will change and possibly another brilliant entrepreneur will come along with a totally different idea and will change the mould again
do you think they can change the weather
no that would be a very tall order i wouldn't guarantee that
butlin's is a survivor despite all the competition it's hung on changing with the times but perhaps what is says more than anything is that people will always want to be beside the seaside even if it is cold wet and windy
just four miles down the coast from skeggy we come to a very different kind of seaside from here on it becomes impossible to define where the land ends and where the sea begins it's a coast in a constant state of flux this is the salt marsh of the wash one of britain's last great wildernesses with half a million migrating birds passing through every year artists and conservationist sir peter scott was one of the first to recognise its importance in nineteen thirty three scott came to live at this lighthouse on the banks of the river nene where it enters the wash as a painter he was drawn to the beauty and the extraordinary variety of migrating birds and through his art he increased his understanding of the birds' behaviour but scott's interest in wildfowl wasn't just in painting them it was also in shooting them
i'd never really thought seriously about the conflict of emotion or interest in killing and in enjoying the birds alive it was a natural thing almost a noble thing to be trying to outwit them
the carnage of the second world war was to shift scott's perspective
before the war i'd been a tremendously keen wildfowler and after the war i was no less interested in the birds themselves but i was much less keen on destruction i think i'd had enough of that during the war and so i decided to give up the sporting part and simply concentrate on studying and painting and if possible helping to conserve these marvellous birds
one of the innovative conservation methods he introduced was the ringing programme using cannon nets to capture the birds and tag them eventually he went on to found the wildfowl and wetlands trust which protects and manages the u. k.'s precious wildlife habitats and it's still growing strong our zoologist miranda krestovnikoff has come to the marshes of the wash to see sir peter scott's legacy in action and to meet ornithologist sarah dawkins a member of the wash wader ringing group
the wash is this huge expanse of mud flats they're packed full of food that the birds can eat that's why in winter we've got something like four hundred thousand birds here they're eating the food that's in the mud flats
estuary mud is so full of food that it attracts huge flocks of wading birds when the tide comes in it pushes the birds off the mud flats creating one of the u. k.'s great wildlife spectacles but sarah hasn't come just to look at the birds her group comes here every month to catch and ring them and it's only at high tide when the birds are concentrated in one place at the top of the beach that they stand any chance of doing this the plan is to fire a cannon net adapted from the one invented by sir peter scott over the group of birds it's a tricky operation and hidden behind the sea wall we all wait anxiously for the net to be fired
fire
the group have worked together for so long that they operate like a well oiled machine and as soon as the nets are fired everyone sprints into action the nets have got to be lifted away from the approaching tide and then covered once they're in the dark they calm down they don't get too distressed
exactly now you can leave them here we can sort ourselves out we can get some cages think about and calm down it was dramatic wasn't it
one of the reasons for netting the birds is to see if they've been caught here before if not they give the birds an identifying ring oh my hands are so cold i can't squeeze what's the significance of the rings it's got a number and an address
it's unique to this bird anyone in the world who catches this bird can contact that address and find out this bird was ringed on the wash today
they're so easy to handle aren't they the ringing i've done in the past has been frantic because the birds are a bit skippy and not happy being handled but this is very easy waders are much calmer than other birds
which makes it easy for us to deal with them in this way
in order to minimise stress we release the oyster catchers as soon as we've ringed and measured them
we just literally pick them up and pop them out and then off they go
what the research of the wash wader ringing group has shown is that most of these birds are on huge migrations breeding in the summer in the high arctic and then travelling south some as far as africa in the winter
it's always nice releasing them and realising you've not damaged or affected them in any way
and for the birds to make these migrations our estuaries are vital the birds use them like service stations on a motorway if they can't stop off and refuel they're unable to complete their migration but rising sea levels threaten estuaries like this for the future of these birds we'll have to think long and hard about how to protect places like the wash
the quicksands and the quagmires of the wash's fickle landscape are also the stuff of legend this is the mud that eight hundred years ago swallowed the treasure of bad king john it's autumn one thousand two hundred sixteen and king john is in the final days of a bitter struggle against rebel barons he's lost london and is trying to mount a last strike against the rebel heartland in east anglia effectively homeless he's carrying everything with him including the crown jewels the king took the longer but safer inland route around the wash but sent his slow moving baggage train together with the jewels on the more dangerous direct route across the marshes navigation on the wash would have been extremely difficult there are no notable features and water in creeks like these rises quickly with the tide the story goes that they mistimed the crossing and got caught by the incoming tide chronicler ralf of coggeshall said many members of john's household were submerged in the sea and sucked into the quicksand the treasure went down with them but despite the efforts of hopeful treasure hunters down the centuries king john's crown jewels have never been found the mud flats that consumed the treasure stretched about four miles across the wash but all that has now become firm fertile land welcome to the fens over the last eight hundred years human intervention and invention have altered the line of the coast and completely changed the face of this landscape at the time of king john the fens stretched forty miles along this coast and twenty miles inland but not any longer maisie taylor a local archaeologist knows what brought about this dramatic change in the fens i can't begin to imagine what the fens must have looked like four hundred five hundred years ago what would they have looked like how big were they and how difficult was it to travel
they were absolutely vast which was wonderful for the people who lived here and exploited it but for outsiders it was an evil godforsaken place
what makes a fen so fertile to some extent it's the silts and sediments that wash in
but mostly it's like a compost heap just leaves and stems and soft parts of plants it has been said that the fens are just a giant grow bag
to turn this giant grow bag into fertile farmland seventeenth century engineers came up with this soft lines became sharp meandering curves became straight the marshlands were drained and tamed by the creation of artificial waterways
these rivers were put right through the middle of the fens to take all the water by the shortest route to the sea
so this is a man made landscape it's completely man made
and this goes right across the fens it's massive i know extraordinary isn't it
are you the news asian
yeah do you like do the lottery here or summing yeah you can buy your ticket here
yeah but i don't need to cos i've actually like won really yeah i got my ticket right here and it was a saturday one not a wednesday one cos the money's well nuffin' on a wednesday it's like only a million quid i've definitely won it and if coleen mcgovern says i'm lying then don't listen to her cos she's got one of them nut allergies cos one time we was all round the back of nando's and i gave her a peanut revel only i told her it was a coffee one and she ate it and she had to go to hospital and she nearly died and she well blamed me for it and i'm like it's not my fault you're so gay you can't even eat a peanut
you've made this yourself no but yeah but no but yeah but no but yeah but
twenty bensons please
and as for that
over at hill grange former mistress of prince philip bubbles devere is undergoing some acupuncture
i'll tell you gita i can't wait to see the back of both of them
just as well miss bubble because i just saw them leaving
what
dreadful place revolting
if we could have the luggage in the merc please
so you're leaving us early mr. devere
yeah i'm afraid so yes that bitch has ruined our honeymoon darling don't make a scene

andy it's lou
lou
i'm home
yeah i know
the monsoon has hit this town with avengance now the people here are suffering more than ever in conditions like this acute diarrhoea and pneumonia to become major killers a few days
the weakest are already fading an
elderly man is brought to
makeshift clinic gasping for breath two merlin doctors try to revive him but without success his grieving family watch him die what better proof of the urgent task now facing the international community as it begs burma's generals to open up today a british envoy in rangoon said he saw a hint of progress
we have to negotiate as broad ambitious an axe s. access as possible but recognise it is less than with we want and see what negotiations in the coming days by the asian leaders by the un secretary general achieves i think you will see quite dramatic steps by the burmese to open up
in the delta aid from britain gets through to the merlin doctors a child cries out as his infected wound is finally treated
this is a very common thing we see after emergencies that wounds are treated but they are not properly disinfected and sterilised when that happens it is almost certainty that the wound will break down and not heal properly
the day before yesterday he called my son's mobile phone and we got through but we could only hear breathing very weak breathing
denies but it has caused
political storm in britain the original arms deal signed in nineteen eighty five cemented britain's biggest ever export deal probe was launched a few years ago by britain's serious fraud office the allegation was prince bandar had received millions in kickbacks in two thousand six the saudis issued a threat that they might stop co operation on intelligence and future arms sales tony blair ordered an abrupt halt to the probe that is being challenged by the high court who ruled that the serious fraud office was wrong to halt the investigation across the atlantic r. t. parallel u. s. investigation is clearly reaching an active stage bae's chief
executive was issued with
subpoena court demand for information sign say critics that the u. s. will go where the british government fears to tread
it is national disgrace that in this country a major criminal investigation was stopped following political interference in order to protect commercial interests where as in the united states they prosecute d. the prosecutors are allowed to get on with their jobs
this is not the only route but because it is the only route which throws up moral problems add dumb stem cells don't umbilical chord use doesn't because it is the only route throwing up moral problems it seems to me the onus is on science to say look we can prove this works so far it hasn't
yes the votes cast by m. p.'s here over the next couple of days will have far reaching consequences the scientific research and for families right across the land many m. p.'s feel very passionately about the issue involved that is why gordon brown had to cave in and allow free votes on some of the more contentious elements some members of his own cabinet felt so strongly that they wouldn't have been able to support the government line gordon brown has launched a personal case for allowing research on hybrid embryos he is likely to get backing on that there is a lot of support building for a reduction in abortions down to twenty weeks
it has been a weekend to remember for portsmouth football club as the team celebrated yesterday's f. a. cup final victory against cardiff city aaron redmond and his side were cheered on harry redknapp were cheered on by an estimated two hundred thousand fans on an open topped bus portsmouth is used to celebrating naval heros but today was about victory of a different kind it felt like the entire city had turned out south sea common bluer than the sky but when you have waited sixty nine years you don't want to miss the party
we grew up wishing and dreaming for this day to happen
i drank myself silly last night and didn't have a headache this morning i feel brilliant for everybody and good old harry
harry they are
decker chariot along the seafront with so many loyal subjects in the way the bus had to stop
i have never seen anything like it it shows you what the cup means these people
have you ever been
the vital goal after winning the cup the team is expected to win free dom of this city it is not just the f. a. cup win they are celebrating it is what that win will give them the chance to play in europe next season for first time in this club's history nineteen years after his last screen outing indiana jones is back this time pitting his wits against soviet agents in the jungles peru the film was premiered at the cannes film festival at the world's foremost art house festival movie that has blockbuster written all over it has been the biggest talking point indiana jones is back in an aside there is an acknowledgement of how much time has past
this ain't going to be easy
not as easy as it used to be
harrison ford is sixty five years old many have questioned how credible an action hero he can be to a younger audience is it relevant as an issue
harrison ford although carefully revealed a little
i was pleased that we made the decision to move forward in time and to visit a later period in history which is the period of the cold war nineteen fifty seven and the era of mccarthyism in the united states a period of time in our history which i think is something we should be mindful of
breeze from the east brisk and
lots of beautiful girls he says as you'll see lots of beautiful girls
what sort of prices do you pay in this restaurant for a meal
it's all up to god
what's the secret
you have to be professional and work a lot
book
yeah well i'm reading this book it's a very famous russian book called anna karenina by tolstoy
ahh you know tolstoy great man tolstoy yeah he's a great man
that's his brother up here he's already drunk yes let him sleep he says yeah
my new companion is a labourer he comes from ukraine but his home town can't provide anything like the wages in moscow it may be tough in the capital but there are compensations'
alana alana i'm jonathan
hi hi these on first yes yes
that's very important that you have them of course
well presumably you have a lot of people treading through the house
yeah we have around one hundred fifty thousand visitors a year
in this little right there and that sofa's still there and even the photographs still the same
that's completely brilliant
and by the way the black couch on which he was born that was a family tradition that all the children were to be born on this couch
on the couch he insisted didn't he all his children were born on the couch
yes and some of his grandchildren even
this is his bedroom his bedroom yes how extraordinary
and here is tolstoy's famous blouse called tolstovka
oh yes can i touch it
well actually people are not supposed to but you can i think
i just love this place and i live here i'm one of the happiest men all over the world i think
you look like a happy man actually
yes i have four children two of them two boys they were born here at yasnaya polyana
does tolstoy does this place have a significance now for the present russia and the future of russia or would you like it to have
i hope that maybe yasnaya polyana would become some sort of symbol of new russia it's full of love to people and beautiful
you want the message to spread
yes it's my dream
of course of course it is because the more potatoes you can sell then you can buy things for your children people live on it
soft life or hard life is it
what do you think do you think it's an easy life it's hard
i thought you might say that i feel guilty i think i ought to help
send us a combine harvester that'll do it she says not having your bottom up in the air like that
it's true all you see is bottom try it all day try it for a whole day in many ways russia's peasants live much as they did a century ago once more theirs is a hand to mouth existence on the margins of the money economy stalin set out to destroy peasant agriculture and replace it with massive farms known as collectives food production on an industrial scale to nourish the workers who laboured in the factories to build the soviet union the plan produced a nightmare the peasants were forced to surrender their farms to the state there was no choice and no compensation those who dared refuse often the most go getting were branded as kulaks they were shot or sent to hard labour camps in siberia and all the food almost every grain of it was requisitioned for the factories as a result with the full knowledge of the kremlin millions of peasants died in the man made famine that followed eventually the collectives staggered into full production they were extremely inefficient and heavily subsidised but they yielded just enough food to feed the urban masses as well as the rural workers who harvested the crops on their behalf but when communism collapsed so did the collectives in some areas today moscow's nouveaux riche are buying up the land in others the collectives have been turned into co operatives but without any state support many of them are virtually bankrupt russia's peasants are poor but they're as stoical today as they were in the time of tolstoy their tenacity quite remarkable
lena lena
lena we met a woman who had worked on the collective all her life now retired she lives on her garden produce and her pension
have a look if you'd like to
i'd love to have a look please yeah go and have a look this is so pretty do you grow these for the pleasure for yourself of having flowers about you
she loves flowers yeah she does yeah it's not bad at all they pay our pension she's already done all her pickling and salting for the winter two whole kind of cellarfulls they buy large jars and she's already prepared her cabbage her tomatoes her cucumbers
at this point we were joined by another woman she's lena's younger sister zhenya
it's her sister it's your sister hello
she lives in the city and is far less tolerant of conditions in the village than lena
she says let our president know that this is the twenty first century and we're living like in the middle ages such a rich country and there is no gas in villages like this we've got no running water we have to get water from the well and have you seen our roads and it's an absolute outrage
i saw the disused well but i assumed that now there was running water but there isn't in fact this is her well is inside here now it's got its lid on which they dug themselves they wash outside basin toothbrushes and when you go like this the water goes through so it's a very simple little clever design to make sure you don't use more water than you really need rural russia in the twenty first century not far from the collective is a forest you can come here in search of mushrooms or to have a picnic i was after something else it's a rather chilling search somewhere in these woods there is a memorial or set of memorial stones and photographs of those who were killed here seventy years or so ago at the peak of the stalin terror when he was at his most paranoid and there's something really eerie about this beautiful still afternoon and we're searching for something that is rather dreadful and macabre do you speak english a little bit a little bit do you know where the memorial is
we don't know we know that some memorial stones was um transported
yes from one place to another in soviet times it was impossible to mourn the victims of the terror today they're merely an embarrassment to the state we're looking for the memorial down here
yes straight down here
she says you need to speak russian
i do need to speak russian and what does it do for you what does it what do you i've only just got in so i don't know but what do you get from it
she is saying that she finds that her knees ache less she has less pains in her back her neck it all just makes her feel a lot better so her whole life she worked in norilsk which is behind the arctic circle she is a welder and she welded some of these huge
ah yeah yeah yeah
she says i have got hands like a man all muscley
it must be rather better here than in the arctic
they say in norilsk they say we have winter for twelve months and the rest is summer
so long so long
he enjoys automatic respect as i discovered the history of this village i began to realise why atrocities like beslan can still happen i found some old men who told me what happened to them here in the second world war the episode is indelibly etched in their memory in the freezing winter of nineteen forty four russian soldiers entered the village and rounded up every man woman and child they were herded into cattle trucks and shipped off to soviet central asia at gunpoint yeah every chechen the whole nation was deported they had no food no water no heating one in every five of them died on the way
when someone died there was no equipment nothing to dig the grave and they found anywhere if they found wall then they'd take out some stones put the dead body there and then cover it by stones
stalin apparently thought the chechens were collaborating with the nazis for this alleged betrayal these old men who were then children were raised in exile they dreamed of home three years after stalin's death they were reprieved and they returned but they've never forgotten or forgiven we can be sure nor will their children or grandchildren not far from the chechen village we entered the flood plains that border the river terek in the nineteenth century the terek formed a natural frontier against the expanding russian empire whose armies were driving south determined to conquer the caucasus once and for all at that time the russian front was spearheaded by a phalanx of shock troops who were as famed as they were feared the cossacks today i'm going fishing with some of their descendants in some parts of the country the cossacks are a resurgent force xenophobic thugs who like giving russia's minorities a rough time but here in daghestan the terek cossacks are themselves a minority and they behave accordingly placido domingo of our time
then placido domingo can't compete with him
it was on this front that tolstoy fought alongside the cossacks and he came to admire them not because they hated their enemies in the mountains beyond the river but for their courage in battle against them you've got your gun petr but when he really liked was another side of the cossack character their simple life their love of the outdoors and their glorious independence of spirit what have you got there it's huge can we take it out and look can we take it out and look sorry to say even cossacks can be poachers the principle ingredients for ukha russia's famous fish soup had being caught illegally with nets' very alive i soon discovered that our chef for the day is not given to hiding his feelings nor is political correctness his strong suit
nikolai nikolai
you enjoy doing this yes and you're a proud cossack yes what is it to be a cossack what makes a cossack different
it means to be able to like run your cars your
my cossack translator is getting lost for words' do you have a big faith in russia in mother russia
tell me what you think is the true russia
in a single phrase like russia is the russian people
spasiba
very very much
yeah this is the biggest market in daghestan amazing
walking through this open air shopping mall i began to appreciate shamil's astonishing achievement in uniting the tribes of the caucasus they must speak at least a dozen languages in this market alone there are thirty four clans in daghestan and even now blood feuds and vendettas between them not to mention kidnappings tend to scare visitors away when we were planning on coming here there's a thing called a foreign office advisory and we were told it's not safe to go to daghestan because of robbery kidnapping and even worse
well right now you are in the most dangerous place in daghestan you can be kidnapped by the traders by these ladies well and they business what they are doing is the most dangerous business
but khan has no illusions he knows very well there are islamist insurgents hiding in the mountains and he also knows that in this muslim society they will always find some support he knows they're here and he wants them out what is your attitude towards these people cos they still exist underground don't they
yes they still exist but the tragic thing is that um they do not represent not only any daghestani village they do not represent any daghestani hamlet these people are out of daghestan society
you're a father you've got a family do you fear them
i'm afraid of them my perception is that we should treat them as ordinary criminals not as a part of daghestan society
in the distance below the mountains to the east is the caspian sea on its shores the most southerly and the oldest city in russia derbent derbent was first settled at least five thousand years ago the great fortress which overlooks the harbour was built by the persians a mere fifteen centuries ago to protect the city from invasion from the north but its strategic location made it a magnet for the czars here we are in the oldest city in russia that's right and somehow it hasn't been ruined how's that
in five hundred sixty one they built all these fortifications and these walls up to the mountains goes approximately seventy miles it is compared with the great chinese wall with hadrian wall and there are three fortifications and this is one of them
but derbent was above all a city of traders and it survived because the merchants were ready to cut a deal with almost anyone to keep the peace
what they did was they ceremonially gave the key of city and the historical manuscript called the history of derbent and they said that you are winners this city belongs to you and when peter i came to derbent
it tells that in some way they came to philosophy that there is no reason to fight against anyone the reason is to keep peaceful life and if someone want to rule us let him do it but why war and this is a very you know it is very different story with this city comparing with the story of daghestan absolutely
it was built in the early eighth century it's in persian on right side and on left side it is in arabic means just enter this mosque with the belief
this is something very unusual
praying together praying together it is a very peaceful city khan is not only a clan leader but a university professor and a connoisseur of daghestani rugs'
most of them local and you see that this is a soviet period prayer rug which is
they still make them in the soviet period
yeah but this is it was banned religion was banned in the soviet period here wasn't it anyway i think that this rug is something like nineteen forties or nineteen fifties and here we have natural dyes by the way natural dyes and mixed with chemical dyes this is chemical this is natural as you make a difference between plastic flowers and natural flowers you can see it straight away can you if you are expert
hello
hello come and sit down cynthia nixon ladies and gentlemen
hello
and let's take a peep it's my favourite comedian david mitchell hello sir take a seat very good it's good isn't it worth putting your jacket on for now now the sex and the city premiere on monday night yes you i saw the interviews all of you seemed genuinely overwhelmed by it
we were shocked there were literally thousands of people there we weren't expecting it i don't know i hadn't thought about that part i had thought about the audience full of people watching the film seeing them react and the party but i had not figured the sidewalks would be lined with people
it is leicester square it's big there they are going crazy the people were you there david i wasn't invited
i don't get invited to all the big celebrity things no no no no
you must have gone to the premiere of your own film
ah that was they decided on that one that if we did a premiere you know how you were surprised by the thousands of people in leicester square they felt if they'd done if for our film we would have been surprised by fewer people in leicester square than normal
now on the night obviously there was a lot of focus on what you were wearing
yes there often is
here you all are you kind of won the old fashion thing didn't you no cos everyone was like yeah you looked the best that's very nice you looked fantastic thank you ooh hello

is that someone colouring in the rest of your dress
what is that no that's an autograph pen
no one has ever asked me how i feel or said i look beautiful i don't like my few experiences of being on red carpets has been going to awards dos and i find they're one of the most unpleasant environments i've ever been in cos everyone firstly you are terrified that no one will know who you are you will be stopped by security and turned away that has not happened fortunately but you stand in front of hundreds of photographers all taking identical photographs and screaming at you screaming david david left david right left up down david you're terrified that someone more famous is coming up behind you and they will flatten you you think why don't you just it only takes one of you i could send a photograph i'll put on my dickie bow go out in the garden and set the timer you can have that snap for free and you can all fuck off
you must feel a bit like that
a little bit a little bit
how are so many living the number of photographers they all presumably put food on the table how they're getting identical shots of the same people one shot of me from this direction and then there's a guy who's got it from there and from there they all there's the picture editor of the daily express going i dunno i prefer it from four degrees to the right it's insane
now the plot of the film is a closely guarded secret
yes which makes me think what the hell happens
is there something really shocking in it
it turns out everyone's ghosts that's quite a good one all along everyone was ghosts
not just the women but all of new york it's not there any more
it's a massive twilight zone spin off no one exists
i know what i forgot to ask you why was the it's not the world premiere is it in london
is it something where people go these are the questions you'll be asked if anyone asks why it's in london we're building momentum
when i said why are we going to london first they said we wanted the new york premiere to happen very close to the film opening and the new york premiere would be huge and all the actors would be there whereas just the four women have come to europe
we open movies on fridays
really do you not do that that sounds weird to me really at the weekend who goes out at the weekend oh cynthia no they do usually open on a friday
right so i don't know they are trying to grab the matinee crowd
why open midweek i don't know
they're trying to build momentum they build it from wednesday and then you have some momentum on thursday and so by friday it explodes you've got the idea yes people are getting stupider and stupider so you have to give them more and more notice when anything is going to happen at all that's why you have to keep the plot a secret because if you told people the plot they think they have seen the film
or they might just forget by the time it opens exactly
i like this scene cos it's a real proper
coffee shop yes here you are how often do you guys have sex
sex miranda please what
she's three she doesn't know what it means i am forty one i still don't know what it means
i know but she's repeating everything
if i'd known girl talk was on lockdown i wouldn't have flown three thousand miles we can talk
let's just not use that word
fine how often do you guys
colour thank you well
i can't colour enough i'd colour all day every day if i had my way i would use every crayon in my box
that is the sound of momentum building
we are air lifting in clips as the time get closer
suddenly we can put them all together it's the film right now sex and the city right has introduced all of these terms into the language so you say you're not familiar with sex and the city
i must admit not
i wonder if any of these terms from sex and the city have reached your world
your odd sex and the city less world right do you know what a trysexual is
is that men women and animals
sort of it's someone who will try everything once
what's a darwinian
no i don't know you see i'm nervous to speculate
do you know cynthia
it is something about why men are reluctant to marry and we are weeding them out from the population
so good it's a man who's over thirty and single because he's been weeded out from propagating the species
that's that's me all right that's good so i am essentially the dodo so you know look at me while i'm still here one day i'll be in picture books
um some champagne slash nerve gas cross breed
nerve clicquot would be the chutzpah you have after you drink champagne
yes if you're too nervous to cross the room to talk to a guy you have some nerve clicquot and over you go you see yes i do yes and then you're drunk and a bit of a slag very good in the film is it your real hair obviously it's your hair but is it your actual colour
it is my actual colour
did you go red specifically for
yes for sex and the city
did it affect your life cos you had to have red hair a lot
no i don't think it affected my life i don't think hair colour no it didn't except that when i have my red hair people are far more likely to recognise me so when i can get away from it it's a good thing
looking at how different people look there's a website that the university of saint andrew have developed it's a face changing website you put a picture of yourself in and you see how you would look as a chinese person or as afro caribbean or old or young or shall we do david first or cynthia first let's do david first there's david that's you normal would you agree
i'm it's not my place to say
yes i think that looks like you now here's the thing so here you are as a baby that's quite frightening
quite a toothy baby
yes you do look like you ate your way out of the womb
you'd be surprised to see a baby come out with that much of a defined hair do
you look like an oompa loompa there i have to say
this is interesting we can feminise your face
oh right
now you look like the phantom of the opera
this is all very instructive cos i was thinking of an op maybe i'll hold off for a while
this is my favourite this is where they make you into a caveman this is you as a caveman oh dear you look slightly like prince andrew there now cynthia there you are as your lovely self yes shall we see you as a baby your baby was weird
that's not a baby that's a kewpie doll
it's slightly bride of chucky
with the scary earrings
it's my favourite so we'll look at you as a cavewoman wa hee the lipstick seems a little token there
and the earrings
some people say that he's stupid that's what all this is about yes
that's why there's so much preparation going into the wedding they're building momentum that's what's happening talking of weddings is it a rumour or is it true you're getting married
we can't get married you can get blessed or something here you can
we can get married for pretend d'you know i mean we live in new york new york has no same sex marriage one day soon hopefully it may and then i think we'd consider it
is there one place left still doing it
what do you mean still doing it it used to be everywhere in the seventeenth century gay marriage in america was fine
you'll soon have a nice big election yes and that should be good change well we'll knock on wood i don't know how it's going to go
we're obsessed as everyone in america is with the election and with who the democratic nominee is going to be we talk about it all the time my son who is five and a half is trying to keep up he sees everybody is interested we had a time magazine come to our house the other day with a picture of barack obama that said the winner because he's getting closer and closer and my son picked it up and said look hillary clinton he can't figure out which is which
it is a surprise in the plot rips off a mask aha it was me all along reading about you i didn't realise you were a child star
a child actor perhaps might be a better
you were on a list on v. h. one of child stars
and you worked with sarah jessica parker before
did your schooling suffer were you not very academic because you were pursuing all of that
no i was one of the things that saved me from the curse of the child actor syndrome was i went to a really a very competitive junior high and high school and in fact when i was in junior high school i was in the film of amadeus which shot in czechoslovakia and i said i wanted to do the film so much milos foreman directed it i was a huge fan of it on stage and i said i could only do this if you promise that i don't shoot for more than two consecutive days you'll fly me home so i made i don't even know how many trips back and forth to czechoslovakia to make sure i didn't miss school i was flown out one time for a forty five minute rehearsal and flown back
wow yeah similar to your childhood david
i think i got on a plane about five times before i reached the age of majority yes
the similarity is that you were a bit of a brain box as a child
er i was a swot yes i was good at lessons i suppose yes
were you in some sort of gifted child thing
no
i thought you were so clever you got moved to be with clever people
that was me
i wasn't in sex and the city
but when you were young i'm gonna get there in the end dammit is this a new format yes who is this fact true of i just read out random biography things some of them will be true
i was very tempted to go for the whole gifted child separated out for a special bunker by the mod focuses brain power on moscow everyone may die
in school were you any good at sport no
were you sporty no but didn't you do fencing
oh i did i was i did have a gym requirement in college and i did take a semester of fencing sort of disastrously
why disastrously have you ever tried it yes i have you have yes
did you enjoy it no it's horrible
it's sore it's your thighs
there's a lot of that isn't there
i don't even know that i got as far as the moving just the staying in place and trying to do this
i was at drama school we probably didn't have a proper teacher we just liked the hats that was it we liked wearing the hats and waving around but listen you like fencing you'll love this story it's also good news for our elderly viewers i say our elderly viewers residents at the catholic old people's home of corpus christi in melbourne fed up with bowls dominoes and bingo have taken up fencing now
that doesn't look safe
fighting for biscuits by the way this isn't a picture this is live footage they've just nodded off oh you wouldn't watch it though extreme elderly fencing now look at this bout ah yes very good see how the man there is cleverly distracting his opponent by pointing out the time yes hurry up it's a quarter to death they know all the terminology en guard thrust parry knit one purl one here's another fight now um
i think she's fishing i don't think that's fencing
she's either fishing or trying to improve the reception on her television one or the other it sort of it is it's pensioners' fight club as they say there are only two rules to pensioners' fight club one no one talks about pensioners' fight club and two hang on what was it again doris what are we in a club er no it can actually be quite violent look at this one ow another two feet lower and that would have gone straight through her tit i love that it seems the most unlikely thing to ask elderly people to do in the world
they're obviously there's a lot of pressure on places in the old people's home hoping they'll finish each other off
in terms of childhood ambitions you didn't want to be an actress what did you want to be
well i wanted to be a number of things throughout my childhood but the youngest when i was about four i wanted to be a policewoman
really and you've never seriously pursued that
no once i had left say four or five that didn't seem so appealing any more
that's depressing isn't it at the age of four or five no now you did have lofty ambitions
yes didn't you want to be prime minister i did yes
you still could be i don't want to be prime minister any more
it doesn't seem like such a good job i think when i was a teenager i was a megalomaniac i thought who better to be in charge of everyone than me
did you run for school office and things like that no
teachers were appointed you couldn't be voted in i never flattered myself as popular but i thought you know look at the nerdy people who get to be prime minster they're not the popular people at school at all are they no so i thought a bookish swot like me may one day be given ultimate power but i went off the idea at university when you meet other students who want to be politicians and thought they were all arseholes so i thought maybe i would become a complete arsehole if i tried to do that
so don't no don't worry i won't try and rule us all thank god i promise the only good thing about being in political office the big book news is that cherie blair has published her memoirs are you familiar with cherie
he used to be prime minister she is not just the permanent prime minister's wife
she's married to whoever is prime minister the great thing about the job is you get this terrific wife she will tell everything everything about you and she believes in the mystics and has a terribly wide mouth she's otherwise a terrific wife cherie brown
why bring contraception just leave the lights on or or doing the proper catholic thing tony could have pulled out at the last minute or maybe he was worried if he pulled out early gordon brown would take over and mess it up i just wanted to talk about you were all living the world of glamour of sex and the city new york david doesn't it's bizarre maybe on paper it sounds worse than it is but is it true you still live in an ex council flat
um yes yeah yeah
you must be making quite a lot of money and gordon has made the houses nice and cheap
the thing is i live in a flat i bought seven years ago that is fine but it's much more unpleasant than when i moved in cos i've been living there but the last time i moved was i think the most stressful day of my life ever and the prospect of moving again is terrifying now houses are getting cheaper i've got another excuse not to move and i hate the fact that i have to take pride in where i live it's on the t. v. the whole time i couldn't stand this living room i have to change that why all you need is a roof heating a t. v. and a fridge and you're sorted
what sort of shithole do you live in
it's not that bad it's perfectly functional is there sawdust on the floor no there's carpet on the floor it's fine but the thing is everyone's got to give such a massive shit about their domicile why it's a nice thing to surround yourself it's nice if that's your hobby fine but why is there so much pressure on me to be bothered to move and paint the place and worry about that bit over the cooker that's melted you see there are a lot of other slovenly people out there and when we get round to it we will speak
are you gonna go in the celebrity version of how clean is your house are kim and aggie gonna come round and go oh my god
he wouldn't let them in why would i permit that why does anyone permit that
why does anyone apart from that they do clean your house for free
i've never felt my house is so dirty that i wouldn't mind public humiliation to get it cleaned do it yourself or pay someone not no i want it for free and i don't mind the whole country thinking i'm a slob
now listen peep show goes with the seinfeld thing there's no hugging no learning is there
not really no certainly any hugging isn't really meant
but what i love about it is it's a very specific look the way peep show's filmed cos it's all done from point of view and how do you do that it is very high tech
we used to do a lot of it genuinely with cameras mounted on our heads and we'd sort of wear a bicycle helmet with a mini camera on the front
like a miner yes like a sort of yes yes like a miner
we've used that less and less cos the footage you get from a mini camera strapped to an actor's head is not that usable all the time so in general we just use a normal camera there's a lot of reaching around it and pretending to lift a cup of tea up to the lens it's quite odd when you're character's eating something you have to bring a fork under the lens use your hand to remove the food and then take the fork away so it looks like it's been eaten it's kind of gross yes you end up getting a bit of sausage in your hand thinking people think this is a good job
as a way of looking at things you think they can't keep that up but actually we've got used to it now it's
it's quite a logical way to film things until you try and do it when you spend everyday wishing can we not just film it normally this time round but yeah
i asked the boffins here at the studios how you filmed it and they built me this thing and apparently this is close to what you guys use ugh this is how you film the series
right it is quite tricky i tried this earlier it's
it's quite heavy is it something like this
not very
no that would give the point of view of a person a foot and a half taller than you
looking over everyone else's heads that would be quite dull footage when we did it with a helmet we had a very small camera that would be mounted at eye level and a little cycle helmet rather than that period motorcycle helmet
i feel like james bond what does it look like there you all are look at that there's my guests do you like my guests
hello hello hello there you are
and that is what peep show looks like if i sit beside you shove down shove down this is what peep show looks like if you're talking
hello i'm so depressed about my life et cetera et cetera
and if i turn to you this is what peep show looks like it is yeah oh look in peep show if your character was on a date it would look like this hello yeah and then cut to
and then sip of wine
oh yes please lovely
glug glug glug lovely
i have to say it's really heavy my neck is now concertina'ed into itself excuse me ugh oh that is so heavy feel the weight of that
oof
that was on my head that's
who's idea was it oh i draped but i didn't stain sometimes that might be dirty and i would've left a mark that would be bad so um all right now talking of sex and the city i thought what we could do i thought we could recreate a scene from sex and the city
a a nude scene or
i thought we wouldn't go nude unless you feel it's important to your character it would build a lot of momentum i'm telling you now and then she took her dress off obviously you can be miranda and david and i can divvy up charlotte and carrie who can we get to play samantha the vivacious blonde we have secured one of our finest comic actresses ladies and gentlemen she was nana in the royle family liz smith there she is hello liz now liz is that your sex and the city hat
it it's the in thing it's the in thing this season you know it's to wear rhubarb
is that real rhubarb on your head it's real rhubarb growing out of my head
i want you to be well aware that you can't go anywhere this season without rhubarb i hope that's what you'll do wherever you go graham wear your rhubarb darling wear your rhubarb rhubarb rhubarb rhubarb
what did everyone do last night
nothing
nothing of note
i don't want to talk about it
why what happened did you sleep with someone on your second date
no it was the third date and it was alexander lumley the investment banker that i met at the young art collector show
no no it was good except i don't think i can say it
oh get over yourself

i came back to go to school i mean at the universities over there you can major in soup
so you decided to come and seek me
no i got back i saw you and before you can say brit girls are easy there you were
there i was david you're supposed to say something like you love the colour of my hair or you like the way the sunlight catches my dazzling smile
why would i say that that just sounds a bit poofy
because david i'm beautiful
yes i know it's obvious you're beautiful that's why i asked you out
and i accepted going out with you as a viable option because i could see the potential for change
you can't just change human beings
well if you can't change them what's the point in collecting them
you collect people of course
only yesterday the postman became an ally he used to ignore me but i answered the door in my mr. men nightie and pow he's changed overnight where are you going i'm going home are you going home to change your t. shirt

i think you look lovely
will someone get me out of here fine all right where's the keys jonny yes gaz the keys would be in my very small very warm pants
you're his brother
no that makes it ten times worse at least you could say you were experimenting
i experiment with compasses beasts and sugary snacks not with other men's parts
we'll toss for it wow i've got the biggest widgy in our family go munch
i've never really thought seriously about suicide before
phew jonny you're still here then i'll just be going out for a bit
it'll be easier next time
david aargh david aargh aargh david david where are you going i just said i'm going home that's not how you play the game
i don't play games louise
you've got to ah i know what you're doing
yes i'm going home
i just want to get to know you i don't like games
fine i'll play because i do actually really like you so what music do you like
you're a cheeky cheeky boy
that was weird d'you have any pets
ah you'd just love to know that wouldn't you
well yes that is the point of asking a question ow why would you punch me
you're so silly
ow i'm not that hurt can you not see this is wrong you can't go round hitting people
david i can where are you going
home i'll see you around
you can't leave me you've got to walk me home it's a dangerous world for a girl like me
it bloody isn't
mum yes picklewig d'you remember when you and dad first got together vaguely
he goosed me in the queue for the bar at the traveller's rest we ended the night across the bonnet of a fiat panda
did dad ever ask you to do anything you were uncomfortable with
of course he did but don't worry it'll shrink back up in a hot bath
i'm worried about gaz
is that why you crept in so late last night i thought you were a burglar
so why did you confront me naked force of habit we haven't had sex for a few days not since i moved in why not
are you sickening for something no just been too busy but i wanted to last night
except i came home and he was with another woman
i knew this would happen no he was on the bed well that's good for a start
and where are you going i'm not seeing whipped cream go to waste come back here janet
louise i'm really busy i'm poeterising
yeah anyway janet you know david yes what about him he's mature and not in a cheese way
no can you think of any turtle icons other than touche love his work
no david's horrible he won't be manipulated he won't let me change him he's too mature he's like old playdough only i wouldn't eat david
well dump him then oh inspiration touche away but were you secretly gay
but i can't dump him i love him
listen david's nice he's just a bloke and you'll find most blokes don't like playing games a turtle is hard on the outside but chewy in the middle like a big bogey
but i punched him and everything
and they don't like being punched especially by little incy women
no janet punching's flirting
oh then cheryl gascoigne should be bloody grateful
but i had it all figured out i thought punching's what you did
grow up louise can't you see i'm busy i can't grow up
just try talking to david like you talk to me about your life your plans ask about his
and then punch him
no just try and be a grown up
well that's difficult
relationships are you won't keep him if you act immature
i'll lose him like i lost that donkey
yes you have to be grown up now give me a line to follow a turtle's head is great because
he gave me the fright of my life all p. v. c. and whipped cream he looked like a masochistic trifle
if it makes him happy maybe you should give it a go and if you don't like it you say brian you're giving me a chilblain or some other codeword
what do you mean codeword
you really don't know how to live do you if you want to tie someone up or be spanked but don't like it you use a special word to make them stop
no a word not connected with sex
what's a kangaroo got to do with sex don't ask i still can't look your uncle joey in the eye
it's no good gaz i can't look at you
for god's sake i'm over it just think of it as another stepping stone to becoming a real man yes
i do believe it's in that kipling poem if if you can pick some cream soap bondage keys from your p. v. c. clad friend's pubic hair then you'll be a man my son
it wasn't that bad at least i'd shaved down there
oh i've touched your shaven john craven it makes me guts lurch
let's talk about ladies' boobies that'll cheer you up no come on no ladies' bobblies
bosoms isn't bosom such a bad word it's so unlike the thing it describes
what would you call a bosom you know in an ideal world cos tits don't really say it either tits tits tits sounds sharp
yeah and breasts it sounds slippy you know breasts
yeah i'd call 'em er
lubberdubs lubberdub dub
i'd call 'em er gaz pots
yeah yeah look i shouldn't be sitting here thinking about lubberdubs i've got to see my future in laws i've got to concentrate what if they get angry and throw me out
who could get angry with that little face i'm serious gaz these people really hate me
at christmas they have this santa and when i walk past it it shouts abuse at me what does it shout it goes like ho ho ho all gangsta rapper like
you're just being stupid
i'm not i don't know what i can do
oh jonny jonny jonny my huckleberry friend
what does that mean you know when you won the toss to get my keys i lost the toss lost gaz
whatever you just did it you know grabbed the bull by his horn so to speak so what that's like doing anything unpleasant like cleaning the toilet
you might not want to but you just have to grab janet's toothbrush and scrub with all your heart
do that with janet's mum and dad get it over with like when i copped off with bald shirley for a bet just ploughed in and thought of duncan goodhew
you're right the sooner i do it the sooner it'll be done nice one right that's it then i'm going to seal my future i'm going to take on the parents and win my woman i'll crush their icy hearts with this look
it works for me
i'll say to him i'm marrying your daughter and not you or any stinking thing will stop me please sir if that don't work just stick your hand down their drawers you've got a lovely touch
i wish jonny'd come back he's probably still out celebrating oh well it gives me chance to think of an end line for this poem
no i suspect they'll be discussing my dowry over primrose wine lardy cakes and a game of backgammon
you should try it just once a bit of tiesy uppy whippy chainy stuff
calling it baby names doesn't make it sound any less dirty
i think you should give it a go i had to wear a tool belt for jonny's pleasure for a while
maybe you're right maybe he did it to surprise me if that's his thing i'll try it once if i hate it i'll just tell him i'll use a codeword kangaroo
well i did wear a bin bag once just to see if i looked good in it that was actually quite fun what was in the bin bag just me oh and some chicken skin that was the best bit
donna you're obviously twice the perv that gaz is you could probably teach him a thing or two just say if you feel uncomfortable or he wants to use gravel was jonny o. k. when you chucked the tool belt he cried to be honest it set off this adult baby thing don't like that either especially nappy changing time ooh
to jonny the turtle by janet smith poeteress jonny you're like my turtle and being married to you will be turtle tastic you have a hard shell and are often scaly but the best thing is how long turtles last it's ages like and that's just what our marriage will be long and very happy like a turtle
and it was all a dream oh yes of course
phwoar come on you can do anything like a panda

hiya
hiya you seem happy did you speak to your mum and dad no
i have no parents you do i saw them yesterday i don't think about them any more so they don't exist
but not thinking about something doesn't mean it doesn't exist like i'm not thinking about lorraine kelly but i know hold on now i am thinking about her all right i'm not thinking about cement mix but i know hold on now i am thinking about it i'm not thinking about the versailles treaty but i know it exists but now you are no cos i don't know what it is
i need you to fill out these wedding invites
these are christening invitations but you wanted tissue invites are we getting baptised instead i always wanted a biscuit at church
why
to see what christ tastes like
he tastes like rice paper jonny
imagine that i'd have thought the son of god would have headed in the ginger direction
did the council call no why i applied for a quickie wedding and i've asked for cancellations let's hope someone's fiance dies soon
i'm crossing my fingers on that
can you go out tonight louise and donna are round for a dress fitting aren't you rushing things no but you're all wound up like a cat on stilts i'm coping can't you see i can't have a dream wedding or my dad give me away watch me cope i'm good
you're in shock we can get married when your parents will support us
jonny i have no parents i'm an orphan it's rather a shame but i'm terribly chipper
you're trying to spite them they may not like me but they love you
how many times must i say it you are marrying me and it'll be friggin' marvellous
i think the way i proposed was better yours was just rude
when did you sleep with her was it a full moon
it was a year ago it was only one night and she was rubbish honest
i don't care if she was good was she really really bad
i'm sorry if i'd known we'd get together i'd never have done it
david you don't understand what how many women have you slept with
fifty three but about a third of them were real minge bags so don't worry
oh oh god oh god
that's what they said
don't you get it why how many men have you slept with don't worry if it's less it is less isn't it course it's less only dean gaffney has slept with more people than you
under ten or you should get a smear test there could be all sorts living up there
but donna though ugh i thought you were different i told you i'm not like that any more oh god you're celibate you did it too much and ran out of steam like a big freudian sex train
no it's not that i was young and naive and young naive men do sleep around they don't mean to they do it by accident it's a curse
so you're saying that donna seduced you
what
she held you against your will and it's not your fault oh you poor innocent thing i'm not saying that at all poor baby i'm here for you david d'you need some milk of magnesia
no look donna didn't seduce me it was a two way thing honestly
she seduced you then brainwashed you she's a strange and evil force and i think she dyes her hair you'll know david do the accessories match the outfit i like it when you shop with me i can buy heavy stuff like vodka
why are there so many different types of shampoo and why do you stare at them for ten minutes
but you can learn so much how to sniff a melon or a peach
i know exactly how no gaz
you only came to avoid munch didn't you can you blame me he's everywhere he's like god aw thanks gaz jesus don't flatter me look what i robbed
put 'em away we'll get in trouble they can't do you once it's robbed it's called double geoffrey no i'm going to the pub hey can i come

no no don't invite munch why not he seems like a nice bloke he isn't he truly isn't he's like a leech just there all the time he uses me shower takes up donna's time eats dripping over me porn everyone in rubber sluts has got really greasy skin now
what's the problem tell him to go i can't he's got no friends aw that's so sad and that's his power if he's lonely why doesn't he join a club or something
won't have him he puts everything he touches in his mouth he's not welcome in public toilets any more
gaz
what
you know i've just thought i haven't got a best man yet
i've been longing for this moment with all me heart ever since i was a boy me dream was
stop it but don't invite munch honest to god he's so irritating
i asked him to leave after tea and he pretended to fall asleep how do you know he was pretending i said munch can you go now and he went
you used to like your family gaz only cos they'd buy me things
munch will never buy me anything he'll never do anything for me the lazy monkey faced arse wipe is he behind me no he would be if we were in saved by the bell
sorry i was lying he is

flowers yes let's talk about your flowers as the skank suggests
shut up my parents aren't talking to me i don't want you falling out too aren't you inviting them

i've even seen his talking anus trick that's a solid relationship
no just give your mum and dad some space they'll get used to the idea excuse me donna you've no right to lecture after your fearsome grindings with my boyfriend i shagged david once in a time far far away now grow up and forget it janet she can't be your bridesmaid she's unpure and she's made my boyfriend unpure he's tainted by a love that dares not speak its name beastiality do not call me a beast why not it's not like you've never smelt of dung and quite frankly donna when was the last time you saw your dad oh yes he'd just come down with foot and mouth hadn't he then we'll see if anyone's dropped any kebab meat on the pavement
munch i don't want a stag do
who said you were invited me and jonny's practically family now how's that well you're my brother half that's the important bit half like half a lager or half a scargill
yeah but you're jonny's best man though right
so that makes me fall back best man no it doesn't tell him jonny i'm the chosen one you're not a friggin' jedi you said i can organise the wedding strippers not at weddings that's why i'm best man to put 'em there

gaz you're being unfair he doesn't mean it
unfair thanks a lot jonny fine let him be your best man but don't blame me when he swallows the ring

i don't wanna get married tomorrow
you've no choice unless you want separating from your penis
what's going on pete eh it's freezing in those stirrups
who was it with jonny no one what he was dressed as a woman
tonight we've solved the mystery of the sofas that could leave you in agony when you sit on them but there's another one after hearing the risks why are some stores still selling them
as they all battle for our business which energy company is the one experts now say is britain's worst
including the leather sofas that left hundreds of you with an agonising rash like this and if you think it looks bad imagine what it feels like
since our last report on this we have worked out what causes the problem but there have been a few other twists and turns
we've plenty of good news tonight as well and we've repeated a test we did last year to see how long some of britain's biggest names can he keep you hanging on the telephone line when you ring them up
you can text us on any of our stories or any of your stories it'll cost the price of a standard text
or you can email or call us we'll read the details out at the end of the programme
for the second time in a business that's found a new way of misleading its customers
many people can get into bother over whether they have or have not told the truth here's another david reynolds hardly a household name but his businesses are developing quite a reputation for being economical with the truth this is the h. q. of his main outfit here in west sussex satellite direct u. k. limited a company we revealed in march can all too often replace fact with fiction they were say anything to get your business and if that meant lying or bullying no problem in fact that's how they trained staff to treat their customers we'd received over one hundred complaints from people saying they were sold warranties for their sky t. v. system when they didn't need them but they bought them because they thought they were talking to sky so we sent a researcher to work at the company under cover and she was given a masterclass in cold calling tactics oh no they're not especially when they're at a customer's expense and the company has been in serious trouble for telling them in the high court satellite direct u. k. limited was ordered to stop their staff passing themselves off as sky when calling potential customers the judge called their sales techniques a blatant lie our researchers found that although staff don't actually say they're from sky they're happy for customers to get that impression when we first investigated this lot they were careful to avoid answering our questions and having their lies exposed on the telly wasn't enough to make them change their ways because plenty of you are telling us they're still at it just two weeks after our programme one of their sales staff called helen lee
she was saying about the warranty running out they never actually said they were sky but they made me believe they were sky and i had no doubts that they were sky
helen set up a direct debit for what she'd been led to believe was a sky warranty she tried to cancel as soon as she found out it wasn't
the paperwork arrived and when i saw the name satellite direct i recognised the name and thought oh no that's the company i'd seen on watchdog
after hearing lots more stories like that we wanted to get back undercover to find out more and guess what they were still recruiting two weeks ago we sent another researcher to work undercover he's discovered it's not just warranties they train their staff to mislead customers about they've got a whole new trick up their sleeve they'll still try to sell you something you may not need but this time it's one of these on his first day our researcher was told he would be working in another part of david reynolds' empire a business called not just aerials who will cold call making out you need a new t. v. aerial because of something none of us can avoid the digital revolution by two thousand twelve all t. v. services in the u. k. will go digital and to be ready all you'll probably need is a freeview box or a t. v. with a built in receiver but not just aerials train their staff so customers believe something different most people simply don't need to upgrade their aerial but the very carefully worded script our researcher was told to use suggests you will be in trouble if you don't when not just aerials called richard bangs they gave him the impression his aerial would be useless
the person told me that without a digital aerial i wouldn't be able to receive digital television i'm receiving pictures and i can see no reason why that was important
we asked david reynolds to comment on his latest wheeze but again he wouldn't answer our questions so we went to his h. q. to put them to him in person is david reynolds here please do you know where he is i bet he's got a big car
he's not in the office this afternoon
david reynolds must've been off somewhere in his big car and nobody at the company would talk to us until they'd spoken to their lawyers and even when they had they had nothing to say can you tell me why not just aerials is selling aerials to people who don't need them
sorry she's just advised me that i do not speak to you
you're not to say anything
no sorry but if you go through the lawyers they will be pleased to help you
we've heard nothing from david reynolds since then it's fair to say we'll be keeping an eye on him and his various businesses
last year we did a test to see how long some companies can keep you hanging on the phone before you get through to a real person we had some horrendous delays on one occasion well over an hour with british gas but all the companies insisted their performance would get better you know what they were right
we've done that test again ringing the same companies sky virgin media talk talk orange and british gas we rang each of them one hundred times at various times of the day and most of them answered almost immediately especially sky and virgin media both of whom averaged around ten seconds to get through not bad
no pretty good british gas still sometimes took a little longer but even they answered two thirds of our calls in under five minutes our longest wait was just one hundred fifteen minutes not perfect but a massive improvement on how they did last year so well done all those companies
we like passing on good news on watchdog so here's a bit more
over this series one hundred thirty thousand of you have contacted watchdog as a result we've investigated everything from high street banks to the inland revenue losing your details we've even had some familiar faces helping us out
stop exploiting our fans and give them their tickets or their money back or we're gonna come and get you
yes yes
scary and it worked
they may as well wipe the table with a toilet brush in fact i have tested toilet seats and toilet lids and found much cleaner results
k. f. c. told us they'd be retraining staff at all their seven hundred twenty branches so we went back to see if that would make a difference and it has this time we found the bacteria levels were well within acceptable limits and those grotty cloths well at the branches we went to they don't use them any more they've switched to paper towels
these results are encouraging because it looks as though the restaurants have taken on board the comments from the watchdog report some of the results were very clean and a few of them were spotless which indicates that they must be using a sanitiser together with paper towel so that's really good practice
and there was swift action from another big name samsung after we revealed that thanks to a fault the fridge that looked cool on the outside most definitely wasn't always cool on the inside
we noticed that the temperature had gone up right up and the food was starting to spoil
this fridge is not fit for purpose it should never have been put on the market
but after our investigation samsung extended the warranty on the r. s. twenty one so that any developing this fault within five years will be fixed free of charge and that has saved dozens of fridge owners like marilyn crewe hundreds of pounds
i rang the number that they gave out on watchdog they've extended my warranty they've got engineers out who fixed it straight away i'm delighted because that fridge was about to end up on the local dump
i don't want to be dictated to on how i pay my bills as long as i pay them and they get their money that's it
it seemed b. t. wouldn't budge but from mid two thousand eight they'll be introducing a new service b. t. basic for people on benefits and low incomes including many pensioners if they choose not to pay by direct debit there will be no extra charge when watchdog calls companies really do listen and it's thanks to you that we know which ones to go after so to all those big names we know who are listening we may be taking a break but we haven't gone away nope we haven't gone away most certainly not keep your e. mails coming we'll be reading them over the summer
energy companies are in the news again today there's speculation prices will go up again but what about customer service for one big name here is some very bad news indeed
in the energy business competition is tough the big names all want to come out on top and none of them wants the reputation for being the worst that rather dubious honour used to belong to british gas or at least it did in terms of the number of complaints but it seems there's a new contender npower britain's fourth biggest energy supplier with sixty eight million customers but as we revealed in march rather slow off the mark when it comes to their bills you were telling us they couldn't do the simplest of sums since then we've been overwhelmed with people telling us their npower bills are wrong over the last two months we've had more than four hundred fifty complaints more than twice as many as the same period last year
when eighty nine year old bernard jones received extremely high bills his sister looked into it
when he got the bill for nine hundred he said to me i've paid that in the past for a whole year if that's one quarter i can't do it
beatrice has worked out that npower has been charging bernard at the wrong rate for the last year she has told npower this a number of times but they just won't listen and now because he's refused to pay for their mistake they have called in the debt collectors
the humiliation the insult as well as the anxiety just seems so unfair because it was dealing with an elderly person who does not have the energy any more to pursue and pursue and pursue and pursue
gary northolt also had problems with npower and he is not even their customer his father was but he died in september
when the final bill arrived it was for eighty six i wrote it a cheque and sent it off and thought nothing more about it
but npower had got confused they sent another final bill this time for nearly three hundred and then they sent another and another and each time it for was for a different amount as far as gary was concerned he had settled the account so he told them he was not going to pay their response again the debt collectors
i think npower have been very inconsiderate it's just sad for the family and all of us it makes you feel sick inside that they are keeping on and on about owing money especially when you know that there is no bill to pay
it's not only us you've been complaining to about npower we were given an exclusive look at the official figures from energywatch and there is no doubt about the company they say is miles behind everyone else
we now have a new champion as the worst energy supply in britain it's npower i was amazed that any company could be worse than british gas at their accounts and billing system you have a complete failure of complaint handling and customer service
according to energywatch the company currently best is scottish and southern energy they say npower must dramatically improve
npower have to face up to the scale of the problem and face up to the fact that they get it wrong everywhere get an action plan that will tackle this from the root cause up to the consumer experience and then commit publicly commit on watchdog to say we will be the best in the market or at least around the average by later this year
the most complained about energy company is a title nobody wants but if they want to lose that particular accolade it looks as if npower has a long way to go
we hoped npower might want to come in unfortunately not but they told us they are focused on improving their performance they're confident that as staff become familiar with their new billing system there will be an improvement in customer service
they will be putting right the cases in our film and offering them a goodwill gesture as an apology but interestingly they reckon the number of complaints is dropping every year but that is not what we or energywatch have found
modern technology can be wonderful provided you can make yourself understood
wed what's the matter with you
another colour wed
the nintendo d. s. uses voice recognition software in some of its games but since we revealed it can struggle with regional accents and some women's voices you have sent suggestions on how to make yourself understood
i know i've got a scottish accent but it's not strong

voice recognition software isn't just for games it is in all sorts of useful gadgets like hands free devices in cars it should make life easier so why do some of you say it's driving you round the bend jane bollen bought a new ford fiesta eighteen months ago it has sophisticated voice recognition technology supposed to allow her to control the car's entertainment system and make phone calls hands free just by speaking but she can't get it to work the voice recognition system doesn't pick up my voice properly
the kids think it is hilarious but i find it frustrating
have they given you any advice on how to modify your delivery
yeah ford told me i have either got to speak more clearly or lower my voice to speak like a man
they said that yes i went for a spin with jane to see if using all the right voice commands i'd have any more luck phone oh two oh eight
oh two oh eight continue
it sounds like the car has no problem with my voice but it still dials the wrong number dial number
nine hundred ninety nine what no
nine hundred ninety nine that was the watchdog number we like to sort out problems but we are not nine hundred ninety nine that was extraordinary
nine hundred ninety nine that's definitely the wrong show ford say they are sorry their voice recognition system hasn't met helen's expectations but they insist the majority of customers are happy and benefit from the convenience and safety it provides the technology meets international standards but it is relatively complex so it does require precise operation they promised to help helen with hers and on our website there are tips for anyone else having problems
next a story that had a huge impact when we looked at it in february the sofas that left some people in excruciating pain we are still being sent pictures of the mysterious rash that for many became an unbearable injury needing urgent medical attention and the cause leather sofas like these
tonight hundreds of people left with an agonising itch or even in hospital after sitting on the sofas they bought from some of the biggest names in the business
those sofas contained a nasty surprise for people sitting on them a surprise that none of them could have imagined and which they will never forget
i fell asleep on my sofa i woke up a few hours later and my back was covered in a blistered rash
the sofas to blame were made by one chinese manufacturer linkwise most were sold through three retailers argos land of leather and high street chain walmsley's not everyone who sits on them gets a reaction but after our report in february hundreds of you told us you had had the same terrible symptoms from the same sofas for most of you what made the agony even worse was that you had no idea what was causing it until you saw watchdog david barrett bought a new suite from argos last february by august his skin had started to react violently
it was pure agony day in day out constantly the skin was breaking down and releasing a lot of water it got to the point where i was sleeping in the bath in red hot water just to make the itching stop for an hour
david's condition got so bad he was admitted to hospital for three days and put on an antibiotic drip even then he had no idea what was causing it it wasn't until his parents saw watchdog that he realised
it was like relief finally i have the answer i've been looking for
argos had recalled all the sofas they thought were affected but david's wasn't in those batches since then they have recalled more and they agreed to exchange david's for one that doesn't cause him a problem david was lucky he got his sofa from argos if he had bought it from walmsley's he could still be stuck with it walmsley's sold a marco suite to sandra edwards last year soon after she came out in a mysterious rash
it started off as a red patch and then an itch and then it blistered and cracked it was through the night through the day during work constantly there waking you up
she had no idea it was the sofa causing the rash until a relative saw the watchdog report despite complaining to walmsley's and sending them a doctor's letter she is still stuck with the sofa after nearly three months
i can't sit on it i have paid money for something i can't sit on i sat on a camp chair for two and a half months i just want rid of it
no one knew for sure why these sofas were causing rashes the manufacturers linkwise were even still claiming any skin problems were nothing to do with their sofas that left argos and others trying to get to the bottom of it they tested various possible explanations including chemicals used in the dying process none of them provided the answer but our evidence led us to believe that the chief suspect was this an innocent looking sachet hidden away in the sofas so we sent it away for testing and it turns out we were right the sachets contain a fungicide designed to stop mould growing while the sofa is in storage or transit consultant dermatologist doctor sandra winhoven was in charge of the testing of our sachet
after the last watchdog programme you kindly provided some samples which were sent to sweden they were analysed by a team there and they found that they contained dimethyl fumarate which is a fungicide dimethyl fumarate is known to cause skin irritation
it's thought that when the sofa gets hotter for example when someone sits on it the chemical in the sachet vaporises it can then get through the leather into clothing and onto the skin sandra's conducted patch testing with this chemical on patients affected by the sofas
we have so far tested eight patients and seven out of eight tested positive we are pretty certain that the dimethyl fumarate is the cause of the sofa dermatitis outbreak
argos's own investigations confirm our findings lawyer richard langton is representing many of the people affected by this issue
we've had over two hundred fifty new clients come to us who've been affected by the furniture we have discovered that these people have often suffered for months they've been to the doctor's but didn't know what was wrong as a result of seeing the watchdog programme a lot of people got treatment
the sachet we had tested came from inside one of these sofas the marco sold at walmsley's back in february we were surprised that they were still selling models that had been linked with these reactions we thought after our report they'd stop but no unbelievably they're still on sale sometimes at knock down prices
i'm astonished that anyone is still selling the furniture i don't think this furniture should be for sale now unless somebody is absolutely certain that the furniture is free of the chemical
the legal action being led by richard on behalf of those that have suffered is also progressing fast today in the high court nearly one thousand victims of these sofas launched the u. k.'s biggest ever class action of its kind suing the shops where they bought them for damages there still could be hundreds more people out there who don't realise it could be their sofa causing that rash
well incredibly the manufacturer linkwise still maintains the problem is nothing to do with their products meanwhile argos has reiterated that they very quickly withdrew potentially affected sofas from sale and they've made it clear they no longer sell any sofas made by linkwise land of leather have told us they don't either
walmsley's have placed no new orders with linkwise for the last two months their policy with the ones they have already sold is to offer an exchange or refund when customers send a doctor's note confirming they've had a reaction and though sandra edwards is adamant that she sent this the company has no record of receiving it but they will now take away her sofa and refund the cost walmsley's also say they have commissioned their own tests into the problem and haven't yet reached a final view
both walmsley's and argos who have done a detailed investigation say the chemical in those sachets will deteriorate over time so they believe the chances of further problems are slim let's hope so
argos has given us the number for customers to call you can find it on our website bbcco.uk slash watchdog that web address is where you can keep sending your stories for us to investigate while we take a break over the summer but not a holiday
thank you for your texts most of them about satellite direct this just about sums it up dave from finchley they won't take no for an answer we will be back in the autumn we'll be working hard over the autumn until then
from all of the watchdog team have a great summer
the middle of may but there are still up three weeks to go in the domestic rugby season today we had their semi finals of the guinness premiership lawrence dallaglio's last home game against a side who have played some spectacular rugby all season and he wanted revenge in this end of season grand final foster leicester is a repeat of last year's semi final gloucester leicester their coach's job could have depended on this game also this week martin johnson's first england squad another big man was put into the reject bin ryan echo low amongst those who have been dumped perhaps surprisingly plenty to talk about but we will focus on these two semi finals by nicole low the general standard has gone up a notch or two vainikolo there was one last chance for the crowd at wasps to see someone who was great for their side on wednesday night lawrence dallaglio received a special presentation for his eighteen seasons with the club the next generation know only too well how much they owed the former england captain and how much he wanted to go out on a high
he is going to be up for it everyone is going to send him a good farewell because he has been such a good ambassador for the club
it was a very stressful week fought the last year in advance of this on wednesday his six year old son was attacked by the family dog resulting in the animal being put down and leaving his son with several facial injuries although he was well enough to attend today's semi final it was watched by brian moore and andrew cotton looking ahead to this meeting in the sunshine at adams park it is hard to complain so much at stake player of history between the two sides and so much talent on display teilleria at the helm dallaglio at the helm there is news that ibanez is a late withdrawal instead joe ward takes his place bath also have hooker problems masters of the players wasps three times champion but it is barkley and bath who get things under way teilleria gets early hands on the ball dallaglio he winners the first penalty for wasps
some handsome fellows there yes yes two wanted men both sides having lost their first choice hooker shortly before the game it will be a crucial aspect of the game bath will have surely the first shot at goal the first shot at three points applause all round
i think the referee got that one right he is only guessing as indeed am i but it looked to me that barnard's was under pressure bernard was under pressure
he kicked his last fifteen in pressure the premiership bill them up and mcleod at adams park were not come down that was a wild one from barkley build them up the crab at adams park will not come down
worrying for bath not so for wasps the crowd a hearty thump down the field maddock finds space he wheels round and bounces off a tackle bath now with space sackey now looking for the interception and he finds it but the whistle will bring them back
i think it is going to be an offside from the brewing of the crowd i think it almost certainly is bouin
another chance for barkley
one a respectful hush and my goodness that is another wild halt
well he looks astonished he may be because
the line out a grizzled old veteran grabs it wasps are under real pressure now they have to buy themselves bit of space for the clearing kick cipriani a try for bath for crockett a gift
a well what can you say well what can you say he takes it just at the last second just as he is about to receive the ball see how much time he has got he has no time whatsoever
they are
going to the video referee what what for
get on the deck get on with it they do five points kittens
it was louis's mistake but almost the team collectively for trying to work
their way out of that position why why are they trying to run the ball anyway before the break down i do not know it should have been box kicked down the field as far as it could have been
two attempts from barkley so far far far more straightforward this one bath score and
that angle home and dry as soon as he cut the line a fantastic riposte by eighteen who know their way around the play offs l. l. wonder how much bath will miss their rue
inconceivable that wasps would not
cannot award a try please
it is a positive question from chris white they believe a try has been scored by riki flutey let's have a look no doubt at all
thank you
of how bath responded to the first riposte this is the first passage of play where they had to respond i got the feeling in that bath when they were walking back after the first call looked a bit shell shocked as if to say to themselves
posts now wasps have their chance cipriani always tried to carry off
the unexpected looks to be in
bit of trouble cipriani he has hurt his ankle all his calf
do not know whether it is a broken ankle or just toe and ligaments but the food was inverted at an angle before twas inverted at an angle which he should not be able to reach what a horrible moment in a game of celebration at the end of the season so much up for grabs and a young man's korea will be
cruelly cut into his career the scrum is being heaved all over the place there bath have another
chance they have a penalty bath lost the ball and then committed a penalty to stop the resulting bath move but that came directly from them being unable to get a stable platform from which to hook their own ball
seven points adrift of the two straightforward chances that olly barkley missed at the start of the game a chance here to at least chip away at that wasps' lead
should have counted he did not look at the run by palmer perfectly timed i suggest that that is a winning score
in the process tom voyce has picked up an injury he is off van gisbergen remains and keeps the extra points it is a big lead now for wasps wasps showboating their way to twickenham the clock ticks towards eighty minutes the crowd are asking for the whistle a fraction early they count down to twickenham it is calling once more wasps will once more head down a road they know so well and nothing will stop at great gladiator de la neo leading his side out there the victory has come at quite a cost be great gladiator de la earlier an awful looking injury for danny cipriani we wish him all the best he will certainly not be at twickenham but wasps will be there one more game before the end for doolally old perhaps one more trophy for lawrence dallaglio
i thought we were immense we had to oak up lot of pressure we did dominate bath's attack they have been in great shape
i think we played reasonably well in the first thirty minutes just could not quite finished that form continued throughout the second half where things did not quite work but that is the way of the game wasps defended very well thankfully it was not a one sided semi final as we saw last season
our defence is a major part of winning performances today it was definitely the case we had the ball for thirty or forty per cent of the game to play as well as we did was crucial
we drew lot of today's aggression from the fact that we had been written off a few bath players said they wanted to finish us off and that spurs the guys on obviously it is disappointing the guys were shocked by danny's injury and tom voyce's injury we have two weeks to prepare for massive game and bring out the stops
the guys are devastated you work as long as you do all season to get to the finals and to miss out is devastating we all have our goals and to miss out like that is disappointing i thought the effort was outstanding it always is with our team but our execution let us down and we missed out on the score board the headlines tomorrow will beyond that terrible injury to danny cipriani brian moore is in the studio now off do you know what the situation is
we have to wait for the scan obviously the lead is broken as you can see from the footage but there are other things that can go wrong dislocations spinal fractures they are all key to being a four to six month injury
whenever there is a serious injury players react like they do when the players react like that and play stops you know it is serious
the coaches were obviously very concerned at that situation and danny got a tremendous reception when he was carried off did that have an impact on the wasps team immediately how difficult is it to put that to one side
not have that now all of us wish danny the very best let's talk about the game what did you make of it
second riki flutey scored for you he has been outstanding player
yeah the argument about foreign players playing for england will crop up with him
would you pick him in the england team
irreplaceable and yet your defence very rarely did you look like being breached is that all the shaun edwards factor
it was a large part that but you are beginning to see you now eighty teams moving away from the old school thinking of winning the scrum at wasps we have never done that we still won the game some teams spend hours sorting of those phases out but we do not do that obviously it is a big priority to get them right the more you win the easier the game becomes but we prioritise our defence and attack if you get your attack right and not expose yourself to turnovers it is all those facets of the game that have been secret of our success
at times but they tried everywhere they could think of to get round the defence and none of them worked some of the kicks they were putting behind were too long and when it came to outflanking people
we thought the guys were above them in terms of form at the moment l. spoke to lesley and explained that to him and they understood lesley has had some injury issues he worked it would be good for both those guys to have a decent break and as coaches our fitness team will also speak to them and let them know where we think they need to improve in terms of getting back into the squad so although they are not going they are not discarded they are part of a wider selection process of who is available iain
the players deserve their place in the squad and it is as tough a tour as you can experience in international play it is a tough arena so whether they get on the field or not they will come back as more experienced players
through everything good and bad with the players it is a bit awkward to be left at home we put the squad together we made the decisions in terms of who does not go and then we get on with it we come back on the first july and need to pick the squad it will be great
to go get together with the players if you did not see the squad who england have named you can see some familiar names as well as some unfamiliar ones as you move on to the back division some changes there too
the preceding five years now he has complete power he will be able to bring his tough edge to their game but he always understood the wider picture that is a big thing
i think it was a slightly misleading question really the wrong premise really that role was not there before that is what we have been shouting about for so long get the structure sorted out and fit the people into it now they have done that everyone can move forward they can only be one person in charge but the problem was who would it be
the have been through that before
be delighted about that
i am sure everyone is pleased there was no other contender close to him
we just stuck at it especially when we were down to thirteen men we stayed in the game it was not our best rugby but we stayed close stuck at it when you get andy goode on your side great finish you always stand chance
we got what we deserved the boys were playing for six or seven weeks when you come to these final stages you will get knocked down if you play poorly we have to accept accountability that was a game we should have won easily we took options that we did not understand we committed suicide in the second half when all we needed to do was calm things down and play the percentages and be patient we were not any of those things when you are not you are out we have not got anywhere to go from there
really happy the players made a very good game we knew it was going to be hard but we knew that we had to win the collisions we had to play on the front foot against gloucester gloucester is a very intense and physical teamed but we knew that if we could dominate on that we could have a chance maybe to win the game and the players did a great performance
in the week that avram grant takes chelsea to moscow how can leicester be talking about getting rid of the man that got them to the final
it is a lot if he wins he final is probably safe if they do not win they may still take that option but i hope it is not the start of the football short termism coming in you have to give people chances and about the people who picked him where are they in their job you have pick someone who has only lasted six months they should give him more time
it was an extraordinary game but in a sense it swung on that bizarre try for aaron mauger when iain balshaw through a pass that he will probably wonder why he did it how did you see this
games are often lost on silly mistakes like these bad kick followed by bad pass it has cost us games basic errors teams that go on to win make very few basic errors like this giving away tries you defend so well for the duration of the match and then
he is remember game he won with one of the most outrageous drop goals i have ever seen he is one of the men i would have taking a shot like that
you were not expecting him to be playing in the final you have an awful number of people missing like danny cipriani how do you read the match in two weeks' time
quite a margin the history has been that one side is really good i remember the year that wasps physically dominated leicester and vice versa l. think wasps will have a hard time
scarlikeekeekee didn't know any of these before scarlikeekeekee thought a pint of beer was two glass of win was one
do you know your limits a new campaign warns of the dangers of drinking yourself to an early grave
it's chelsea flower show perfect
people then you wouldn't want them to ban this kind of treatment nobody should be allowed to suffer and putting it bluntly motor neurone disease is a death sentence
they are create being creating what is ethically quite wrong something which is animal and human that goes against every kind of moral teaching that we've ever known
of those asked didn't realise that a large glass of wine contained three units two thirds didn't realise a double gin and tonic is two units one third didn't know an average pint is two units as well this advertising campaign's designed to push home the safe drinking message
did you know that if women regularly exceed two to three units a day it could add up
being a very fun activity particularly drinking to the point of intoxication could be a lot of fun there was no evidence young people were taking account of the units they were drinking and indeed drink to a point monitoring your drink anything that way went against their objective which was to get drunk
when we showed the new ads to these drinkers it did have an impact
oh my god you might as well not even drink
scarlikeekeekee would never have known this even if it doesn't do
to this meeting the problem is it really works by consensus the idea they'll put a lot of pressure on the burmese is not really the way things work what they'll be hoping is they'll hear from the burmese foreign minister the situation on the ground as for as he's concerned they'll hope that through their discussions they can try to persuade him to accept some kind of aid effort the focus seems to be on persuading burma to accept aid channeled through its neighbours british aid for example coming through neighbouring countries and branded if you like as asyan aid
and the burmese are more likely to accept accept help from their neighbours rather than what they
the former mining town of merthyr tydfil used to have a proud working tradition today nearly one in five is on the sick many of them long term when did you last have a job
the government thinks more than a third of the two million incapacity claimants could work with support it's rolled out a nationwide back to work programme new research suggests unless lots of new job is created in south wales north east england and parts of scotland the government is unlikely to get more than half a million back to work
we have to help the individuals which is what the government is increasingly inclined to do that involves retraining physical rehabilitation we have to grow the local economies where the claimants are particularly concentrated

currently in law to take into consideration the child's need for a father or father figure before treating a woman for i. v. f. or donor insemination whatever
do you think this is a good idea
no i don't think it's a good idea for several reasons because firstly it's making a decision before that come into being it's making a decision that it doesn't need a father or even a father figure i just don't think that we're remotely in a position as a society to be able to make that decision lots of people say that it doesn't matter but the research is inconclusive and the direction is all based on it's very adult centred at the moment l. totally understand that people have a heart that want children that wants a child to love and that all feels very very loving but the experience from adoption the experience from donor conceived people is that even if your parents are kind of lavishing love upon you if there's something that's sort of rather complex in the way the very way you came into being all the loving instincts in the world don't repair tha
thank you for talking to us this morning here's an issue for you if you're getting your children up and ready and breakfasted and trying to find the football kit are you going to let your children walk to school this morning or will you drive them because you're worried they might get hurt apparently so called cotton wool kids eventually face ace greater risk of being injured on our streets when they go out on their own our correspondent is at a school in hartlepool good morning i'm here at clavering primary school here it's like many schools we know the yellow signs warning this is a school area there are the speed bumps these are the things which the school has put in place to make children safer what we heard today is a call for parents to let their children walk to school more often rather than driving them why statistics show if your eleven year old goes to secondary school you're twice as likely to be killed our injured than a ten year old going to primary school in secondary school you get to walk yourself instead of being dropped off let's talk to two guests who know about this issue leslie has her children here rachel and luke how worried are you about these statistics
i do real aisles there is more chance of people being knocked over if they haven't walked luke moves to secondary in september i'm hoping i can teach him the skill that's he needs to be able to deal with the
yes it's every parents nightmare of an accident on the way to school even in this relatively quiet area there are dangers about in under three months pupils in year six will be making the journey to secondary school over a mile they'll have to cross a maine road they'll have to be there for eight thirty a m. on dark mornings we're conscious of our job in training the pupils so that they are fully aware of the dangers that will be there
to pretend either that time had stood still
housing market there could be
everything is becoming much more last minute in terms of people confirming their removals and giving us dates they can move for instance we had a customer who was provisionally booked in for next week she phoned us in a flood of tears yesterday having lost her by she now knows she has to go through
people who were evicted where houses are repossessed have to find a mover to get them out it will be a positive effect on the business but a negative effect on everybody else
until buyers start sticking my neck out and the bank's help them stick them out further it looks like some time before homeowners will be on the move again you have been saying in york e. mails and texts of that falling house prices is good news for first time buyers but it isn't as helpful as you might think royal institution of chartered surveyors also says that first time buyers are not getting the mortgages they need to take advantage of the falling prices so tomorrow we'll look at renting as more people who want to buy their first home back can't stay in rented accommodation which means rents are likely to rise next year all bit gloomy isn't it yes he could have free bus travel by now and explore britain but one oap has as different adventure harrison ford is back as indiana jones taking on the baddies during the cold war the film was premiered last night at the cannes film festival the cannes film festival finds it hard to resist hollywood stardust and these people are hollywood royalty this art house film festival has lost its heart to a film which has blockbuster written all over it indiana jones is back and knowingly the film acknowledges the gap that since the last movie

which is animal and human that goes against every kind of moral teaching that we've ever known
yes the story that two women were pulled from a building not far from here in beichuan one of them sixty one years old they were pulled alive we're just about to mark the week the time exactly one week since when the earthquake let me ask ben if you can move the camera over there are troops and firemen standing outside they have wreaths with them they're waiting to mark the three minute silence they're outside beichuan middle school it's on the hillside back there there's nothing left it it's been wiped from the face of the earth by the mountain the only thing remaining is the fling in fact it's still flying high all acoing china the flags will be flying at half mast just beyond these men the body bags are coming out they're spraying ammonia to reduce the risk of disease if you give me a moment i'll show you over here to give you an idea of the devastation this entire town this entire area has been virtually wiped from the map as we were come anything here they were digging mass graves in some senses the entire town of beichuan is a mass grave
tharving you thank you very much after seven thirty a m. we speak it chinese woman live anything london she's been fundraising for people affected by the earthquake we'll find out how hard it is to get in touch with loved ones caught up in the disaster here warnings about how much alcohol it's safe to drink still don't seem to be getting through seventy five per cent of those questioned in a survey for the department of health couldn't say how many units were in a glass of wine today the government launches a new careful drinking campaign when you go out for drink do you know how much alcohol you're having we've been bombarded with information about alcohol units for years but it seems lot of us are still not getting the message how many units do you think are in that
asked didn't realise this large glass of wine contains throw units two thirds didn't realise double gin and tonic is two units and one third didn't know that an average pint contains two units as well this advertising campaign is designed to push home the safe drinking message
did you know if women regularly exceed two to three units a day it could add up to a
the young people we spoke to in our study represent drinking as being a very fun activity particularly drink to a point of intoxication could be a lot of fun there was no evidence that young people were taking account of the units they were drinking indeed drinking to a point monitoring your drink anything that way totally went against their objective primarily to get drunk
when we showed the new ads to these drinkers it did have an impact
oh my god you
i would never know this so even if it doesn't do
well it's very difficult for us to get a clear picture of what's going on if burma and for aid workers too rangoon itself the principal city has been pretty well cleared up the trees have been removed from the roads and people are restoring the electricity pylons the city has really been sealed off for foreigners we were unable to get out through check points aid workers can't get out either the hard hit areas the cyclone hit areas in the delta are inaccessible it's difficult to know where to channel what aid is coming through some estimates say as many a twenty five million people are in need
it's also the answer to the tory leader's live webcam broadcasts from his breakfast cable which made him appear more in touch with digital technologies so does gordon brown get it well as the site goes live he's the opening speaker at google's event of the year clear recognition of the need to reconnect with younger generation of voters and to make the prime minister appear more accessible and human last week we spoke to neil diamond on the programme since then things are getting better and better for him let's hear bit of him reaching out touching me touching you sweet caroline he's top of the pops here and in america with his latest album home before dark the success comes more than forty years after the release of his debut album he's never had number one on the bill board two hundred br

thanks what you fancy
this has got to be the last one all right what a week
might as well finish it off
did you know that if men regularly exceed three or four units a day it could lead to a serious health problem
why are we so bad it knowing our minutes witnesses the director of education at the british liver trust we have had this message before but it does not really get across why is that
it is quite confusing for people how much alcohol there is in an ordinary drink we know that wind and peers are often stronger than they used to be class sizes as well what used to be a standard glass is now a much lassa at larger glass this used to be a standard glass of wine but if you go out to many pubs or bars you often get served with these larger glasses which are two hundred fifty mills
that is a third of a bottle of wine
yes and this class here which many bears may have at can take up to half a bottle of wine
the reason the alcohol trade serves it in larger glasses is because they make more money don't they
the problem is that people often don't know how many units they are consuming in the smaller glass that will be around two units just over two units in the larger glass three possibly three point five units depending on the strength of the wind
the wine glass used to be one hundred twenty five millilitres surely it is down to consumer demand are we going into pubs and asking for bigger glasses
that is fine but we need to recognise that if people are exceeding the government guidelines for how much alcohol they should have a day which for women is two to three units a day
which is what you get in here
that's right
but when you go to a pub or restaurant you ask for a glass of wine sometimes they say be goss moor you have no idea how big their glasses you are going to get big or small they should make it clearer
we need people to be able clearer to make informed choices and that means knowing how much alcohol they are buying and consuming if people are exceeding the government limits they could be putting themselves at increased risk of health harm which can be quite serious liver disease heart problem even cancer
so how many glasses like this could you have been a day and still remain healthy
saw a woman two or three units which is about what is in that class
give themselves two consecutive days a week without alcohol and that is the best way to you are not damaging yourself
ahead and bought lights so we can work under them despite all the pressure there is a much underwhelming sense that everybody is doing something they love
an overwhelming sense why there show up year after year it gets in the blood it is show ring off
i do it because nobody would have commissioned me to do this or to explore the idea of a cafe garden without having the space so chelsea is a jar us to experiment but things don't always go to plan
all i were at and it has split
everyone is driving force perfection and some plants just don't make the grade
they have selected the once the a want
we are going to try and help contain them it has all turned up beautifully last minute touches in andy sturgeon's garden
it's really important when we identify young talent and that young talent becomes role models that those role models encourage the next generation of local heroes to the table
your support and give us generously as much as you can
united in grief chinese people in britain come together to help survivors of the earthquake we talk to a couple of them in a minute before that time now for all the latest sports new chris is here good morning we are going to be talking to an olympic gold medalist in the making in a moment she's nervous she's over there she's a big breakfast fan
she is now aren't you kelly
yeah definitely
and became ill l. was in hospital i had to come home it means my season doesn't start for another month instead of starting at the end of this month in austria l. go into the olympics with no heptathlon under my belt that's a first for me
you've been training extremely hard the usual training but also your eyes one hear
yeah i never had an eye test for i'm thirty one i had one when i was eleven l. had one recently and found out that i could make a difference to my performance if i learn to focus a little more i've been training my eye muscles more so i can focus at hurdles taking off for high jump bars i'm hoping it will make a difference
how do
help tadge lodge is what together seven
which is your strongest events
i don't think i have my weakest at the moment is javelin but that's been getting a lot better so eight hundred running kind of is my strongest
at performing use the pressure wisely and direct it in good ways yeah i thrive under pressure and jessica too hopefully we'll have one and two on the podium that would be great coming first and second at the lifrpl it's quite likely it could happen
a lot of people keep saying she thinks she's old at thirty one
you're a baby she's
in twaz all right they're not as grumpy as i said
they're brilliant
thank you
tkhiena in tears is how one of the country's main newspapers has summed up the mood of that nation stunned and united in grief following the earthquake they came together short time ago to stand in silence and mourn the tens of thousands of people killed in the earthquake in sichuan province in some areas whole villages were wiped out as if they never existed just this morning two more survivors have been found we're hearing that more than two hundred relief workers though have been buried in a mudslide so still very dramatic events in china our correspondent quentin sommerville is in beichuan which has been virtually leveled by the earthquake he joins us now
good morning good morning the three minute silence has been sounded here it was more of a three minute wail air raid sirens were played and car horns and sirens from the troop vehicles here all rang out as emergency workers put down their tools and honoured the enormous loss that's been felt not just here in beichuan which has been practically wiped from the map but across china we're standing just outside what was beichuan middle school there's nothing left of it the hill side engulfed the school many hundreds of children were lost as rescue workers stood there with the wreaths there were a numbers of bodies to the side they're now spraying ammonia and lime to control the risk of disease here really the sense of loss which is being felt all across china
they're fine at the moment my sister lives in chengdu my brother and brother lives about three hundred kilometres from the
to buy a aid and equipment in china but if people lock on to the embassy website there was see a whole list of equipment and medical supplies communications applies that they need
there must be part of either wants to go out
everything is becoming much more last minute in terms of people confirming their removals and giving a states they can be moved for instance we had a customer who was provisionally booked in for next week she phoned us in tears yesterday having lost her buyer she now knows she has to go through the whole programme at process again
the uncertainty is good news for some some people are doing well out of the gridlock in the housing market containers like these are full of belongings of people who have been forced down or caught between the runs in the property ladder tough times mean looking for new business as well as storage firms are also telling us there is a growing demand for repossessions until the buyer start sticking their necks out and banks help them it looks like it will be some time before homeowners are on the move again melanie bien is with me from savills private clients one of our regular commentators on the housing market first of all this news that they could be a fall in the
which means all this stuff about the current state of the housing market is helping people who want to get their first home because prices are more affordable but if they can't get the mortgages they want they are no better off
it should be the perfect situation for first time buyers but it is much harder for them to get finance to get an above ninety per cent loan so it does not matter what property prices are if they can't afford to buy them
this isn't going to be easy
not as easy as it used to be
indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull follows in the first steps nearly three decades ago are remarkably success abroad successful franchise in which harrison ford was effortless as the action hero but now he is nearly sixty six years old and much attention has focused on whether he is credible as an action hero for a young audience do you think it matters is it relevant
it isn't relevant to me l. do what
is required in the character
it is a really strong message of women coming together and having fun sometimes discussing sex sometimes relationships sometimes just how can i juggle the job and the baby
it is really important when we identify young talent and that young talent becomes a role model that those role models encourage the next generation of
i didn't know any of these i thought pint of beer was two a glass of wine one
new campaign aims to get parents and kids out of their cars and using their legs
good morning it's a chilly but sunny start for many across the country if we were to sit here for twelve hours we would be able to see the stars beautifully through this telescope but it looks as though the weather will be behaving itself for press day here at chelsea
then you wouldn't want them to ban this kind of treatment nobody should be allowed to suffer putting it bluntly motor neurone disease is a death sentence
did you know if women regularly exceed two to three units a day it could add up to a serious health problem
but some question what difference ads like this really make
the young people we will spoke to in our stud ji represent drinking as being a fun activity it canly drinking to the point of intoxication could be a lot of fun there was no evidence that young p. people were taking account of the units they were drinking or monitoring your drenging in that way went against their objective which was to go out and get drunk
when we showed the new ads to these drinkers it did have an impact
oh my god you
i would never have known this even if it it doesn't do nothing at least you know
question is how long will they remember the safe drinking message foreign ministers from south east asia are meeting in singapore today to discuss ways of helping victims of the cyclone which hit burma two weeks ago they're hoping the burmese generals who have blocked all but a fraction of the foreign aid offered so far might accept help from the other asian countries police who admitted what was thought to be a fragment of bone which sparked a massive search at the former children's home in jersey was more likely to be a piece of bone or coconut shell officers sail the search at haut de la garenne are continuing and other fragments at the site are definitely human some of england's rarest life is at risk of disappearing forever according to a report the report says the national countryside is under sieges from climate change pollution and aggressive new farming methods gordon brown has his own website even his own blog today he launches his own youtube version of prime minister's questions he is a promising to respond to questions on any subject last week gordon brown was everywhere doing a round of t. v. and radio interviews trying to explain the government's surprise three billion tax give weigh this week he's by passing a hostile media and going on line and personal instead with his ask the prime minister web forum click on to the new electoral palgts battleground part of the downing street's strategy to disprove the david cameron jibe that gordon brown is an and log politician in a digital aid
this will be a regular event i'll be here to answer your questions questions you have to about how globalisation is working what's happening to climate change how we can build the houses we need for the future how to do better with the health service and the different public services that government provides i'm here to answer your questions politicians get a chance in prime minister's question time and other question times i think it's time the public had a chance
we wanted to encourage the children to get out use their legs for the health and friendly the travel plan is a way of us bringing in certain initiatives to do that
let's talk to kids who walk to school here luke and amy luke you will cycled today do you enjoy doing that more than getting a lift
i do when you cycle you get exercise when you get dropped off you're not getting as much exercise
amy many children might think it's easier for them if they get lift what do you prefer
parent and also childminder how important is it for children's health that they walk
i think it's incredibly important yes for their health but also child development a lot of people overlook the fact that if they don't learn to use their legs and balancing walking on the pavement running over the grass they're not learning the little things they need to then go into school and be able to sit down in a class and write and do those kinds of things am
thank you i will let the children get into school breakfast club is beginning in a few moments this is busy wee school but what they're trying to do is encourage millions of children to use their legs instead of their cars coming up on the programme he has still got it harrison ford who swings into action as indiana jones she is begging us from mercy and we are gladly giving end the delectable duffy will be here on the sofa they are working hard down at chelsea it might look blooming marvellous but preparing for the chelsea flower show is hard graft and a labour of love did you spot duffy's talent in wales exactly breakfast blessed again you just would not believe the temperature here if i was in the sunshine or just the other side of the path it is little warmer unijet loves if you're standing outside for three or four hours you need your gloss loss you would not believe the hard work that is going on behind the scenes here the judges act as we speak the weather is behaving itself impeccably there is little cloud around primarily in scotland one or two isolated showers one or two running in the north sea coast pushing in through north yorkshire
and lincolnshire there is not
cloud in the sky in london some beautiful sunshine that will help to lift the temperatures the further south and west you come we are looking at temperatures of seven or eight degrees in the morning over to northern ireland plenty of clear skies there is at chance of seeing one or two isolated showers they should be fewer far between generally speaking a pleasant day in store this afternoon more cloud developing across the country it will stay predominantly dry twelve degrees in scotland and maybe sixteen or seventeen along the south coast through the night tonight we will continue to have quite actually all night to come particularly in the eastern half of the country temperatures in the cities around three degrees in rural parts they will be close to freezing another cool start the dry and sonny one tomorrow we see winds swinging around to south easterly direction warmer tomorrow seventeen is generally the high all in all plain sailing if you're coming down to the chelsea flower show from wednesday we could see this weather staying with us the weather behaving itself impeccably go and get yourself some sunshine will be back at chelsea later jules is down there without any shoes on is it frankenstein science or way to save and improve the lives of thousands of people should scientists be allowed to continue research on hybrid embryos part animal part human two very different sides of the argument with us now doctor kieran breen is from keirin let me start with you this is a very important day for people like you cells explain why m. p.'s should vote this through
the use of these embryos are very important to understand how stem cells work and how stem cells can be transformed from this we can understand how to treat conditions such as parkinson's there will run at and twenty thousand people in the u. k. with parkinson's this is one potential way of finding cure
there was no question that from
hybrid embryo that has a tiny bit of animal material there is no question of anything being born from that key match absolutely not
improve the lives of thousands over time a lot of our viewers who have parents with alzheimer's and parkinson's say if you can do anything to help these people it is worth at
there is big sensitivities year in that there is life in these embryos potentially human life which is distorted
these embryos will not be used to make animals they will not be placed in the womb they are tools to understand stem cell they would not be suitable for transplantation to treat or ultimately to cure conditions we do not know it may be years down the line before we will understand fully how this work and whether it would be suitable
to happen happen to them they're going to be abused destroyed they be allowed to grow and have a life they are destroyed
the m. b. o. will be affected
yes the reason behind these studies is that you grow up of the embryo will only be allowed to grow to fourteen days then they can be grown into nerve cells
stocking feet british gardeners have had lot to cope with in the last twelve months this elegant courtyard garden is designed precisely to cope with the prospect of a changing climate how did they create these masterpieces of show gardens we came down last week to have look at the work in progress
for many people this is the real chelsea it is labour of love
this is the worst job of all
as the deadline looms everyone starts to wonder if their creations will be ready on time the cancer research garden is already taking shape it is the contemporary woodland design the theme is progress and the wall of aluminium circles represents thought bottles you are notorious for really working under the wire
i am always last this year the contractors have been thinking ahead they have actually gone and bought lights
despite all pressure there is an overwhelming sense that everyone here is doing something they love why else would the bigger names shore up year after year
experiment but things do not always go to plan
although work and it has split
everyone is striving for perfection some plants do not make the grade
we have selected the ones we want they chose the gneisses plants and if they do not flower like that one it is a reject
years of planning weeks of hard graft at the end it could all come down to the life of the lily
the idea is to help contain them
a things you do for chelsea
i am thrilled to say we have got dermot gavin with us the report ended with people fingers crossed hoping it would turn out well your garden is looking very fine are you happy with it
yes i am it is great to see it off up
lots of people will say you're one of the most well known gardeners and the country you do not need to put yourself through it any more why do you do it
i asked myself that this morning it is about having an idea yourself nobody else has gone to do it unless they see it it is chance for you to become a client for your own ideas
i was talking to your plants expert towards the end of last week and she said one of the lovely things is it is work in progress why did you go for the multi stan
award at tea use an indian bean tree on the a single stem a wanted to use an indian bean tree on a single stem
spring has come late how much of a challenge has that been for gardeners here and dollar the country
we have to get used to one settled weather it has become story now and turns of chelsea i garden in real time do not think there should be pretension we should show people what actually happens in gardens
it looks fantastic good luck the judges are coming around very soon was that bloke in the suit and tie behind due
it is alan titchmarsh is more
astonishing news that here this morning in this baking heat it's been like this for many days now a week after the earthquake two women were found alive in beichuan of course though those are the exceptional cases then we heard not long afterwards that two hundred rescue workers have been lost as a result of land slides now i won't show you over this side but over there is where the beichuan middle school once was it's been engulfed by the hillside totally wiped out hundreds of children lost and now they're digging a mass grave at the side of the school if we look over this way you can get an idea of the extent of the devastation here this building was actually the planning and construction building for the town as you can see it's lying on its side there are some workers who have been sifting through the remains taking a moment's break this is perhaps one of the worst hit areas in china but all across this country they're feeling the loss they're feeling the enormous effects of this earthquake one week on where they're counting two hundred thousand people still in hospital as many as seventy thousand people dead they're wondering why so many of them were children and they're wondering what kind of future places like beichuan now have
have listen
touching me touching you sweet caroline
do you think he did his own stunts
course he did she can't be nancy niamh will be here she leaves i'd do anything also this morning kim cattrall she popped in to talk about sex in the city what did she say to make our bill blush
tell us about a garden dedicated to the former beatle she's begged us for mercy we have given in there she is duffy she's on the sofa that's all still to come before the end of the programme we'll hear her voice
we didn't hear this then and we find out he
it wasn't sport mate
her minders held you back
i'd like to have seen you go like this about the girly chat let's have some rugby chat now danny cipriani is set to miss the play off final after suffering a suspected broken ankle in yesterday's win over bath cipriani needed oxygen as he was stretchered from the field he dislocated his ankle as he was tackled by olly barkley bad news for his club of course also for the new england team manager that is martin johnson wasps had to trailed at home to bath before fraser waters and riki flutey crossed to put them ahead at halftime the visitors kicked a penalty before tom palmer confirmed their place in the final at the end of the month their opponents will be leicester willie walker dropped a goal to move gloucester two points ahead late in that game but this moment of magic from andy goode gave leicester the victory now the first test between england and new zealand looks to be heading for a draw michael vaughn scored his sixth century at lord's matching graham gooch's record and my favourite story of the morning richard finch won the irish open yesterday when you win a tournament you want to do it in style sadly that wasn't the case for richard his walk down the eighteenth was more like a waddle why this is why this was the third shot at the eighteenth nice swing but he ended up in the water thankfully his ball didn't it ended up on the green which meant he could secure a bogey and the title fpblt his second victory of the year we've all been tempted haven't we next time just pick up unless you want a pair of trousers full of water
he got on the green though
they may be smiling now but they're here in deadly earnest every one of them a top chef and determined to win a place at the banquet at least three of them won't make it
we're at the sharp end now if you mess up it's game over everyone's going to be so focused now
i don't do anything for silver or bronze medal l. go for the gold
there's no point competing at this level if you don't feel you can go all the way
leith and matthew fort their job is to scrutinise the starters and ward marks out of ten today's winner will be decided by combining the judges' scores with your votes the judges' marks will count for fifty per cent of the total and the public vote for vote will make up the other half those three judges are here prue leith oliver peyton and matthew fort good morning to you all let me start with you prue what's striking you about this year's lot
they're younger they're keener they've always been keen but these are more adventurous i think partly because they're young it's been huge fun they're great lot i really like the chefs it's the
never stop
why not
sandwiches as you may remember the history were made for people when they were gambling so they could pick up something in their hands and eat it
why does it need to stand still why can't food move forward and evolve
i don't want it to move forward if it's moving forward there's something wrong with it
fact that historically haute cuisine restaurants have found it difficult to sustain themselves because it's a weekend market but this time the amount of chefs producing extraordinarily high quality food outside london has really i've been taking by that fact at a world class level not just a british level
course was about british ingredients and allowing one of the programmeles i saw a big debate about coconut and all sorts of things that shouldn't be in there what are we looking at in terms of the final what do they need to have the chefs
the core ingredient has to be british and to their region as well beyond that i think that british cooking has always been enormously inclusive in borrowing ingredients from elsewhere
it has to be local seasonal but i think that's just a general trend all over the world it's partly to do with the environment people thinking let's have less air miles also to do with supporting farmers and people are more interested in where food comes from the fact that people are less iingnorpbts about food is the
best thing that's happened the the best thing for the gherkin is the chefs coming to taste the food are really we know what they're going to be expecting they're going to want to see originality because it's such a global world now everybody can see what other chefs are cooking round the world l. think with this batch of chefs that has been in this competition there is original cooking can you honestly say the dishes have defined the chef
it lasts for an hour people have the opportunity to vote for their favourite dish we rank them in order we think but they can choose anything that they feel
our great host and judge really
because this is the first time the shows have been longer it's interesting that they're longer because i mean the cooking is by far the most interesting that we've seen people will learn a lot from it i've learned lot
they can vote early and often
thank you very much we are not going bill
give me the cheque now
and time has moved on in terms of the plot as well the film is set in nineteen fifty seven
he wanted to make me butch in one sequence and hanging off the front of a truck with a machine gun blasting out trying to kill people he not only he normally does one or two takes and he did about eight or nine on a one i think because he enjoys seeing me with their machine gun
while the story is always a quest the franchise can predict the answer box office gold all high minded sensibilities of this festival the presence of the fourth indiana jones film here has caused great excitement not just among its fans but also critics whenever cannes meets hollywood they do get on well together you can see more of that interview with harrison ford on the b. b. c. website well we have reached the semi finals of i'd do anything one more nancy has been stripped of her locket niamh was sent home last night welcome to the programme let's hear when she learned her fate
it is time to find out who is ultimately good enough andrew andrew you must decide rachel or niamh who will use save
it is a very difficult song to sing that jumpers a nasty one indeed if i was casting evita i would seriously be thinking of you for that role rachel you handled it very well you warm it into the song but it is the most difficult decision ultimately tonight i
this is what i don't understand his lordship says if i was casting evita you would get the job and
they said very positive things for you from the get go you are destined to be a pop singer and a couple of years you would be a leading lady on the west end stage but throughout there was say you were too small too young and too cute they were wondering whether you had that nancy in you
that was always the question in a way i am quite pleased that the query was about something i have no control over l. can't make myself are older and i don't want to change myself
at the same time while been complemented denise did say you sounded more like a teenager having a tantrum and a leading lady which wasn't very kind
no but it is their job and it is constructive criticism so why does not to upset by that
what i find difficult is that when you have to say which other gulls wouldn't be nancy l. can't remember who you said
i kind of said it honestly does not mean a huge demand we all hate doing it in all honesty none of us really mean what we say it has been different people all along
i find that weird when the nancys are having to turn against one another who do you think will get through
would be nancy
take you very much
and you'll be in something andrew
lloyd webber almost promised you
sunshine coming through for many
have been able to take my gloves off and dam finally warming up at about nine a m. threes gone and temperatures a couple of degrees above freezing one or two isolated showers ramming in off the north sea coast here's more cloud but generally speaking fine and predominantly sunni the further
south the west to come up again
how often do you guys have sex
miranda please
she is three expect she doesn't know what it means and forty one and i don't know what it means
but she keeps repeating everything
if i had known girl talk was going to be unlocked and i wouldn't have flown three thousand miles
we can topic does don't use that word
how often do
i would use every graham in my box
we get it you love to colour
and in the last few years i have been pretty much living in london l. did two shows in the west end and i did a film
longer been on television our audience base has actually grown it has gone global we were a half hour show on a cable network the most viewers we ever had was about seven million but in the four years it has gone global
were you reluctant to go back to samantha a lot happened to you four years ago for us to be wet through a divorce then your dad was diagnosed with a dimension was there are bits of you that thought you didn't want to go back there
there are times in your life when you needed time out i needed time out l. also feel that after seven years of intense work not just in front of the camera but also promoting the show we all needed time at we didn't have a script or a budget nobody had a contract it came around at exactly the perfect moment our audience basis so big now and in those four years we had more stories to tell the girls are now in their forties
but we don't talk about that
exactly fostered that is for the girlfriend and if you did hear it you would turn blue
can we change the subject
good morning
of the four it is fair to say i think that you are the men's favourite for reasons i can't imagine why you get that feedback
i do the thing about samantha is she is very much like a man or how one man would like to have it which is sex
nowadays people expect us because we play best friends to hang out afterwards but after nineteen hour day even my gorgeous twenty nine year old boyfriend does not look appealing
i just want to sleep and and does because she worked together it does not mean you can be working
is there going to be a sequel everybody wants to know everybody was coming out of the screening and asking them the next one was happening
a lot of paperwork to be done
kim cattrall
it has been an absolute joy to have you
cried nice to see you what's he called i can't remember the name
at the show gardens all morning they are beautiful we are going to talk about one that's very special and personal because it's dedicated to the memory of the late great george harrison i'm very pleased to say that olivia his widow and the designer of the garden with are with us olivia you used to come here together and lots of people don't realise how much gardening meant to george tell us about that
he really started gardening restoring a garden in nineteen seventy he was well into it for half of his life
you set quite a trend for the beatles coming to chelsea didn't you
perhaps i think we probably d. he love today here it was a great way he always got new ideas and discovered new plants we'd bump into friends and it became an annual thing for us frbgts just like the rest of us
yvonne you've designed the garden
for george harrison it's one of
colourful garden here tem us about the ideas
it's divided into four areas one earthy areas and one spiritual we have shown each area with the right planting in the boyhood area there is a vegetable patch apparently his father had an allotment
that's right
quite a responsibility for you to create someone's life in flowers and also to have their wife looking over your shoulder
olivia was a central part of it we worked on lots of the details together so it was no she was
i'm really happy i know any garden anyone who made the effort to make a garden he approved of l. think he would have loved this we used his favourite plants we tried to capture some of the colour of his life you know l. think yvonne did a good job with that
can for george and hopefully everyone will enjoy it
thank you both very much indeed good luck if you want to see their garden i'm sure it's going to feature in the b. b. c.'s coverage of chelsea throughout the next few days coverage continues on the news channel here on the b. b. c. of chelsea of course we have alan tichmarsh
really well hope she is watching l. haven't told her i'm on this morning she'll be annoyed
the neighbour will knock on the door and tell her we have been humming your tunes for the past twenty four hours
show me some mercy
i don't think it's very good actually i think it's brilliant her follow up to the single mercy is called warwick avenue hopefully your mum has switched on by now let's listen to the new song first
you know
good question london transport
is it based on personal experience of yours that first time i saw you was on jools holland where did he find you
that felt like really like quite
what i really like is the album is retro it takes me back to a year or two you know particularly like mercy you can't help but dot mashed potato were you aiming for that
i never planned anything l. never had a vision all i wanted was to make an honest record l. like kind of organic or kest ral nostalgic sounds i think they seem to haunt me it unfoldled that way we did a lot of songs over three years nobody knew about me you know there was no rush to make the record janet lee and i made the record together she a and amp red the whole thing there was no rush we picked our ten favourite songs and here we have it
how did she find you then i'm interested how this started you were squirreled away for three years janet kept you back while you were writing things how did she find up at the beginning where
did you start i i did many things through my teenage years i was kind of dangerously ambitious i believed that i could achieve anything i wanted l. learned the hard way l. got to about eighteen and i thought i didn't really want to do it any more l. l. thought i couldn't fight music was so painful and it shouldn't have been painful so i just became a singer she heard me singing on demos she encouraged me to write
you've been venturing into america and they like you there looking at a song like mercy not surprising because that's very american isn't it very soulful
maybe it is but i no you know one of the most amazing achievements is that i'm crossing over into the hip hop scene i know a girl from wales this doesn't happen very often a guy called the game has done a remix of mercy
we're hearing it at the moment
don't you want to do that
i know what you mean
people like algreen are some of your influences as well
which is dusty springfield which is an honour isn't it
in the beginning i was like wow this amazing lady shae chiefed so much over so many years i'm just starting out it's taking a life of its own we're in the same section of the dictionary type thing you know really i can only do what i'm meant to do it's not my intention

er half past two
well done tamba thank you ooh but what's this underneath the clock it's a bowl of porridge
ah hmmmm ha ha ha
and today's story is called what's it called the magic porridge pot there once was a girl with a rumbly tum who lived in a house with her grumbly mum mum was in a very bad mood i'm hungry dear
i need some food so off went the girl her name was dee
to try and find some tasty tea she went out into the little garden to find some fruit or a little root
hello said a voice i beg your pardon said dee
and she turned around and saw a lady on the ground
i'm so very thirsty dee my dear would you be so kind as to get me some water would you mind
i want you to have a gift from me it's something you'll like a lot it's a marvellous magical porridge pot
dee looked and suddenly saw a pot that was not there before
be sure you take this great pot home then recite this little poem cook magic porridge pot cook then in the pot take a look take a spoon start to forage in the pot you'll find some porridge when you've had your porridgy fill when you want the pot to be still be sure to say this bippety bop stop magic porridge pot stop
dee took the pot home and said the poem
cook magic porridge pot cook
and fiddle dee dee had porridge for tea
show me how it works said mum i've still a terribly rumbly tum cook magic porridge pot cook little dee said
her mum took a peek then scratched her head masses of porridge began to appear mum was so happy she shed a tear oh ho ho
stop magic porridge pot stop said dee now mum why not have some porridge with me
dee felt so full she couldn't sit down so she went for a wander around the town mum however was feeling greedy
it's my tum you see i'm feeling needy cook magic porridge pot cook mum cried
and oodles more porridge now she spied
that's enough now foolish mum thought that's enough pot pot you ought to stop making porridge for me i've enough now for breakfast lunch and tea
but the porridge pot kept on casting its magic
oh no said mum oh no this is tragic what can i do what can i say to make the porridge go away
uh oh she thought we're in terrible trouble
she saw the porridge climbed to a tower top and said stop magic porridge pot stoooooop and the town went quiet the pot was still no more porridge began to spill houses were covered in the lumpy food and no one was in a very good mood then clever dee had a great idea she called out loud in a voice so clear
don't be sad listen to me now you can all have porridge for tea instead of peas or carrots or borage come and eat my tasty porridge
and the town's folk laughed and gave great cheer yay hurray
we've enough porridge here to last all year hurray
hurray

space walking high up in the sky space walking this is how it feels to fly the earth looks very small and far closer to the evening stars space walking tonight
welcome to to buy or not to buy we're putting on our thinking caps to help a physics student make a quantum leap into property owning
helped by the bank of mum and dad
finding the perfect property shouldn't cause friction
don't you wish it would just fall right out of the sky
are you all right it's dark i can't find the light switch
we should be travelling at the speed of light to find three properties
and giving our buyer the unique chance to try before they buy he said it not me
today's buyers are richard and julie goodall and their son simon
simon's been accepted at nottingham university for a physics course and is planning for student life
but simon doesn't have to worry about finding suitable digs because mum and dad are keen to become landlords
you see they have two more children alex and stephanie and they hope the property will pass on to them when they grow up
and if they don't go to nottingham university it's an investment simon's not the only clever clogs in the family
richard julie simon welcome every parent sooner or later sends their children off to university
great washing your hands of your children for four years but you're getting involved in it
whoosh who eventually has the final say on the property
simon what do you want i want some accommodation that's close to the university
easy accessibility a bit of a garden somewhere for my motorbike when i bring it up
what would you like him to have somewhere safe and secure a nice neighbourhood a prison perhaps locked up i'll have him back in seven years
also somewhere to get back from the pub easily mum i'm surprised you said that and not him
you're encouraging him now when i was at university my student accommodation was
it wasn't the cleanest of places or the nicest of places how realistic are we being in terms of keeping it clean the easier it is the better coventry isn't that far away so your mum could bring the hoover
this is just what i thought once a month he's going to say mum would you like to come up
mums are great they still do it let's talk about budgets
how much have you got to spend we were looking at the bracket of ninety to one hundred ten
one hundred twenty on the outside
my parents sent me out for a pint of milk when i came back they'd moved you are a lucky boy
we should get moving we'll try to find a nice selection of properties
see you later on this is a first for us parents buying their student son his first accommodation never happened in my day nor mine
in my day it was a house share with fifteen other people two tons of dirty washing and six rats wow
your mum must have been busy no the student house share i know your mum's lovely one hundred twenty grand is not a bad budget
fantastic both let's go shopping
nottingham is famous for its legend of robin hood and his merry men and its history of lace making
but it has lots more to offer than just cheap frills the city centre has a pub club or restaurant for every night of the year
simon's in the right place with good accessibility from buses and trams what more does he need and look at this majestic university built in acres of parkland if simon passes his exams he could be in there with thirty two thousand students
let's look at what their budget one hundred twenty thousand buys round the country
well what about this a three bedroom semi detached in carlisle with an l. shaped lounge wood effect laminate flooring and a tasteful kitchen
or you might like this three bedroom detached bungalow in a small village in wales it's got a generous lounge and a huge garden
or you might be tempted by this exceptional living space a one bedroom apartment in the city centre of newcastle the interior is contemporary with a bedroom feature fireplace
that was an interesting collection let's see what nottingham offers it's because of him that i've lost most of my hair the best plan of attack is to get on the streets
look at the properties and then call the estate agent that is the only way to achieve results as you will soon see
hi kris sorry wrong number i'm out searching for properties
when you can't find what you want it rubs you up the wrong way
it is hard work like trying to find a needle in a haystack can i have more needles please
i think this is the passageway it's a tad overgrown
hair loss hardly worked for me
no this is someone's back garden out out out
my name's dominic hi i'm diane i want a house for a student
i'm house hunting for a student
this one ah i like that close to the university
maybe two to three bedrooms it's still got to be first class not second best
do not judge us because we are sitting down we've worked so hard
like a couple of hound dogs well one i've contributed a little bit in a small way i found a spot near the oldest pub in england
what are the chances of stumbling across that and drinking soda water and blackcurrant juice
hardly rock and rollers are we it keeps the mind focused and sharp
and we've done quite well let's start off with my property
let's start with my property number one a two bedroom end of terrace in beeston a magnet for students with a lovely conservatory
are you on their wavelength they did ask for three bedrooms don't worry yourself kristian
i've got a solution richard simon julie here's the house i found i believe it's absolutely perfect for a student i'll tell you why i'm so confident it's owned by a student close to the university off street parking somewhere for your motorbike julie you hold the purse strings first impressions it sounds very good and you richard
it looks a very nice property well looked after looks maintained
simon you've got to live there what do you think
looks a good size plenty of space off road parking looks good
our policy is honesty go in there and tell is what you think of it
your policy honesty that's a lie to start with you don't know the meaning of the word
dom are you ready for our first property lecture i've had a few of those
pleasant room nice isn't it it's a nice square shape
not too many little alcoves don't like the old fire can't go back boiler
quite a lot of work isn't it
i don't think you'd touch the decoration for the students
simon is being very quiet here
if my mum and dad were buying me a house i'd be over the moon where do i sign
ugh yellow and green yes oh that is so yellow the units are change the colour i think i'd be happy but it needs some paint nice size plenty of space
all you need is space enough to do this know what that is
opening the fridge no the toaster the sandwich maker
the pizza carton from the delivery
looks like some sort of makeshift for them to have their breakfast it would look like it could be it's not going to be used for ironing i don't know no
when i was a student i was a freak because you've always been one i ironed my clothes you ironed your underpants that's why you were a freak
this is a pleasant surprise a conservatory nice for a dining table you could sit out here and eat students don't dine you don't dine on a lager you drink a lager
and eat toast yeah
a couple of garden gnomes
what does he mean no idea nor me caught anything yet
a lot of wood panelling anyway
two minutes to rip it off no big deal a student could do it
this is all right a good size it certainly is isn't it it's quite a big room i'm not too keen on that wood panelling
student parties have a seventies theme
that's a good size ooh yeah
you won't be able to leave your stuff all over the floor
just chuck it all in like you do at home
if he's going to be a student he has to have stuff everywhere
oh goodness oh right gosh
yeah wood panelling again everywhere is matching same colour not probably our taste
do we no we're in the shade
smaller than the other room would you have fights
fights he owns the building he'd have the best room they're the landlords
i'll just take a peek up here oh yes this would be obviously a great storage area or a study area
all your textbooks all your course work computer spot on
all your colouring in books yeah
decent enough bathroom actually it's relatively nicely tiled
a bit out of date i don't like it too old fashioned it is old fashioned i agree
good job we're not showing them in your wardrobe yeah
has it got a shower students will only use a shower
i like students they like this programme we love them
we can wrap this up and go home we've got more convincing to do you're so negative let's talk about this house it's somewhere simon is going to stay then your next child is moving in it's almost a baton effect passing it on but at the end of the day it's an investment yes you want as much return as you can and to rent out the rooms to help pay for the upkeep you've only got two bedrooms nice study as well let's face fact students don't really need a living room like this
no here's what i'm thinking you could put in a partition wall here
you could turn this into another bedroom even a double room you haven't got a lounge then but they do want somewhere to chill out and open their takeaways
yeah but this house has the bonus of the full length conservatory no that's a big plus and it's a lovely size actually
put the telly out there and everything else you want and use that as your lounge more income
let's have division rivalry parents versus student son has he got a chance
none no they've got no faith in you
do you feel you've got a chance i don't know
one hundred eight one hundred seven yeah one hundred seven one hundred seven dead yeah
simon what do you think i think slightly less again
he's being precise isn't he that's quite interesting
still feel like you might have won yep you were spot on
i need to shake this hand unbelievable
it's on the market for one hundred four thousand nine hundred ninety five incredible beginner's luck he's thrown down the gauntlet dom they have no faith in you pull your socks up we're off to house number two congratulations he's academic if this property is the right choice for richard and julie they would have to remove the gas fire to convert the lounge to a bedroom to avoid any risk of carbon monoxide poisoning
here's my choice property two a newly decorated three bedroom mid terrace in lenton abbey it's so recently decorated the paint is hardly dry and only a stone's throw from the university right here we are at property number two which is my choice dominic's choice how many bedrooms
two slash three mine is three slash four which i think is better a lot more rental potential first impressions very nice nice size can literally see the university down the road
i like you richard gone off you julie looks nice and tidy that's where i give kristian credit it has been presented nicely you do pay for that he says you've got an extra bedroom but you've got a neighbour on both sides you've gone from semi detached to mid terrace you want somewhere safe to put your motorbike no problem through the porch through the living room make sure it doesn't drip in the hall can i have a word also you liked that conservatory nice
just go in and tell us what you think there's going to be a scrap
straight into the kitchen nice quite spacious it's a lovely kitchen
the layout is what they wanted
obviously just been done and not used by the look
it's so neutral it's inoffensive there's no colour to dislike
a big storage like a pantry you could make that into a bigger kitchen
what good is a big kitchen to a student pointless
you can get huge giant american style pizzas delivered you can open up even bigger lids
you like doing that windscreen wiper impression it's a pizza carton
nice big sized room i think you can smell paint
a house like this in good decorative order it takes nothing to keep it to that standard occasionally slop some paint on but my one at least you could expand and build on it
it's nice and square isn't it i smell paint
the old fireplace again i think they're on about the fire
not my favourite thing i'd replace that
obviously a new carpet plenty of space to sit around sit around and party
will they come out to the conservatory now they haven't got one
it's terrible to feel overconfident a new feeling for you yeah i'm feeling very content
the smallest of the bedrooms it's a bit small for renting out
he's thinking about his money what he'll get bank of mum and dad
easy thing again is if we converted the living room to a bedroom and just use this as a storeroom
if they rented out the lounge yes where will they watch telly
this is a better bedroom a nicer size but you need a desk or work area but it's got some nice storage space look how deep that is
normally a wardrobe is say deep and it's like that i promise you a bit like your trap
you could even possibly have the bed here
they didn't do this at yours
here we have the bathroom obviously quite small but like kristian says it's presented well but maybe not quite as big as the previous one
this bathroom is in much better decorative order than yours it's the size of a biscuit tin
this is a good size room yeah it'd be a main room
they haven't got any double beds
that is such a devious little trick what putting in single beds to make it look bigger she spotted it
it's all clean all tidy all painted the same colour
not like the one we saw earlier
the bathroom's a bit small the bedrooms not so well proportioned
i think we should get in there at the speed of light what is it one hundred eighty six thousand miles per second
looking at the back of the house what do you notice
there's no conservatory
i so wish kristian could hear this there isn't a conservatory but there is something that i want to point out when you look over there two skylights and over there four skylights look at this house the pitch is the height of the roof you've got a huge pitch on there you need a minimum of two metres to convert an attic into a room you could do that very easily and turn that into an office or study or if the price was right have a dormer extension put on it you'd need that to make it bigger and get a staircase put in there but there is potential with that pitch to go up into it
and if you use that as a bedroom another room could be a study bang on it could be
so you've seen the house i want to talk about area and location you can make an observational assessment not a bad neighbourhood
no it looks nice it's quiet you feel at ease with the area
yeah and the university's a stone's throw away just lurking behind those trees i think he'll love it here it is a good area so let's talk about money let's do that
well it's guess the price but mum and dad left eating humble pie are you still feeling confident no
yes dad is you think you'll win this yes
shall we throw the ball now into simon's court and get him to guess first
now for the wild card this three bedroom semi detached in stapleford provides all the space a couple of students would need it's in a quiet setting
and the property has a real family feel here is property number three the joint choice the wild card a very smart property however the reason it's our wild card is the location we're in stapleford further away from the university than you would like but we couldn't resist stapleford is the epicentre for scientific endeavour one of dominic's scientific heroes who comes from this area here has made a life changing invention
they're not thinking big enough no they're not
it's a modern day einstein a darwin her name is doctor joanne morgan let me tell you what she invented using the forces of gravity and physics she has reinvented the bra she came up with a model that is strapless and backless she is a bachelor boy's hero and she came from stapleford will wonders never cease doesn't that inspire you yeah it inspires me could be your claim to fame exactly
think what she could do for the rest of lingerie wonders never cease
dom all that stuff is that true about joanne morgan yeah gospel honestly yeah yeah cross your heart don't question me support me here
this is nice isn't it wow can you imagine students in here
might be too nice for students
they've done well here totally different isn't it
this doesn't feel studenty it's a nice solid family home
must have been like a chimney breast they've made a shelf from interesting
they should get doctor joanne morgan round
big kids having fun do you know what you make a lot more sense in that position
nice kitchen it's a bit compact isn't it
is that a polite way of saying small as long as everything's in there all the white goods
there's nothing to moan about
you've got a serving hatch there i didn't notice that on that side students could line their drinks up
you do need space for the beer the wine and the vodka essential student accessories
no it's tequila with students and cider
the hallway's nice good banister painted up well that's an odd observation
never heard that before
a bathroom this has been done out really well look at the lights in the ceiling
it's almost like someone's gone with a shotgun they're peppered
it's not a white suite but it's a neutral colour it's not one that would put people off too much
students can move in and then at the end sell it back on to a family
that's why dad is making those comments thinking about the future this could be a good property sound investments
it's obviously a child's bedroom a good sized bedroom simon for a student it would let all right wouldn't it
they've got to look for rental potential
it would have to be a single bed in here wouldn't it students don't need a double bed no if we were selling it on you could quite easily fit a double bed in here
they should say bunk beds bottom or top we'll rent out the other
it's a good size and square
this is a nice bedroom this must be the master bedroom how would this suit you your room
not only lilac walls lilac carpet
it might be kristian's colour might need to redecorate it
every time there's a flamboyant room colour i get accused of it
this is obviously the smaller of the bedrooms
let's be honest kris they like the house but not enough to actually choose this one
it's whether the area is accessible to nottingham would students come this far out but we could let it to families yeah and it would sell on probably easier
we don't know where we stand no point in swinging around like orang utans let's get in would you agree that of the three houses this one is the best presented certainly it's lovely you started to fall in love with it but i sensed that simon didn't think it was the right one
if it was for ourselves this would be the one we would go for but it's not for us
he's got a one twenty five c. c. motorbike which he's worried about he wants to look after it this pathway is not blatantly obvious but it's got a garage you can't put a car in there because there's no access but it's got power it's got lights and it's got a dirty great big suzuki motorcycle in there it just goes to show how practical a garage it is
does this come with it no well they'd probably throw it in
right simon come out here all very nice again more manicured than other gardens the space of the house better worse
it's a lot bigger the bedroom's quite small but the feel to the house is quite big it's still a bit too far away
it was more of their own idea they wanted an investment rather than spending it on somewhere else
so it's not you being lovely making them dinner
no not really they're just offering you all their cash
see if you can get any more cash from them because this has potential to be extended look along here this is one of the only houses in this street that hasn't been extended you can go single storey or both for a larger kitchen larger lounge separating off the dining room and lounge and maybe get a bigger bedroom upstairs
yeah more importantly it's the third guess the price time you've done so well yeah
i think your parents are amazed yeah of course they have no idea how you've been doing it there's the property details have a look thank you finished i have pass them back let's see if you get it right a third time
as future landlords richard and julie have to bear in mind that the property is covered by strict new housing regulations for houses in multiple occupation
julie has that look embarrassment i think
that's an odd figure to go to just under twenty two grand and you could put an offer in and get it down to your budget his guess is a bit odd round figure yeah feeling lucky confident
i'm hoping pulled one back yes well done spot on to the pound
unbelievable i don't believe this how do you he's a genius have we been set up i think so no we wouldn't do that that's got to be beginner's luck three times though
we need a decision about which property you'd like to test drive to help that decision here are all three properties take this away deliberate i'll give it to simon he seems to have the biggest brain guide your parents be gentle we know how it works commiserations buy them a coffee cheerio off you go here's a quick recap on the three properties
my choice was this two bed semi in beeston it has everything simon could want a good bedroom and a good sized lounge that could easily be turned into a third bedroom to rent out
hold on tiger what about this mid terrace in lenton abbey it has three bedrooms already and has been sympathetically decorated with space for a conservatory
hang on a second let's not forget the wild card this three bed semi it has all the comforts students leave behind and a dining room and fantastic garden
but it is further away will that count against it
which property will be the answer
yes julie and it's a square room what do you reckon to the kitchen
not keen on the colour
the tiles will put them off
would you make it a dining room i reckon yeah a dining room
hold your horses digby
i quite liked this presentation is of paramount importance dom the bathroom was very small small wasn't it
it's curtains down for you digby
a bit too small all the bedrooms
i showed them three decent sized bedrooms oh throw the towel in kristian
very well presented oh they seem to like this one nice dining areas as well good for making into a bedroom
wouldn't need to do anything to it
which one are they going to choose i am completely confused
that's because you're stupid kris let me help you yours is a non starter
dom's kristian's or wild card
i am so pleased that you chose my property over the other two but in particular over kristian's it's wiped that smug smile off his face no it's still there unfortunately what did it for you i think how close it was to the university that did it
simon was happy with it location yeah what about you mum
it wasn't bad repair we could see the improvements we could do to sell it on later on to improve the property
simon the position's very good
very easy access for the uni nice size quite a nice area
i made a fundamental mistake in giving you lots of bedrooms how stupid am i we'll have to move on certainly before we let you in
our surveyor gave it the once over on your behalf he has found a couple of things to discuss
it's not a legally binding survey if buying get a full structural survey carried out however if you want to convert that attic you'll need building regs he thinks it'll be no problem but you will need a fixed ladder down from the loft enclose that put a fire door at the bottom and have provisions for a fire escape then turn it into a bedroom
something which might be more serious is if you stand back from it and line yourself up with the gable wall it's not quite vertical it's actually bowing in the centre he believes hopefully it's just isolated settlement but we'd recommend it gets looked at that's it test drive time
they're very quiet dom i know it's the effect we have on people
i expect tumbleweed now i'll get some for you
go and make some noise in the house and we'll talk to you later on
always a good idea to check out the area
here's simon's buddies to help out with the test drive one can only imagine what will ensue
you know kris i do predict a riot i hope the foundations can cope what on earth are they up to
i could get used to this richard's warming to student life
they don't need an extra bedroom he's found a spot on the floor
i don't like this it's scaring me oh behave
there won't be much house to buy
kristian boys will be boys it is a perfect student house
and it seems this property has made a splash will our buyers splash out i have to say it's been emotional i'm drained i've barely got anything left to give but we're at the final hurdle are you still keen on it yes you like it yes nice property
yeah you'd look after it well
he's got to be careful what he says no one's committing completely see it when if he's lived here let's get down to the meat of the bone here's what we want to know will you barter or scarper
well i think we might do a bit more investigation into the area first but may put in an offer
but if you do end up buying it keep in touch with us yes will do
keep us up to date with what's going on we wish you the best of luck take care bye you know kris he's about to get that house bought for him his first ever house and we found it i feel honoured so do i i bet millions out there want our help if you do don't hesitate to get in touch eh
know what i'm still stunned about he's being bought a house and he's so nonchalant about it
blase yes what was the last present your parents bought you
the joan collins book of beauty no what about you brush and comb set oh no what about for your birthday even worse i got a bodybuilding kit
ever use it relentlessly what about you my parents got me a holiday to siberia
really a return

growing up's good because you get more friendly with the girls cos they start to talk to you i feel a bit differently around boys when i was in primary i'd play about with them easily now i'm a little bit nervous about them especially when i fancy them when you fancy someone you change your behaviour a lot to get noticed
what happens when you go out with someone when you fancy them when you think of someone as a boyfriend or girlfriend
this is a change that happens at puberty
when you fancy someone your heart beats and you're like wow when you fancy someone it feels strange cos you don't know whether to go and ask them or talk to them you write all over your folder that you love him and all your pals are like ask him out you just can't explain it it's like excitement or fear
you can have very strong emotional feelings about a range of people pop stars teachers film stars people of the same sex and people of the opposite sex
a crush on a pop star all people have that emma from the spice girls we saw romeo and juliet suddenly leonardo di caprio was everything britney spears at the moment i really like her i've got pictures everyone has that even though there's no chance it's normal
we may imagine being married to our favourite pop star but it's not likely to happen we tend go out with someone closer to home closer to our own age
how do they get together it can be difficult getting someone to notice or go out with you there are a whole range of methods you can use some are more successful than others
you're pathetic
that was very popular when i was at primary does flicking things at people attract their attention
it'll get the wrong attention not the right attention if you want to go out with someone if someone was trying to get my attention by flicking a piece of paper i'd get the impression they hated me
this
is your name john watson might be well my mate fancies you will you go out with her
might do
suit yourself
has anyone ever done that does it work
it does work cos i've asked one of my mates to ask a girl out and a girl's mate's asked me out it's a pretty decent method i think it worked for me i got my friends to ask this boy out and he said yes so i was going out with him
do you think if you were to ask them yourself they might say no or are you scared they might say no
it's better to use a friend if they say no your friend can tell you it's better than having it in front of you it might backfire if you get your friends to ask someone out and they say no everyone's gonna know they said no so you might feel a bit humiliated by it
what about the fact he was asked in front of his friend i feel that
he felt a bit embarrassed i wouldn't like to be in front of my friends while someone was sent to tell me that someone likes me
let's see another one
all right all right waiting for your mate yeah
chelle's getting a telling off she forgot her p. e. kit again oh
she's coming chelle over here we're gonna be late
yeah see ya later
do you think there was progress there
and finally
all right fatty
shut it moron if brains were braces you'd have to wear a belt i know
is it a good idea to insult people if you want them to like you that way was safe it can't backfire
what you say can be taken as a joke it can be a bad idea being nasty cos it could give the wrong impression that you want to hurt them and be violent with them you don't have to use violence verbal or physical to talk to someone he could speak nicely saying hi i really like you would you like to go to the cinema or something along that line once you've talked to one boy it gets easier i'll talk to them to get a bit close to them and find out if they like me i'd take him to one side i wouldn't do it in front of anyone i'd say i've liked you a long time will you go out with me i'd make it personal and it's just you by yourself and be honest i've got a girlfriend at the moment and somebody asked her out for me then i had to go up to her again and ask her it wasn't that bad
the best method seems to be talking to someone and being straight we've had a letter from someone who really fancies a girl in their class and she's not interested what if the other person doesn't want to know there's nothing you can do
go on to someone else
they don't fancy you has that happened to any of you yeah
it happens to everyone the important thing to remember is not everyone's ready to have a relationship don't be pressurised by friends and family haven't you got a girlfriend yet oh look it's your little girlfriend if you ask him out we could go as a foursome haven't you got a girlfriend yet ee you make a lovely couple
some people think everyone has to have a boyfriend or girlfriend you're not normal if you don't you might end up pretending
hello i got another letter from jamie another one he must write every day it must be love let's see
well
when's he coming to see you i don't know he's phoning me tonight can't wait to meet him
i don't know when he'll get here he lives in london you'd be better with someone from here i'm happy
why do people get themselves into that situation it's silly
pretending you've got a boyfriend is just stupid you may be lonely but there's other things to do with your friends than pretend you've got a boyfriend what happens if your friends find out you've been lying to them you could end up with no friends so there's no point in doing it
there is no rule that says you have to have a boyfriend or girlfriend
your grandparents say you're very attractive i bet you've got lots of boyfriends you think oh god no my nan goes have you got a girlfriend i don't really want one yet cos i like having my girlie friends around my friends have all got girlfriends they go do you like this girl i go when i want a girlfriend i'll tell you my friends just pick somebody they don't love them or anything it's just like let's get a girlfriend they see somebody else then dump that girlfriend that's not fair
but at some point a lot of people do want to have a boyfriend or a girlfriend what makes a good one
it's somebody you can talk to in a different way to your friends a good sense of humour good looks and very kind and caring a sense of humour does matter someone who likes you not for your clothes but for who you are inside nobody who makes fun of you and is horrible in front of their mates
at the boyfriend or girlfriend shop what would you want
something sporty ah he loves darts what about a footballer
i'm not having much luck there's a dance on friday you've left it late i know could i see him absolutely there beggars can't be choosers i suppose he'll do excellent shall i wrap him for you you'd better
will she enjoy being with that boyfriend ruby no
he's got none of the qualities she wanted she's settling for less than her ideal the problem here was all the questions she asked were about looks and how she might want to impress someone with a boyfriend he might have a good personality she should've asked is he funny because that's what makes relationships work oh hello again dear hello i'm not complaining but the last time i was here say no more bit of a disappointment well if i tell you what i want perhaps it'd be more suitable uh huh what exactly are you looking for blond hair blue eyes fit good dancer uh huh what about mike he's not blond but he's got blue eyes he's older than you but intelligent dresses smart but casual only swears when he's in pain quite fit but not exactly a body builder
sounds good could i see him he's second from the left very nice excellent
shall i wrap him for you no i'll take him as he is thanks
should she have turned him down cos he wasn't exactly what she wanted
she'll never get exactly what she wants that guy was interesting and nice and had some of the qualities she wanted she'll probably get on with him
is this situation realistic yeah
how should you behave with a boyfriend or girlfriend you've got to support and comfort each other
and be able to talk to each other open yourself to each other not keep everything inside you don't have to be all clingy you can still be with your friends generally treating them as well as you can respect is a huge point in a relationship when you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend there are unspoken rules you follow like mutual respect you don't insult them behind their back or to their face you don't tell their secrets to everyone because they're secrets they've told in confidence you're entitled to feel good about your relationship if you don't it's not working
see if you can spot anyone breaking rules here
she stuffs tissues down her bra
no she does
they don't their own songs they get ugly gadges to sing them and put pretty boys on the video
at least you can understand what they're singing
maybe he's not the right guy for you he's a tube right enough not bad looking but no but he's stupid he thinks eastenders is a documentary not many are much in the brains department i don't know what you want half the time maybe i want a boyfriend who likes to be with me
wants to do the same things i do what ice skating no chance i've seen kevin harrower at the skating a few times he's good at it too and he's in my art class
kevin harrower he he's nice
he always talks to me about stuff
he's too old for you anyway what about me what about you if you think kevin harrower fancies you you're dafter than you look so i look daft you will wait and see
what do we think about those sketches any rules being broken
the first one i saw was secrets being told behind backs i think that's very wrong it ain't nice i don't think there's any respect for each other's interests there were a lot of insults they were quite nasty to each other
one of the girls was going on about someone else she liked to her boyfriend
she was trying to make her boyfriend jealous to her so it's not good
at the end of the day do you really like this person or are they just someone to go out with you don't have to have a boyfriend or girlfriend it's only right when it's something you want to do not something your friends want
what do you like about them do you enjoy spending time with them
it's a two way thing what do they expect and how can you be a good boyfriend or girlfriend
i've made it i'm a superhero i've learned loads of stuff about me about other people and about words did you learn while i was saving josie and peter from victor virus maybe it's time you did a bit of work i can't do everything i have a list somewhere ah here these are things berlie uses when she writes a story she used them all when writing my story what you need when writing a story is lots of different kinds of words nouns verbs adjectives adverbs be careful not to get these two mixed up adjectives and adverbs are both describing words but are different adjectives tell you what things are like blue fast clever remind you of anyone adverbs describe how things are done quickly carefully clumsily oh adverbs are easy to spot because most end in ly as lord hamish found out when he tried to fly over the waterfall how many adverbs can you spot here there are seven
my name is lord hamish wwwohhh what's the matter i want to fly over the waterfall i used to be able to if only i could remember the word for it it's an ly word
merrily try sadly fly bravely or grumpily suits him slowly hurriedly
did you spot them remember the adverb that worked it was
easily it was on the tip of my tongue all the time
ah the green glen you get through a lot of describing words when you're writing a story especially when the scenes are so different i mean take this place the castle of gloom how would you describe it don't say gloomy
come and hang from these spikes
what did you think i found good ones how about what about this place can you find words to describe this
this way
or this ahh any ideas
there you are a bit of help at last
you need a barrelful of adjectives to describe those good job i've got one you can use it to describe people like simon how would you describe him and miss wordsworth what do you think my favourite word for miss wordsworth is kind or urggghhh him i have lots of adjectives to describe him what would you suggest nasty for a start then evil wicked monstrous fiendish hateful repulsive oh i'm sorry i got carried away all these words mean roughly the same thing that means we can keep them in the synonym bin synonyms different words that mean the same remember when i lay helpless in peter's bag miss wordsworth and the children used synonyms to help me out list the synonyms in this scene
come on energy force vigour look at him
it's working yeesss
ha ha zip zap zee
yes come on
you don't bury me did you get them all another thing that berlie used in the story was words that rhyme and words that don't rhyme remember the rhyme chime chamber
where are we it's like a hall a place for a ball
i've seen them dance and all let's go we're trapped help they won't hear us through these stones we'll die
two heaps of bones hey i talked in rhyme you do it all the time
we're going mad
it's not that bad
help i'm zzaap we're trapped we keep speaking verse i know there's nothing worse
find the time to end the rhyme it won't take much detection you'll find it in your reflection
reflection what can you see peter i've got it can you remember the word that didn't have a rhyme a word that rhymes with mirror birror hirror tirror there isn't one
time's up victor virus has scored nineteen and zzaap has scored twenty
you see every story is a journey sometimes smooth sometimes bumpy that's what makes an adventure really worth reading remember josie and peter they didn't like each other much
why do i have to play with her
but by the end they were getting on famously
simon your game was brilliant
you were really good at it you too
so how did that happen they must have learnt something about each other during the story what do you think they learnt it's like simon and miss wordsworth they didn't start off well either
why is there a problem with peter and josie no no problem
hands up who thinks simon should have told miss wordsworth what was happening straight away one two three should she have told simon she'd messed with his game so why didn't they maybe they didn't want to admit they'd made a mistake or thought it wasn't that important in the end they got into such a mess they had to tell the truth
miss wordsworth simon
i've got something to tell you me too you first
like josie and peter they learnt that two heads were better than one right heads
left right left right
well maybe not always but you see what i'm saying the characters got in difficult situations and what they did could make it better or worse in the end it worked out fine not for victor but for me and josie and peter and miss wordsworth and frances and simon of course uh they couldn't have done it without me but then i was the hero and that's what heroes are for to make sure that the goodies win ah i'd better get back to my corner
i can't wait to tell you zzaap i know that tone of voice i've got this great idea for a story
it's a really friendly community it feels like a little village really a village within a city which i absolutely love
on evenings like this we sometimes take our evening dinner over to the park table and bench and end up with our neighbours around the table in the park eating it it's really nice
it'll be really hard to leave we love this house but we're relocating to lancashire so we have to sell
you have to sell so you've got kind of a lifestyle dream have you to kind of leave the coast down here and head up north
we've had a great time here but we came to a point in our lives where we wanted to change completely we did
so what is it about your lifestyle that you want to improve
i guess getting more time together as a family with the children we both work in really stressful jobs that end up with us working really long hours and we want to reclaim back a bit of our lives by just getting a bit more balance
we'd like to get about four hundred sixty four hundred sixty five for it which will enable us not only to buy a new family home in lancashire but to put some capital into a new business cos we'd really like to be self employed as well
all right thank you i'll see you later
one or two a year probably come on in that road
now if that's the case what about prices
rare properties generally do achieve a little bit more because you have a market for them so i reckon a price around four hundred fifty would be achievable on that property
i reckon we could get about twenty through the door
who is good with the paint brush
derek that would be my role i think
we build a lot of loft conversions in houses round here where people are quite happy to stay in the area they like their house perhaps their kids are at schools that are quite good but they need more space and for sort of twenty two twenty three thousand they can get another room in their house without having to you know obviously without having to move
my research tells me that an extra bedroom could add up to thirty thousand to the value of a property on this street that would pay for a conversion and then some so with our expert's plans and drawings i'll ram home the untapped advantage in the whiting's loft while i've been busy at the top of the house it's all hands to the pump downstairs
you start at the bottom i'll start at the top
with three days until our open house the kids have been roped in to help clean their bedrooms and derek is hard at work with the paintbrush and i've got one more trick up my sleeve to hopefully make those buyers bid big the whiting family home is truly in a dreamy location with so many amenities right on their doorstep i'm obliged to make sure that every potential buyer that walks through that front door is aware how good it is around here and what a fantastic property that is and i'm going to do that by serving up all the relevant information in a property profile and handing it out to every buyer your property profile needs to answer every question about your house and locality because with an open house you'll be inundated with buyers in a very short space of time make sure you include photographs of all the rooms guarantees for any work done and information about the bidding process and don't forget to sell your area include details of transport links schools and even menus from local restaurants while the whitings work on the property profile pack estate agent shaun is busy on the phone drumming up potential buyers
i think it's probably going to be between ten and five o'clock
little bit nervous don't tell me that
i don't want to hear that you're nervous
all these people coming along are we going to get any offers
well i have foolishly put all my trust and faith in one man that man being you and i want you to say yes i think we will do you think so
yeah it's a great house great location i think we'll get some offers in
you've been getting people hyped up about this has there been a lot of interest or not
we've focussed on people that are serious about buying in this area and we've got about twenty two people coming along today
you are a demi god you're brilliant i love that twenty two potential buyers fingers crossed so this is it eager buyers are waiting in the wings the house is ready to take centre stage and i'm talking last minute selling strategies with derek and fiona what's your tactic have you got a game plan yet
haven't really thought about that we'd better think quickly
you haven't got very long we need to think about this
yes don't be modest
i know modesty's normally a lovely thing but i think be shameless be absolutely shameless
yeah so it feels the most personal room that we've put our stamp on
and the location for me the park and the community and those sorts of things right i'm looking forward to it looking forward to seeing who turns up and what they think of it but i'm really worried in case nobody wants to buy it
and we're off
hello our estate agent shaun has done a great job
do you know if you can get an en suite up there yes
one party is particularly interested and gives derek and fiona a real grilling in the kitchen
how long have you been living here about nine and a half years have you got somewhere to go to
we're relocating up to the north of england and we're going to go and live with relatives for a while so we're not buying yet so we won't be in an onward chain
fiona's doing a great job with potential buyers my sales technique however is proving less successful for me one of the most exciting things is the potential here begging screaming to be converted into the attic space they've had a quote given we've seen the quote twenty grand
quite reasonable it's not bad is it
thank you good bye thank you thank you
no worries thanks a lot bye bye bye bye thank you thank you very much my goodness this is extraordinary
we liked it
yeah i thought it was really nice
and he liked it being opposite the park yeah and it's a nice it's a nice road
i thought it was a beautiful house and nicely presented
so our open house has generated plenty of interest but will anyone be making a bid
cos i'm selling at the moment and i haven't got an offer i'm not in a great position
i don't think we'll be making a bid but i'm sure someone will snap this up because it's a beautiful house
can't be long now can't be long
i've actually got butterflies in my stomach
since any bids are going through shaun the agent fiona and derek won't even know if anyone's made an offer until after the deadline has passed you'll never guess what's just happened what no news yet at all
but i quickly regret that little gag because the lack of news is becoming too much to bear for all of us meanwhile mercifully potential buyers are sending in bids
personally i don't even think four hundred sixty will secure it because it's immaculate
it's the five p. m. deadline time to find out whether the massive gamble fiona and derek have made has paid off
do you think he's actually coming back
here's the two envelopes for you brilliant
oh i wonder how kristian derek and fiona
we have had six bids
wow six six bids
wow right but then we have a very interesting situation
hoping for four hundred sixty five
four hundred sixty five that was the very top wasn't it
brilliant extraordinary fantastic
well i can see smiles which is a good thing it's a good thing right have you made a decision
yes we have which offer are you going to go for we're going to go for the cash buyer
that's right decision well made
i will now call that buyer are you ready for this it's a foreign number no i'm only kidding um right it's ringing it's ringing
andrew hello it's kristian here
hi i am calling to say that we've had a look at the bids
and um we'd be very pleased to accept your offer
we got the house come on then
guys it was an absolute pleasure pleasure to meet you thank you so a bid has been accepted and now it's down to the vendor and their estate agent to clinch the sale it's been a fantastically successful open house and all being well the whiting's dream location to the north is just around the corner the question is can we do it again well to find out join us next time on open house

the castle that once dominated the landscape here fell into disrepair in the sixteen hundreds but much of the stone was used to build this gateway it also contributed to the building of westminster abbey and saint paul's cathedral so let's hope that today we can build a fantastic result when our precious antiques go under the hammer at auction coming up on today's cash in the attic what has this woman's husband done to deserve this
he's got to suffer more before i give in
and while i'm doing my best to be accommodating the field shelter i mean the tractor i mean the field shelter anyway things only get worse
if you send your secretary up the road to buy me a present and she comes back with black underwear you'll be wearing it
but will all be forgiven when we get to auction
at five hundred sixty
what reserve have you put on it
don't ask me i can't remember
find out more when we see today's collectibles go under the hammer i'm on my way to meet a couple who love a challenge they've called in the cash in the attic team to help them raise some much needed funds for a new project it's an active life for horse lovers malcolm and anne stevens who run an equestrian farm in the village of charlwood in surrey malcolm deals with the maintenance of the livery yard and manages to fit in work as a director of a construction company while anne tends to the eight horses they have stabled here as well as looking after a little band of chickens but it's not cheap running the yard so they need all the help they can get to find hidden treasures that will raise enough cash to make life that little bit easier down on the farm morning jonty hi lorne how are you
what have we got in store today
as you can see we're on a very nice farm but it is on the large side i hope you're ready to muck in you know me
i always come prepared
thank goodness for that come on trust jonty to have posh green wellies i go in search of anne and malcolm but that's easier said than done good morning it's taken me ages to find you you've got loads of outbuildings
yes and you're hard at work absolutely
i guess you haven't called cash in the attic in to help bal the straw have you
do you want to give us a hand if you'd like to
i understand you've got some antiques to sell
all the collectibles we've acquired and inherited from family are in boxes and they will probably never come out
so is it all inherited no i used to collect things years ago
in his previous life
in my previous life as we call it before i became a mad farmer
so if you're happy to sell them and raise some money have you any idea how much and what you want to spend it on
we've narrowed it down to two things that we're in slight a dispute about
anne would like a field shelter for the horses and i would like a front loader on the little chinese tractor that we hand built two years ago
men never give up gadgets do they
no let's be honest we always want toys to play with toys for the boys
they both sound quite expensive so how much money are you looking to raise
if we could get about two thousand five hundred that would put us on the right track
it'd be fantastic
then we could argue about what to spend it on
hi guys this little collection amazing isn't it they're all gossware which is all this amazing little decorative tourist pieces do you understand why they became so popular
it was because people used to go on day trips and they'd buy one of these pieces of goss with where they'd been
so what sort of value are we talking about
looking at this whole collection here we're looking at eighty to one hundred twenty that ball park
if they can all go to auction and make that sort of money i'll be very happy we'll decide who's spending that later let's see what else we can find
i'm happy to let the goss go it's something i've had for a long time but time to move on
with the potential eighty for the farm fund that's a wise decision and means we're off to a respectable start but we've a long way to go so let's not jump the gun and jonty's keen expert eye tracks down another lucrative find stowed safely away
malcolm look
ah yes one of my flintlock pistols
is it have you got a collection
well not a collection but that's a nice one isn't it
beautiful what possessed you to want to buy a pistol like this
ah well forty years ago when i was a young man i happened to see this and i thought what a beautiful piece of equipment it was
were you told anything about it
other than it was an holster pistol which would've been used by gentlemen on horseback i believe it's english
it's a flintlock pistol so the name suggests clearly what it's all about so the flint strikes a small amount of powder in there and out comes your shot at the other end they started making these flintlock pistols in the sixteen hundreds but this isn't sixteen hundreds and it's not english oh have a look at this brass butt end does that not look like a minaret
it does which gives a clue as to where it's from
it's from the ottoman empire so it's turkish
right
this was made for the ottoman empire if you look at the engraving it really is fine detail everything about this is hand made so certainly the ottoman empire with their mass expansion every adult male had to have something like this so date wise i'm afraid it's not from the sixteen hundreds it's more like early eighteenth century and value today in the market ball park one hundred one hundred fifty at auction
right
they have to be in very good order before you get huge sums of money for them how do you feel about that
yes disappointed obviously
are you happy to put it in the sale erm
it'll more than likely go in i was a little surprised it was turkish i did have some suspicions about it though
because this flintlock pistol is for decorative purposes only and never fired it's exempt from a gun licence but it's still wise to keep it locked away the same goes for these swords that malcolm keeps secured in his office which include a light cavalry sabre he thinks was used by wellington's troops in the battle of waterloo a victorian dress sword and an infantry officer's sword all together this impressive collection could make one hundred at auction the rummage continues apace while jonty and anne round up the valuables i go in search of malcolm to find out more about his precious tractor and surprise surprise just look where i find him hello malcolm is this it is this the tractor
yes this is the little tractor
tell me about the gadgets you need for this
the bit i want to go on it is a front loading shovel which comes on the front here which literally will pick up things from the ground lift them up carry them and tip them it would make my life so much easier rather than having to put everything into a wheelbarrow move the wheelbarrow and tip it i could fix it to the front of the machine and it would be fantastic
so what do your friends and family think of all this
they think we're mad here we are sixty sixty five embarking on working six to seven days a week but we enjoy it
we're looking to raise some money but how do you feel about selling some of your collections
well i need to move on times have changed we enjoy the outside life i don't necessarily enjoy sitting indoors looking at my antique books or looking at some of my items that i've got
obviously you need this vital piece of equipment for the tractor and anne is really looking for this animal shelter who do you think's going to win
i think she's got a good chance of getting it
that's come down through my family it would've been my grandmother's
it's beautiful do you wear it i've never worn it is it something you might think of selling yes jonty are you out there here look at this it's lovely
wow i say what a beautiful little brooch now that's a ruby on the inside there and the colour of the gold is nine carat so that's a nine carat gold brooch if you look at the box because this is the original presentation box it really is in pristine condition that looks like it's never been opened quite extraordinary look at the style of the writing this is the retailer the goldsmith you can date that simply by the box
really that's probably one thousand eight hundred eighty so it's victorian
brooches like this have always been in fashion really since the bronze age they were known as fibulas
can you tell whether that's a good quality ruby
they would really vary what one needs to do is have a really close look under a microscope value wise you're not talking a huge sum of money because dealers have to buy this to make a profit so you're talking what fifty to one hundred
have you got anything else like that i'm thinking a great big tiara matching necklace
i've been searching
i've never worn it my mother i can't recall ever wore it so i don't think it has such a huge sentimental value that i'm not prepared to part with it so i'm quite happy for that to go forward to the auction
anne also decides that these hand made n. a. o. figurines she collects on trips to spain can be given up for the farm fund all three porcelain pieces date from the mid nineteen eighties and were produced by veteran craftsmen at the pottery's workshops near the spanish city of valencia there's no reining in myself or anne but while we're driving forward in our quest to hit our two thousand five hundred target we're being overtaken by an insatiable jonty
malcolm let's have a look at this this is a beautiful beast so is this an old friend is it something you've used doesn't look like it
no it hasn't been used
historically model yachts model boats have been around since the ancient egyptians they were the ones who put their model boats into tombs to take them into the next world the afterlife
oh right but really prior to the eighteenth century
the beginning part of the eighteenth century ships boats yachts were not built from plans they were just solely built by scale models
ah
that's the reason why you see so many certainly at maritime museums you see these amazing fabulous quality ships and boats in these wonderful cases but also in the victorian times they used model yachts like this of similar style to be boys' toys not only were they boys' toys they were grown up boys too you and i would be playing with these on the pond for instance this model here however is styled probably on a twenties yacht between the wars a yacht in full sail like this still looks very dramatic
that's why it caught my eye
yeah so we can certainly put that into auction what did you pay for it
i didn't pay anything for it
nothing at all
i relieved it from a skip
excellent because we've got that and there's a small model yacht i've just seen up there as well sitting up there but we put those two together at auction seventy to ninety quid
sounds like a good deal
i'm very pleased with those for something that i saved from being smashed to smithereens a very good result very pleased with that thanks guys
shall i stop him yes hello
hello you're beautiful aren't you so is this your favourite horse
he was my first horse he was my fiftieth birthday present
oh how lovely
so do you ride a lot
not as much as i used to cos i'm sixty in may and when we moved here obviously my time's divided amongst all the other jobs that we have to do so to make it less frantic riding wise i have taught him western riding so i've slowed down all his paces so he will now jog instead of trot and in his past training in english riding you're always driving them forward to get a more active this and that and now i've asked him to do don't do active please do flopping about more and he's fine with that cos he's getting older as well as me
so is the field shelter for him
it's to be shared because we're at the top of the hill we're very very exposed to the high winds so i really need to have somewhere where the horses can just tuck themselves away from the wind and rain
and what's malcolm's view on that
well he thinks that horses can just turn their bottoms to the wind and get on with it because he's got more important things to spend the money on which is obviously a reasonably fair comment and um so yes so the little argument continues
but how important is this tractor appendage then
he's got to suffer more before i give in
let's see how much he is suffering let's see if they've found anything to sell come on bounty a. n. n. and malcolm are both determined to get their own way on the farm malcolm needs that front loader for his tractor but a. n. n. is desperate to give the horses a field shelter i don't know how this is going to end but we're galloping ahead with the rummage we have to keep up the pace if we're to hit our two thousand five hundred target otherwise they'll both be bitterly disappointed no one is getting an easy ride and if it is a competition is malcolm about to play his joker
i've got these jonty what have you got i've got a collection of medals oh wow some from the first world war and some from prior to that
earlier than the first world war
oh yes i've actually got that little collection there
what have we got here this is the afghan afghanistan medal
yes one thousand eight hundred seventy eight we've got an indian elephant there
it kind of like sums up the whole atmosphere of the place quite extraordinary and a crimea medal yes wow
i actually have these two gentlemen's service history where they enlisted where they were born what scars they had on their bodies when they enlisted
how did you find all that out
well you can actually get that information from government sources
so all these medals here are nineteenth century part of the empire campaigns yes so that's wonderful what else have we got here
again exactly the same period
good i can see here collection just as a rough ballpark
probably around the one thousand five hundred mark
fantastic are you happy about that most certainly
so are you ready to let these go now
i think so i've got to let them go
these medals could bring in more than half our two thousand five hundred target but it depends on the day if the right collectors are there whether they reach their full potential nothing in life is guaranteed that's why we're not leaving anything to chance and every space is getting a thorough going over meanwhile jonty who just loves his furniture looks enthralled
it does have a story my mother worked in an office in london and during the war the offices were bombed the staff were told to take out anything from the damage that they might like to have my mother had always admired this desk which at the time was limed oak but this desk actually belonged to the office boy at the time and the name of the office boy was hardy amies
dressmaker to the queen wow
so she took it home and cleaned it up and then it lost the limed finish and it's been like this ever since
so it's changed colour it's now gone that sort of polished oak so it almost looks as you've cut the oak tree it's more natural looking whereas limed oak as the names suggest literally bleaches the oak so it has that greeny hue to it yes if you look at the style here it certainly looks like a pre war piece of furniture this is a bureau so it's a full front you've got these two arms that support that down below we have this simple construction the two drawers but from a stylistic point of view these handles here are art deco so simplicity was the name of the game and then on the base here we're on these four square legs chamfered on the inside i think this is a fabulous fabulous story you've just told me but what we need is proof for instance if you had a picture of the office boy the then to be or soon to be dressmaker to the queen sitting at this desk then it would make a fantastic story it would therefore be something you could then sell on yeah but just hearsay i'm afraid in our business is not good enough
doesn't mean anything
as a consequence we're looking at forty to sixty only at auction would you consider putting that into the sale
i'm not sure i'd like to think about it because it is quite dinky and there's obviously some sentimentality
we'll leave that there you need some extra time to think about that so we'll carry on searching
i might not be able to part with it it's quite small i can fit it into a corner i might just keep it
jonty what have you got this is a french percussion rifle
wow quite extraordinary it's so it looks sort of early nineteenth century doesn't it
yes it is it is yes this will have been it's a french rifle it would have been used against the british army during the battle of waterloo and possibly all through the peninsula campaigns with wellington
yes i have taken the mechanism out from the lock and stamped on the back of that is the maker's mark saint etienne in france
which would all make sense yep so that lock might well be original but when i look closely over here i'm a bit concerned that that's not two hundred years' worth of wear there so there are huge question marks also the width of the base of the barrel here on an original rifle that shouldn't necessarily be the case so we're talking two figures here possibly four hundred to seven hundred
four hundred to seven hundred for that
well i've got a bit of a question mark on this rifle here so i need to take it along to the auction room to do so more investigation
yes i think we're
it looks as if it could be promising
we've got so much militaria here so much militaria that i suggest we take it all to a specialist sale and all the other items can go to a general sale
somebody's got a bargain
do things get more desperate at our military specialist
if you are furnishing a pub or an old house and you want something for the mantelpiece it looks the part
no that's going to be sailing out of the auction
now we've obviously got quite a lot of people here already i'm interested to know if they've brought that desk i haven't seen it so i'm not sure whether they have or not because a. n. n. was very attached to that a lovely story to it shall we go and find out what reserves we've got on what come on this is the first of two auctions for a. n. n. and malcolm their general items go under the hammer today while malcolm's military connection will go into a specialist sale in a few days' time good morning how are you we're very well what does it feel like to see your little bits and pieces here now
yeah well they look quite sweet on that table
one thing we have not spotted is your desk have you brought it
no i didn't bring it it's still at home in pride of place and i just couldn't bring myself to let it go
too much sentimental value
that's fair enough now the brooch in that lovely original box jonty thinks you've put a reserve on that is that right
i didn't put a fixed reserve on it i've left it with a discretionary reserve on the estimate that jonty placed
what's a discretionary reserve jonty how does that work
there's lots of people here we want to make sure they dig deep into their pockets shall we get into position come on then follow jonty so we're minus the oak cabinet that could have bumped up our total by sixty but there is a specialist military auction to come so we're not solely relying on today's sale to hit our target before we saddle up for the main event we get an idea of how our lots could perform from auctioneer james fletcher
the sun is shining that always helps and there are a lot of goods on offer which should meet a ready market for those who are collecting items
do remember if you are planning to buy or sell at auction you will have to pay various fees such as commission which may vary between auction houses
right morning ladies and gentlemen
our auctioneer is in position and there is a palpable air of anticipation with all the bidders at the ready we're straight in to our first lot of the day
lot eighteen a is the small wooden model of a yacht and a larger modern example
the pristine model boats that malcolm amazingly salvaged from a skip
malcolm remind us how much you paid for this model boat
they didn't cost me anything
so any money is good money is good money
fifty to start me well thirty then surely thirty i'm bid at thirty thirty come on thirty five forty forty five fifty fifty five there at fifty five
this is good yes
at fifty five sixty five sixty five still there at sixty five at sixty five are you all finished and done with that at sixty five i'm selling at sixty five
well done sixty five and it came out of a skip
i shall be going out with the horse and the cart going round all the skips in our area picking everything out
my mother gave them to me i don't think she realised that i wasn't keen on fox hunting
i'm starting these at sixty five sixty five i'm bid at sixty five sixty five at sixty five at sixty five are you all finished and done it's a maiden bid of sixty five
sixty five what do you think of that
i think that's quite good actually i'm happy with that yep
at thirty five are you all finished and done
the auction room hasn't thinned out and with all of these bidders still primed for action we need them to stump up some cash
so next up is the collection of goss crested ware which i found are you happy to see this going
yes we are it's been in a box for four years hasn't it
and i'm starting this at fifty five fifty five i'm bid at fifty five at fifty five at fifty five at fifty five we'll have to leave that
no i think the only commission bid there was around fifty five and he hasn't sold it for that so it means it'll be going back home how do you feel about that malcolm
well we may leave it here for another auction
a good idea especially for anne who is keen to keep her dusting to a minimum we need as much cash as we can get to help anne and malcolm on the farm but things are looking extremely shaky now with malcolm's military collection going to a specialist auction we've only three lots left in this general sale and so far we've hardly dented our two thousand five hundred target we need to avert a mini disaster but best keep on a brave face the victorian pin brooch is up next and unfortunately it's more bad news on closer inspection we've discovered that the ruby gemstone is in fact a garnet which is considerably less in value but it still caught the eye of auctioneer james fletcher
the brooch always meets demand victorian jewellery is individual somebody will snap this up i'm sure
what would you like to see it go for ooh one hundred
that's not going to happen
i don't know i have every confidence this is going to sell remember anne has placed a discretionary reserve on the brooch's lower estimate of fifty
do you know what i do not think this is going to sell
don't say that at thirty five at thirty five forty forty five fifty fifty there at fifty all finished and done with at fifty sold at fifty
fifty so what do you think of that
anne doesn't look too convinced but it's another sale and all for a good cause if it's going to help her horses get their field shelter
the price that it eventually achieved was fair enough disappointing that it was not a ruby stone but it was a fair price for the garnet
next the royal doulton miniature ladies go under the hammer and turn some heads to add seventy five into the farm fund the end of the general auction is in sight and our last lot up for grabs which will have to storm to the final post if we're going to have any chance of hitting our elusive target
sixty a is the royal doulton dinner and tea service
with all the washing up this involved anne was happy to let it go but will they manage to clean up today
twenty five then at twenty five twenty five thirty thirty five forty there at forty forty five fifty fifty fifty five sixty sixty at sixty you all finished and done
right sixty what do you feel on that somebody has got a bargain
the royal doulton dinner service just managed to pip its bottom reserve which sadly has been a bit of a theme today there is nothing we can do about that now as we have come to the end of the auction and the question is are we still in the race for our two thousand five hundred target right that's the end of our lot that we've put into this general sale today the total comes to three hundred sixty
that is good
but don't forget you have all those military items it'll be very interesting to see what happens to that anne and malcolm are looking positive even if they've only raised a fraction of the money they need let's hope we can pull back from the brink at malcolm's specialist military sale a few days after the general auction down in surrey it's life as usual for anne and malcolm who have had time to mull things over
that is putting it mildly but the horse lovers are still determined to get something for their livery yard
malcolm and i have umming and ahing about what to do we have both come to the same decision that we're going to go for the front loader because it is more important at this stage
this is where the front loading bucket is going to be ideal for me as the wind comes in and blows the sand into heaps i have to load it into the wheelbarrow and then level it out into a low area we always have wheelbarrows in our hands moving hay moving horse bedding picking up horse poo but once we have the front loader
the front loader is going to be far more important to have the field shelter might come another day but it's not a priority
finally decision made now to choose the right model
there they all are there is the actual one there oh yes now that
that would be the business it would yes it really would malcolm really does want this the front loader he is going to be over the moon if the specialist auction raises the money that we are looking for it would be fantastic
with over two thousand needed to hit target everything rides on the specialist military sale
i have collected my medals and swords for a long time yes i am reasonably confident i think we could get a good result
a few days later and true to his word jonty has travelled to cambridgeshire to get the low down on malcolm's military memorabilia he has already deposited the collection with military specialist and auctioneer tim blythe who's developed an interest in militaria as a youth if anyone can spot whether malcolm's french rifle is the genuine article or not tim certainly can
hi tim hi how are you how you doing what d'you think i've had a question mark over this rifle i've got a couple of question marks i think it's a reproduction but it has been made
with some original parts so it's not all bad news
what are the tell tale signs we're looking for here most of all
quality of the wood on the stock which isn't up to what you'd expect it to be
yes that was a major concern of mine
also the patch box on here that looks too small for my liking it is too small you wouldn't normally find that on a military musket that's not a good sign either the whole thing is probably something that has been brought in from india in the sixties
malcolm is going to be thrilled
good that's much more than i thought
what about the collection of medals this is wonderful you can see how much love
has gone into presenting these we have the regiments the guys' numbers absolutely everything service history from the nineteenth century which is great this pair particularly the star and the sudan medal i can see those going for probably two hundred for the pair good find
brilliant thanks so much thank you
and we're still in the historic cathedral city in cambridgeshire for anne and malcolm's second specialist auction it has been a couple of weeks since we made three hundred sixty at the general sale but remember we are looking to make two thousand five hundred so it is all down to the military sale in which malcolm's collection of guns swords and medals goes under the hammer let us see what happens anne and malcolm arrive just in time to take a good look around the auction house where the specialist militaria sale takes place jonty who's riding solo today doesn't waste time in tracking them both down
it's the day of reckoning isn't it it is how are you feeling this collection has taken you years to get together and it's going to take literally minutes to sell is there any particular one item that you're going to be sad to see go today or have you now i've resigned myself that it's time to let go have you put any reserves on anything
i have put three modest reserves on three items which ones the musket the flint lock and one of the swords
what about you are you happy to see the collection go
i am perfectly happy to see them go because i never understood the fascination of them in the first place it was malcolm's hobby and interest
plus you had to dust them dust them and put them on display
it's not a problem for me we've got a really tough day today
it's a big challenge because at the general sale we only made three hundred sixty we have a target of two thousand five hundred to aim for there's a lot riding on this are you ready to do battle literally
absolutely fingers crossed
we haven't told malcolm the values of his military collection simply because this is a specialist area where prices are dictated by the bidders who are all experts in their military fields so what does the auctioneer think
we've taken a lot of phone enquiries about them they're very interesting they're a little bit off the norm i'm very hopeful we're gonna get a bit of action in the room on these
we're under starter's orders with the first of malcolm's offerings within our sights right this is the pistol
lot ninety five rather a nice one let's hope the sentiments are felt in the room
and this pistol gets us off the mark in our race to get closer to our two thousand five hundred target
at one hundred eighty one hundred ninety two hundred two hundred ten here in the room at two hundred ten two hundred twenty two hundred thirty it's still here goes then at two hundred thirty at two hundred thirty in the room are you all done two hundred forty at two hundred forty now new money at two hundred forty two hundred fifty back here at two hundred fifty finished at two hundred fifty well done yeah fine
that's good malcolm doesn't look too convinced
maybe his nerves are kicking in it's a fantastic start with his flint lock pistol going well over its estimate
lot one hundred seventy five is the percussion musket
you put a reserve on this one yes i have all right so are you taking it back or not
we'll see
malcolm's french rifle turned out not to be the real deal that hasn't stopped him taking a gamble and putting a reserve of one hundred ninety which is above estimate
one hundred i've got at one hundred one hundred ten at one hundred ten only done then at one hundred ten one hundred twenty one hundred thirty one hundred forty one hundred fifty one hundred sixty one hundred seventy one hundred eighty i might be taking it home one hundred ninety at one hundred ninety is that it you are all done at one hundred ninety finished and done at one hundred ninety he took it up to one hundred ninety that means there wasn't a bid in the room at one hundred ninety the under bidder would've been one hundred eighty
so putting a one hundred ninety reserve did backfire as the rifle's gone unsold malcolm could be saying goodbye to that tractor front loader jonty originally estimated malcolm's handsome collection of swords at around one hundred but our military specialist stunned jonty when he valued them at three times as much remember malcolm's in the dark over this they're now being sold individually so could he be in for a big surprise
what reserve did you put on that
i can't remember now
a couple of hundred quid on bid two hundred two hundred twenty two hundred thirty two hundred forty two hundred fifty two hundred sixty two hundred seventy two hundred eighty two hundred ninety three hundred at three hundred now this side at three hundred at three hundred only it goes then three hundred twenty three hundred thirty
this is a good sword
at three hundred thirty seated in the room at three hundred thirty is that it at three hundred thirty
i'm convinced that that was used at waterloo
we believe you malcolm and that was a fantastic result at three hundred thirty the rest of malcolm's nineteenth century swords provide reinforcements for the troops when they come under the hammer finished and done at one hundred fifty
at one hundred sixty at one hundred seventy anybody else
they win the battle to amass a total of eight hundred ten
well done they've gone now yep aw aw
i was very pleased with the result on that very pleased it was it was good it was good
what a difference a specialist auction makes malcolm's military collection is storming the room here at blythe's so much so that it finally looks like that two thousand five hundred target could be within reach we finally get to malcolm's medals that he's lovingly collected over a number of years they're also all going to be auctioned off separately
anne have you ever really studied these medals or was it always malcolm's domain
always malcolm's domain but he can talk for hours on it over countless numbers of evening meals once you press the right button on malcolm he will talk for hours on the subject
so let's hope for anne's sake and sanity they all get snapped up
this next medal issued in one thousand eight hundred fifty five is from the crimean campaign when did you buy that
lot fifty six the crimea medal rather a nice one various bidding on this i'll go straight in one hundred one hundred ten one hundred twenty one hundred thirty one hundred forty one hundred fifty one hundred sixty with me at one hundred sixty now at one hundred sixty take one hundred seventy one hundred seventy here in the room the seated bidder of one hundred seventy down here in the room at one hundred seventy
what a result good result
one hundred seventy is a fantastic sale and we still have so many more medals up for grabs
lot sixty nine the indian general service medal a very nice one again various bids on this one hundred one hundred ten one hundred twenty one hundred thirty one hundred forty one hundred fifty one hundred sixty one hundred seventy one hundred eighty at one hundred eighty all done then at one hundred eighty
we got there this is obviously very emotional for malcolm
who's seeing his forty year old collection of medals disappear but with medals going for the likes of one hundred eighty his sacrifice will be worth it
lot thirty four the victory medal world war one lot forty eight one hundred one hundred ten one hundred twenty one hundred thirty
this is the egypt medals there's been a lot of interest it'll be fascinating to see where the hammer falls
lot seventy eight is the nineteenth century north africa pair of medals
our military specialist was taken with these medals and reckons these could get enough interest to secure the two hundred mark
rather nice these various bids on these at one hundred ninety two hundred and ten i've got two hundred twenty at two hundred twenty now two hundred thirty two hundred forty two hundred fifty two hundred sixty two hundred seventy two hundred eighty two hundred ninety three hundred three hundred ten three hundred twenty three hundred thirty three hundred thirty three hundred forty three hundred fifty three hundred sixty three hundred seventy you're here you might as well three hundred seventy behind you three hundred eighty three hundred ninety i sell behind you at three hundred ninety four hundred four hundred ten four hundred twenty four hundred thirty four hundred forty four hundred fifty i sell behind you four hundred sixty four hundred fifty in the top corner anyone else at four hundred fifty goes then at four hundred fifty four hundred sixty four hundred seventy four hundred eighty four hundred ninety at four hundred ninety at four hundred ninety i sell behind you five hundred five hundred five hundred twenty behind you at five hundred twenty goes then seated at the back at five hundred twenty five hundred thirty five hundred fifty sir five hundred fifty at five hundred fifty five hundred sixty at five hundred sixty second row at five hundred sixty
how do you feel now good i didn't expect to pay that much but i was pleased to actually get them because i collect that exact medal to them so there's the roll of seven hundred eleven men i have now twenty eight of them so that's why i didn't stop
and we're just glad this bidder turned up for all those men and his contribution brings our medals total to one thousand seven hundred six way over estimate with that bumper result it looks like malcolm's tractor front loader could be winging its way to the farm so does that mean we've managed to trounce our target
good heavens
so the grand total is three thousand one hundred twenty six wow
that's amazing it really is good
you can have half a field shelter
or a couple of planks to go towards it
two weeks later anne and malcolm are still reeling from such an incredible result at the specialist auction
it was fantastic we did really well there were people there bidding on the day exactly what we wanted exactly what we hoped for most of my stuff has gone to people that are collectors which is good i'm very pleased there's even more to celebrate front loader's arriving today i am excited about it i'm really looking forward to it it should be great
and with the new piece of equipment safely deposited malcolm wastes no time in giving the hotly anticipated arrival a test drive
it's going to take me i think a few hours to learn how to use all the controls you pull this lever like this to raise it up if i turn it to the right watch what the bucket does tips out right it's brilliant it's gonna save me a lot of time a lot of effort so can life get any sweeter i've managed to get my front loader which i always wanted i jokingly said to anne at the auction afterwards that i'd get her half a field shelter but i've been thinking about it she deserves a full field shelter so we're getting a field shelter as well
a whole one with sides and a roof with sides and a roof yep fantastic thank you malcolm
watch the world go round
bum bum bum
barnaby i won a drawing competition
wow that's wonderful becky i always knew you were a good drawer what did you win it says i've won a trip to chester zoo tomorrow the zoo brilliant

you don't do something people will blame retrospectively so in a sense you can't win
all that is coming up in the next half an hour and with us for the whole programme today is the former editor of the sun kelvin mackenzie welcome to the programme let's particular off with the report on the armed forces within the last hour the former conservative m. p. who you might remember joined labour last summer gave his recommendations for boosting support for the services
we have a whole lot of proposals all of which are designed to bring the armed forces and the rest of society closer together and a closer understanding of the military the most dramatic ones are proposals for wearing uniforms more and proposals for cadets and veterans days and legislation to protect the uniform so we don't have any cases in the future of discrimination or harassment of people wearing uniforms
what do you make of those ideas cadets' days and more recognises of the armed forces
later in the programme but now it's time for our daily quiz today concerned with the sun at the end of the programme kelvin will give us the correct answer and if you want to send us your comments about any of today's stories about the armed forces do get e. mailing we'll read out some of your thoughts later in the programme now all eyes this week will be on the latest test of gordon brown's premiership yes the by election in crewe and nantwich caused by the death of the labour stall wort gwyneth done weedy after the conservatives' strong showing in other elections labour strategists are already playing down their prrpts if david cameron's prospects if david cameron's does win it would be the first conservative in the area since nineteen sixty seven david cameron is en route there but before that he made a speech about taxation
victory at local election gives us an opportunity to do is exactly this explain to people our standing in the polls gives us an opportunity for the conservatives to be taken seriously and for speeches like today's announcement by david and whilst we start to flesh that out it gives us an opportunity to move on to politics
i'm sorry i didn't detect an answer there will the conservatives cut taxes if they win the next election
well you've heard what my leader has said and he laid that out and if you want details i'm afraid i can't tell you because i'm not responsible for that i'm not shadow chancellor but if you want to ask me some more questions on tax i'll do my best to avoid answering you but what can we do for you
so you're avoiding answering the question because you don't know the answer
of course am not the shadow char and when the time comes for us to give a detailed explanation we will do so but we have the responsibility the problem is if we produce our tax ideas the chancellor will steal them we saw that happen on inheritance tax and various things because the guy didn't understand what he was doing and that's why we had to have an emergency budget but we'll do our best to produces these over the coming weeks
i take the point that you are not the chancellor but you are in charge of the campaign in the by election in crewe
i am indeed
of crewe is that a conservative administration wouldn't have it taxed the poor in order to pay for the poor and what we've had is robin hood in reverse and there is deep anger that a labour government used its powers to take money from very poor people to give it to poor people and there are somewhere in the region of two thousand people still in crewe who have not been compensated by this government and who have been forgotten by this government and i'm clear that a conservative government would not have done that
zone of negative if anyone is running a negative campaign it is labour that grand theft auto is not a poster but a piece of literature that has been popular in crewe and nantwich and we have been stressing the worries that people have about the local post office and their sorting office and the worries that their railway station may be relocated so we have been particularly positive and isle tell you for why because when we come into town the national parties we want to leave crewe stronger and i'm afraid labour's campaign has been rather base and nasty and has sought to stir people up in a quite
going to romp through
well we could have a very good result if the voters come out but we could only win it with labour switches and we do know that labour switching is taking place and the liberal democrats are voting for us whether we have enough remains to be seen
i think it is unnecessary and undesirable it is firstly unnecessary because we need to embrace stem cell research it is proving to have a great potential in the area of adult stem cell research and umbilical chord cell research but the human animal embryos are very problematic on the science and is be set by problems in terms of research there are concerns that this research would lead to risks in relation to infection immune reactions tumours and in many ways unsafe and dangerous clinical applications so why not let's invest and focus on those areas that are producing results rather than what are in many ways a distraction it also has ethical concerns which is mixing the issue of animal identities and human identities and my view is that we have a good ethical alternative and we should be promoting that rather than going down what is in many ways a blind alley
but many scientists say you need the human animal embryo research to go on in order to find cures for things like parkinson's and motor neurone disease are you not standing in the way of progress
no in many ways i feel it is taking us backwards in the way that the world out there is looking in other developments we are first in the world over umbilical cord research in a draft bill we're not able to come up with the scientific experiments or the research they could base it on to say this is now going to lead to treatment and theraputic value it is speculative and an area we don't need to go down we can use the wonderful research in other areas
how much support do you have are you confident that you will be able to defeat this part of the bill
well it's hard to know it is a free vote many members are keeping their cards close to their chest so we don't know until the vote takes place my hunch is that many members will be particularly concerned to limit the extent of this hybrid embryo they will be particularly concerned about the application to full hybrids the mixing of human sperm and animal eggs and vice versa no scientist has been able to say this has any therapeutic value there may be some extra limitations on the ground whether lead to an outright ban is open to question
puzzle and one you can have adult stem cells you can have embryonic stem cells and stem cells developed from hybrids each of those will tell us something different we hope to combine the information we get we know that adult stem cells are very good at making muscle cells that can be transplanted into the heart we know that adult stem cells are not as pliable as embryonic stem cells there is no evidence that we can get adult stem cells to make embryonic stem cells how yo go from a stem cell to a nerve cell then we can possibly adapt that information to adult stem cells and transform them into the nerve cells that may be used in transplantation to give hope to ultimately give a cure for those with parkinson's
you would argue that human animal hybrids offer a unique way of conducting research if it gets overturned how would that affect your research and possible cures for diseases
side about mixing animal and human cells even if you reassure us that it will be destroyed within fourteen days to many people it does sound extremely strange
alzheimer's i will be saying bring it on and the other way to check against these arguments is to find out who is on the other side and when you find out that it's religious groups on the other side who are guided by something out there which they can't define properly you say i'm on the right side of this argument i will always be very wary of religion when it is pressing against advance medical or scientific breakthroughs
is this the only way that you and your fellow scientists the animal human hybrids is this the only way you are going to be able to find cures
this is one way in which we can help to understand stem cells and nerve cells
there are other ways but not
for certain diseases not not for certain diseases adult stem cells are not sufficiently pliable at the moment as we understand them to make nerve cells so we need to investigate all areas
your e. mails simon smith talking about the proposals for quentin davies cadets in state schools sounds like the cannon fodder for future wars l. was a member of the royal navy for six years and the armed forces should be allowed to wear their uniform with pride and responsibility harry says no wonder soldiers do not have pride the majority of people in this country were against the war in iraq now if you are a driver you will know how expensive it is to run a car tot up road tax insurance the cost of petrol and you are looking at a large slab of household income things are about to get more expensive for motorists in nottingham its city council has become the first local authority to impose a tax on company car parking spaces all businesses with more than ten spaces are going to have to pay one hundred eighty five per space rising to three hundred fifty within six years anne alexander has been to nottingham to find out more nottingham city centre during the lunch time rush the cars are bumper to bumper as you can see it is busy here and a lot of the motorists would have driven into work the local council is hoping that its new scheme will help stop the traffic
we will be raising a levy of one hundred eighty five a year on every firm in the city which has more than ten parking spaces all that money will be put into a fund and then spent on transport to
pricing scheme instead putting the onus on councils to set up local projects nottingham city council will take the political flak for this measure but it is hoping the benefits better public transport using the estimated twelve million it will soften the blow a series of buses will be expanded this one goes out to one of main trading estates there will also be more buses the main beneficiary will be the city's tram system which will get a new line thanks to some of the cash raised from the scheme these tram users have concerns about the tax
i think the tram is brilliant and i wouldn't drive into town at all l. suppose people that work in town if they have got a place to park i can understand them not being very happy
i don't drive myself l. can feel for the drivers but anything that will reduce our carbon footprint and stop the congestion is a good idea
it is difficult for the people that live in the south to get into work and i know the bus system can be bit difficult to use i'm lucky because i live in the north of nottingham and can get the tram
shying away from radical action is simply not an option says councillor chapman
as you can see there's quite a substantial amount of congestion because nottingham is expanding and there is congestion if we don't do something it will get worse this investment has be made now before it is too late
anne alexander kelvin mackenzie was watching that with me and he stood in the recent local elections as an independent campaigner against high parking costs i'm guessing you don't agree with nottingham city council
this is just tax raising by another means
what if it is ringfenced they will spend it on the local tram service
that is what they say it won't work out like that yes we need a park over here we need a bit of dustbins over here the idea that it will be three hundred fifty in six years and in sixteen years it will be three thousand five hundred lit make no difference to the congestion in nottingham they are clobbering a massively easy target which this labour government are fingered as their new way of raising taxes so it's a disgrace it won't work it didn't work in london the cars are going slower today than ever before but there's tens of millions coming in for mad left of centre councils to spend
something has to be done about congestion how do you tackle it
out the guy locally who voted for it what happened l. l. beat the lib zems but the tory got it lib dems but the tory got it
so people didn't support you
answer to our quiz we must move on there is time before we go to find out the answer the question was
what has caught your eye
i have had my head in the show gardens and i have seen just a few of the big gardens but what i have seen is fantastic we say each year the quality is better but i think this year it is there is some great gardens there
you have been busy working
yes this is like a holiday now

one gardens missing this this one andy's own
has not been cleaned it is this paving the next time we will use brown paving so it does not show the dirtd
it is quite woodland
i have this woodland it is clean hard lines with the wall and soft this woodland atmosphere that is
i can relax tomorrow when we get the results
yes back from this wonderful first trip i look forward to doing this because we get fantastic opportunity to bring all of the viewers in and see the plants study things in detail talk to the people exhibiting here
where do you start you walk in and it is sea of colour there is so much to see where do you take us
today we have been all around the world and we have been concentrating on find out about which plants like growing where right plant right place that is what gardeners want to know
so if you want extra information you can get it on online
press that red wut button
i won't miss this opportunity to have my own tour which stand are we on now
this is hilliers stand it is central to the whole pavilion it is about growing against the odds they have teamed up with this whole maritime sort of theme every where you see plants that would do well in difficult conditions when it is hot and dry they can't put sun tan cream on
what about a city garden
yes a roof top garden these plants would be ideal there is stuff here you couldn't put this on your roof but it is monkey pulz tree
i have seen those in england monkey puzzle are they easy to grow
it is from new zealand but it is easy if you have it in the right place
what about that bottle brush i have seen that in france could i grow it mere
yes you can grow it in almost
and not get really cold conditions if you live up further north you will get away with it with a wall behind it
these could inspire us and we could take home
yes that is what it is about
red button and then follow the instructions there is plenty more to come from the chelsea flower show the gardening olympians charting a course for chelsea gold bite sized chelsea small gardens big ideas and no place for shrinking violets the plant paparazzi turn their irises on a bunch of celebs if you have a high definition t. v. you'll be able to enjoy the show in cinematic splendor on the b. b. c. h. d. channel sharting from seven p. m. this evening one of the great olympians from chelsea is hilliers of the team from shamshire has won sixty two consecutive gold medals this year they hope to at to their tally with sail for gold what's the secret to your success
it's all about having the right plantle material this exhibit measures twenty metres by twenty two metres
it's pretty big
it takes about
that we have any way these large trees in containers on our nursery some of the show plants like that cornus there that's been to
i always think of your stand as being mainly about the shrubs there are exciting things just walking by here there's quoit a
few different cornus i i love this
habit i love the way the flowers start to blush those are just start to colour now if full sun it goes really quite salmon pink the acer alls stars of the show people love the acers
this part of the garden is quite different this
it's very maritime all this it has that feel about it
display of plants there's so much more into it there's always a lot
good luck
thank you
good luck
staggering some of the most popular exhibits at chelsea are the small guard nds which often inspire great ideas to take home especially if like me gardening is a hobby rather than profession there are twenty two small gardens at chelsea this year they're divided into two categories urban and court yard andy went on a mini mission to prove small is beautiful the court yard gardens are tucked away at the back of the show ground i've got three to kick us off forty two catherine street set in a partially shaded corner rusting iron work and reclaimed materials are plnted with many different shades of green sculptures and ageing structures blend easily into the guard be garden a planted carpet formss the centrepiece the purple and plum foliage complement it butte fully next is mist placed it's set within the ground of a large victorian estate the nooks and canies in the walls have been colonised by mosses and ferns which love the damp environment a lingering mist creates a mysterious ambience and the calm and simple planting uses creamy white foxgloves to make tranquil garden our final court yard garden is called the way forward it's designed to help people confidently
address global warming it's
what can i take from some of those that we've seen the small garden is a important ingredient of chelsea people can relate to them so easily you can take lots of things from them might be the materials they use the wall finish could be even the combination of plants there's a lot there
for me they're more realistic though they push the boundaries i can imagine some of those in an ideal world being transported home
the other thing about some of them is they haven't got huge budgets they've had to be innovative with the money they've got that also makes it much more realistic for most people
we all have to keep an eye on the purse strings it's press day at chelsea the day when the world's media deskrends on the show hope to school horticultural headlines it must be one of the few days when the celebrities take second place to the plants l. braved the throng to find out why chelsea puts all other shows in the shade
i come every year i can i love it it is so quintessentially english it's like when the sun's out like this and it's may and there's colour everywhere it's fantastic
lovely to see you here at chelsea are you a regular visitor
i love chelsea for me it's just the biggest thing chelsea symbolises the beginning of summer whatever the weather was going to do today i was going to wear linen and summer clothes for me this is it summer starts here
haven't seen them all the telegraph garden was wonderful the lauren perrier garden was wonderful when i was doing monarch of the glen they had to put in a line saying i'm afraid my wife's at chelsea i asked to have time off from filming in order to be here l. just love it
they speak japanese
glamorous ladies are you enjoying it so far
loving it l. haven't been here that long but loving it chelsea's our special day
you're an old kid you
i doubt it my wife is the gardener of the family
i just go and dust i know you've only just arrived here we are in the bupa garden what are your first impressions
i'm thrilled to be here because this is designed for people suffering from dementia my mother had dementia so it's very dear to my heart it's got the x. factor this garden
almost too much
yeah lots to see a long way much to go as well
you see so much on the first day it's hard to talk it all in l. l. need a couple of days to settle down and study things more closely do you feel you've just closely had the tip of the iceberg just just the frosting on the top i think jo a long way to go
chris anything that really excited you today that you haven't seen before
the roses i better look at andy's garden i've heard it's quite good i'll get that in
you love the roses
yes they're quintessential i've
it uplifts you
i have a thing for tropical plants i'm looking forward to that
you talked about quiet summer how confident are you for investors who are stuck in the stock market at the moment
the difficulty we've got is that all around unfortunately the sub prime fall out from the u. s. which we spoke about many times before and the ensuing credit crunch the fact of the matter is that come january or february it was starting to look like maybe a lot of the bad news had come out on the table we then had more writedown some credit suisse in the u. k. we had massive cash calls from rbs and hbos even barclays last week writing down more than a billion pounds for the first quarter although there may be some light at the end of the tunnel in terms of the credit crunch we're not there yet while that uncertainty remains it will be difficult for the market to move on into its next leg
thank you another day another housing price survey according to the property website right move asking prices are actually up despite everything you hear they're up two per cent on year ago but waving more statistics at us today the royal institution of chartered surveyors reckons the number of house sales could drop by an astounding forty per cent by the end of two thousand eight how on earth can we know what's happening ot market and which numbers should we believe here is rachel's bluffer's guide today's survey from property website right move says the average asking price for property in the u. k. has risen by twenty two per cent since last year to an average of two hundred forty two five hundred other surveys have told us house prices are falling why are asking prices rising
right move weren't the only body releasing housing market statistics this weekend the royal institution of chartered surveyors issued a warning that property sales could be down forty per cent and prices down by five per cent by the end of this year not good news for homeowners but it seems every day it brings a new set of housing market figures whether it's from the government from lenders or estate agents warning us that the market is up
it's down we're on the verge of
they are important if you spend all your time looking at these indicies you might not have time to look for a property we have the three we mentioned there you're getting monthly figures from nationwide we have the department for local government and right move they all give slightly different information because they're all based on slightly different things some put their figures on the mortgage approvals that's not necessarily the price the property finally sells for some use huge sample sizes some are just taking ten thousand to fifteen thousand properties and looking at that it's almost impossible to pick one of these indicies and say that it's the golden index to tell us exactly what's happening in the housing market that's what yolande barnes from the estate agent savills was telling me
what the indicies reveal are the general market conditions in which you're selling clearly we moved from a sellers' market last year to a low turnover buyers' market this year i think the indicies are helpful in that respect but probably we shouldn't pay too much attention to whether the monthly indicies especially are going up and down they do tend to jump around a lot no index is ever going to reflect
and to look back on previous statements and see how much your transactions have charged you by and large there is a card out there that will suit the way you want to use it and it does make sense to do a little bit of
homework before you go away what are the top tips when you are a broad
they this talk about pre paid cards let us talk about pre paid cards quite a lot of different bath mat differences there
are some pitfalls in terms of high you did that transaction how you do the transaction
again it is making your choice as the consumer this is about the retailer having the option of giving you the customer the joys of having the transaction in the local currency warren sterling the choice or in sterling by and large will probably find it is worth going for the local currency option because they knew another rate you're getting is the one the bank is giving you
we thought we would give you a bit more useful information here at the best cadet credit and debit cards on the market at the moment each of those charged three or twenty five per cent per a. t. m. withdrawals for debit cards complicated isn't it in a few decades the over seventies will make up one quarter of the u. k. population the fastest growing sector of the population is the all for one hundreds many of these people will need care over one hundreds that need has given birth to a rapidly growing business we have been to petersfield in hampshire olive canning on the left who is ninety six and alice mitchell ninety two share a flat in petersfield and are determined to stay in it for as long as they can recently social services dared to tell them they ought to move
they did not say we would have to do anything but they advised us of the advisability of going into the care home
what did you think of that
and the home and that was the end of it
they said he would have to
concerned about going into a home we used his feet people saying the nuclear option tomorrow
can we put it off even though we're going to the older
watching eating shopping personal care here two of its carers are working on their national vocational qualifications on health and social care
what we would have seen five years ago is that the fault would be more busy with social services running up and saying we want to buy his care at it inevitably what has happened is that social services and therefore you and me were at axes cannot afford to fund the ageing population you and me with an hour taxes
on a second area so hopefully within the next few years i shall be in a position to take up that and have second office in london
business hundreds if not thousands
morning from bluebird they want to stay in the flat even if they need to increase
unless anything unforeseen happens we can always applied for extra help you can start asked mall amount of time as you like and gradually work it up or just suddenly work it up
there will be so many more people of your age
if they can manage and find people that will help them they will be all right
there is one fly in the ointment bluebird is working hard to train and keep its staff as numbers needing care door the carers themselves are becoming more scarce needing care go all pub later in the week we will be looking at life expectancy if he did not know already the website is a really good place to go if you fancy watching something again just follow the instructions it is easy to understand the government is poised to become the first in the west to issue so called islamic bombs what are they and should he be investing warns under the rules of islamic finance the interest payments is effectively forbidden and there is considered a partner in business the principle behind this means that you cannot either receive a pay interest because islam defines interest as a former of usury which he is not actually allowed a form of usury a common selection is to use at least here the money from investors is used to buy an asset which must accord with islamic or sharia law once the acid is purchased it can be paid to investors when it finishes the underlying assets is sold allowing investors to get back their original investment islamic loans are often structured as profit sharing bencher the principle
behind all this is that there is
sharing of risk this how an islamic bond might work in this way someone who wants to buy a bond gives money to an organisation which buys let's say building for instance the building generates is then paid to the investor instead of interest no interest is paid at the end of the bond when that bond matures the property will have to be sold to give the original money
back to the investor that is how
bond might actually work in that way they have a boy did the whole concept of interest what they have done is generated a regular stream of money just like interest but it is based on sharing the risk in the maxwell business venture of basle bonds are hitting the news today there are already lots of islamic based in investments it looks like it will become a growing area of the market the government
of the u. k. is keen to make cost
they want to help me but our government cut out their help they must come to our country by international law by force
that is the problem there is no details being worked out about how the enormous amounts of international help that are ready for the burmese people will be channelled through what they are called this asian mechanism noerd using organisations and personnel based in neighbouring countries which for face saving reasons the burmese military are willing to accept that hasn't been spelled out but we have had a change of attitude in the last week the burmese government has been insisting it has everything under control and saying it doesn't need foreign aid a this meeting it suggested the principle it does need foreign aid but it's very touchy about the idea of letting westerners have uncontrolled access and how much access the key aid donors is going to be the subject of a lot of negotiation
inhibit britain's ability to be the world leader in stem cell research and would send the wrong message the cell lines will be used by research groups throughout the world to generate therapies for disease therapys we don't have at the current time
several members of liz shipley's family have died from motor neurone disease disease her health is sloesly worsening she wants slowly worsen she wants hybrid research to continue
it brings forth that one day there will be a treatment and a cure not in my lifetime but hopefully if my children are unfortunate enough to develop it hopefully in their lifetime there will be a cure
hybrid embryo research has the support of noble prize winning scientist leading doctors and hundreds of medical charities that may sway many in the commons but ultimately it will be down to the conscience of individual m. p.'s to decide whether the work here should continue or be banned some m. p.'s are deeply sceptical of the claimed benefits of embryonic stem cell research and argue that hybrids are morally objectionable
despite all of this hype about the fact we are going to cure parkinson's and motor neurone disease no one doubts these are terrible diseases if there was a wonder cure of doing it not a single cure has come after twenty years all we have is scientists tellinging us you have to push out the ethical boundaries more and more until there are no boundaries
no that's right the votes here tonight and tomorrow will have far reefing consequences for families for doctor far reaching consequences for doctors and for science and for future generations the strong passes on this cut awe cross party lines it's wurlts point out that the prime minister only allowed a free vote because people felt so strongly around his own cabinet table felt they could not support the government line the first vote is going to be about the use of the hybrid embryos although we are going to see a interesting debate on this it looks like parliament is poised to support moves to allow that to happen that is something that will please the prime minister he thinks that is important in terms of tackling cures for the future later this evening it looks like the vote will go through to allow the saviour siblings
tomorrow's vote the role of fathers in i. v. f. and abortion limits
you can find all of the key facts on the embryology bill on our website police investigating allegations of child abuse at a former children's home in jerzy say that some bone fragments found at the site are human detectives began investigating the care home haut de la garenne four months ago since thin one hundred sixty people have came forward with claims of sexual and physical abuse tell us more about
it's inspirational to come here and see what you can do in very small
chicken coop this is where you get the eggs from three thousand six hundred for a chicken coop after the fashion for green rooms we now have green walls but there are also other issues such as allowing children more opportunity to play outside however mixing kids and chelsea planned perfection isn't easy are you nervous
some solutions to real garden problems even where to put the wheelie bin while this meets new planning regulations about parking vehicles will chelsea because next year the whole event is to apply for planning permission talks are already well under way now there are fresh calls today for the creation of a public holiday to mark the role of the armed forces in society and to boost public recognition of the military a government commissioned report also recommends the annual holiday should celebrate the contribution of veterans our correspondent paul adams is at the ministry of defence for us with more yes the government is concerned that society as a whole understands less and less about what the military does and needs to find more ways of expressing its appreciation despite the reservations people may have about the politics of the wars in iraq and afghanistan this report talks about improving national recognition of the armed forces and makes more than forty recommendations soldiers of the first battalion enjoying a homecoming parade this year a generous public welcome after gruelling service in afghanistan the government wants more of this and agrees there is plenty society can do to make the armed forces feel better value remembrance sunday provides a focus for sombre reflection but today's report calls for a separate armed forces and veterans' day to be held sometime in late june it also wants to see more schools running cadet forces at the moment there are only two hundred sixty units in the whole country only sixty of these in comprehensive schools the report's author is concerned that society and the military are drifting apart
there is much less familiarity with the armed forces than was the case a generation or so ago there is always danger when you have professional armed forces that they become cast apart from society that's not something which should be a good thing for the military or for the rest of us
unemployment lack of housing and crime levels and the immigrants are essentially being scapegoated for those problems there have been attacks on them mobs in johannesburg armed with machetes sticks here are some people who have fled that violence i am in a police station in the centre of johannesburg about fifteen hundred people slept the night here and haven't been fed for twenty four hours there is a serious humanitarian problem here as well
in terms of the police what are they doing do they have the situation under control there and elsewhere
well it's a good question one of the police officers i have spoken to said we need to call in the army the violence has been spreading it's been breaking out in different areas there have been appeals from politicians for calm but so far those appeals have gone unheaded there are a lot of people here who are very worried some have belongings but some have fled here with absolutely nothing l. have spoken to zimmens who want to zimbabwens who want to return home but don't have the noun go back
here despite all the warnings it would seem that many of us are still not taking in basic information about how much alcohol we are drinking and how much is safe three quarters of people questioned in a government survey couldn't say how many units there were in a glass of wine the government's launch ago new careful drinking campaign to increase our awareness our health correspondent jane hughes reports when you go out for drink do you know how much alcohol you are having we have been bombarded with information about alcohol units for years but it seems lot of us are still not getting the message how many units are in that glass of
did you know if women regularly exceed two to three units a day it could add up to a
the young people we spoke to in our study represent drinking as being a it's a fun activity particularly drinking to a point of intoxication it could be fun there is no evidence they were taking account of the units they were drinking and indeed drinking to a point monitoring the drinking in that way so it went against their objective which was to get drunk
when we showed the new ads to these drink terse did have an impact drinkers it did have an impact
you might as well not even drink
i didn't know any of these before l. thought a pint was two a glass of wine was one but it turns out some are even up to three
i would never know this even if it doesn't do nothing at least you know
nice to meet you you too so they're back definitely i've just seen one you missed it the female just went into the cave so how come
how's it happened they've been extinct in cornwall for over fifty years
so they're back now and breeding possibly they've come from brittany but it's a natural re colonisation that's the fantastic thing about this story it's not a reintroduction which has happened with kites and sea eagles in other parts of the country they've come back naturally on their own fantastic amazing
any sign er just yeah
just remember where where the cave with the arch yeah that dark arch yeah there's a little slope there it's just perched quite difficult to see at the moment can you see yes just in the corner
got ya how did they come by the name we don't really know
she spends a lot of time looking after her feathers because she's been sitting the chicks are still quite young so well she's an italian woman no she's not no she's cornish
the grass is nice and short here ciao
i think it's my dodgy impression
ciao mike and alex lord and their dog william were the first to discover the choughs in two thousand two and are now part of a loyal group called choughwatch hello hello hi what is choughwatch
choughwatch is protecting the birds from possible egg collectors twenty four hours a day that's night and day and we have a fantastic band of loyal wonderful keen bird watchers who will do it
first year might name them after cricketers
the first one out was white over green so he became wg the second was brown over lime so he became brian lara and so on
i regard them as my sort of grandchildren grandchoughs really
but why have they come back farmers in the nineteenth century used to graze their cattle on the cliff side keeping the vegetation short but then it became easier and more convenient to graze inland
choughs need access to very short grass they can't feed in scrub
so choughs are choosy
i suppose they are that's a good way of putting it they're specialists so over the last ten twenty years they've been putting animals back on the cliffs ponies cattle some sheep just to try and get all that scrub bashed back really it's worked they're here
now i just need to find out how you're progressing well still suffering vomiting diarrhoea severe stomach cramps are you taking on plenty of fluids i know about the dangers of dehydration your blood pressure seems normal
sorry if i'm a bit i'm just fed up with nothing being done i'm just a bit sick of it no pun intended you are going to log the fact i'm still suffering
yep so as well as taking on plenty of fluids eat plain foods and get plenty of rest by the way has the environmental health officer been onto you
interviewed me and my friends i feel sick
well i'm sure they'll find a link
we already told them the link
the deli on adlem road i saw your friend there this morning you've been giving the owner a hard time she deserves it
she catered for the beach party society meeting we all ate the food we were all ill it's an open and shut case surely
you can't know she's responsible until the tests are finished
no offence but what's it to you i've spoken to environmental health several times and they've told me that when a medical practice notifies a case of gastro then the whole thing is handed over to them and they follow any pertinent leads from there
you don't know she's responsible it could be has to have the last word
hey i've just been playing with that multi colour screen thing
how are you finding it great why am i pink sorry
anyway do you know how i can get more text in the popups
um hang on i did tell her this
he's going to stay here till he feels better so you might not want to wait um did i see you at the deli this morning so well it looked like intimidation to me
we ate her food we were ill she's to blame sounds like something jeremy would say sorry i can't remember it's slipped my mind
i did ask her if she wanted me to write it down she said no
anyway just to let you know that i'm popping back to the mill for some notes
that's fantastic
why you want to get rid of me no you can give me a lift
daniel just to let you know i'm using the sick bay for a vomiting patient
as long as i don't have to clean it up
actually could you take a look it's jeremy thorn you saw him a couple of days ago
er yeah gastroenteritis yeah how many cases have you had i think we've seen five students why
they're trying to blame a local deli owner
and they're harassing her to put her out of business well if she's to blame she probably will go out of business
i should have known you'd be sympathetic happy to help
look don't beat yourself up we're not responsible for what happens when we notify the environmental health
you didn't see her
renal and endocrine are great but i find neuro a real drag
thanks so can i go now doctor
if you feel up to it yeah make sure you get plenty of fluids plain food and lots of bed rest yes
if you that's what you think i need that's what i said so do you think i'll be well enough for the beach party society tonight
you guys have those
you know when some people just really wind you up know the feeling can you do me a favour can you get me the details of all the students we've seen for gastroenteritis if it's anything other than food then we can stop them harassing clare sure
was there a problem in there
nothing for you to worry about
he's headstrong thinks he knows everything we were all like that once were we right i'll be back as fast as i can
i hope not and here's me hoping to do seventy in a built up area
don't you dare
it was a beach party
oh i'll give that three out of ten the car the driving are you testing me well if i was i'd have used the word reckless several times oh i was assessing your suitability for being my driving instructor
i take it i've failed yes but thank you for the lift
never again obviously but nonetheless
pleasure
still open
you
thought i'd let you sweat for a while until i made my grand entrance truth is i've been too ill to come in person before now
you're behind this
dusty why are you doing this to me why do you think you supplied the food we were ill i just want to get justice
that's not what this is about i always get what i want not this time welcome to the real world jeremy
you made a big mistake humiliating me
oh grow up you're pathetic i was the one who was humiliated
make the most of it while you've still got a shop to throw people out of fact you catered for our event fact we all came down with food poisoning fact environmental health came to check out your miserable shop
and they'll realise i'm not responsible
mud sticks who's going to trust you to make a sandwich after all this
you're doing this to me because i want to get back at you
if no one had got ill i wouldn't have had an excuse would i it's great how things work out sometimes isn't it but then i've always been lucky like that how's your luck i've been to the doctor's again stoking things up
what do you want from me money
no i want nothing from you only for you to know that humiliating me was a bad idea
what did you say to her i gave her the facts about food poisoning she looks really upset so
come on to be honest doctor granger spent more time looking at himself than watching the road if only doctor fenton was available he'd be an excellent choice
could have saved me a lot of aggro so that's a no to doctor granger
doctor fenton isn't available
it wouldn't do for us to be in a confined space together
no nick
he's likely to be a nervous passenger no offence
archie then i don't think he likes the idea of more cars on the road i think you'll have to fork out and pay someone
hello what about me i'll do it i love driving s. club on the stereo we'll have a right laugh
yes i'll put you on my reserve list
you haven't got a reserve list have you no
i'm looking for someone with a more experience
come back to me in five years then clare rang from the deli she wants to come in later to see you don't worry i don't think it's product recall
did she say what it was about
she wouldn't say enjoy your rolls
hey
would i make a good driving instructor what oh nothing well no actually it's vivien she didn't give me a second thought and i'd make a really good driving instructor how dare she
yeah are you listening to me yeah sorry i've just had a bit of a morning that's all
no i just mean that whenever anyone comes in with a posh accent he always takes their side it does my head in yeah i can see that
so do you think i should say something to vivien ask her why she thinks i wouldn't make a good instructor
so we're back to your problem now
er no actually we never left my problem it's just that you railroaded it with talk of daniel and the class system all right
i think you've had a lucky escape with vivien who needs the pressures of teaching her how to drive
yeah you're right thanks archie have a good afternoon wait up nyee ow ergh
and how much will that be i see i'll call you back it's daylight robbery they're so expensive
it's probably a nerve racking job
it is but i've only got a few left to ring
no i meant oh never mind
this one's permanently engaged which means it's either very busy or it's gone out of business this one sounds welsh which isn't a problem in itself but if he has a very strong accent i might mishear the instructions and this one well i've had a report from a friend that he's a bit tactile if you know what i mean all right what
i'll do it if you promise to stop moaning on about everything i will take you out for one lesson all right oh unless you've had a better offer
ooh that would be lovely
i couldn't help but notice that you didn't give her the full hour
don't want to talk about it so all this because he made a pass at you
i was catering the event doing my job when towards the end of the evening when there weren't many people left that braying idiot started pawing me trying to impress his mates and i just went mad
understandably
i shouted at him and slapped him then i got out of there as fast as i could he came in this afternoon admitted it will it be enough to stop the investigation
it'll be enough to get him done for assault but whatever his motive all the people at the party ate the food and they were ill
couldn't it be something else
possibly but if they all ate the food it just seems like the obvious explanation
sorry archie could you
yeah excuse me help me please can you help me
the cramps won't go away he's got really bad stomach pains
oh come to spread more lies about my business
they're not lies we're ill because of you
is he your boyfriend that pillock of a medical student
don't you dare talk like that about him
you want to steer well clear
what's it to you
if he makes a pass make sure you hit him with something very heavy
shame sorry
no i should be saying that sorry i mean i can't do this any more what jeremy wanted you to think he still had the symptoms so before we came he took something to give him the stomach cramps and make him throw up do you know what it was i'm a media student and there's something else
that should ease the pain of the cramps we'll keep you in for now and see whether to send you to saint phil's later because of the amount of retching you may have a little tear in the mucous membrane which joins the oesophagus to the stomach
a mallory weiss tear
impressed yes
um something important's come up
what have you done
jeremy's taken something to make himself sick to exaggerate his symptoms
you idiot what have you taken jeremy this is serious ipecac
it's sometimes used on the wards to help induce vomiting and there's something else as well go on tell them what you told me
not all of us ate the food jeremy was certain the deli was to blame so he convinced us to go along with it said they wouldn't investigate her otherwise
why are you making this up
but only three people ate it i was ill and i didn't even have any i couldn't go on not when i saw how upset she was
it's a very serious thing lying to environmental health
and not when i realised why you were really doing it oh shut up
until we find a better explanation i'm going to carry on my campaign there's nothing you can do
well it's probably a matter for the police now and there is a better explanation your beach party club society what is it exactly a bunch of students vanload of sand then anywhere you go instant beach party
it's called having fun just listen for once in your life
archie what's your point
how many times did you re use the sand
we can't afford to chuck it
well then as medical men i'm sure we all know that sand can become contaminated
i made sandcastles
probably explains why you were ill without eating anything
i'll contact environmental health and tell them that some of the students were lying they might want to test the sand if they haven't already you don't believe all this do you
totally
what did he have to say for himself
well we'll have to wait for the test results but i think you may well be in the clear and it's up to you whether you decide to press charges or not
thanks
pleasure and daniel thank you
no problem
we haven't seen much of you this afternoon doctor clay
well i haven't felt very sociable
can i help
it's eva i don't know she's only just moved in and now i find out she's put the flat on the market does that seem a bit sudden depends if you feel rushed yeah yeah you're right there's a lot of crossing out
it's the price i don't know how many lessons i'm going to need i don't want to have to stop because i've run out of money
you should get a friend to teach you
could be right i should how are you fixed i don't want to force you i realise it's a decision that you've got to want to make and it's no use pushing somebody into doing something they don't want to do
i wish more people thought that way go on then i'll do it
really that's fantastic
pleasure we'll start tomorrow tomorrow too welsh eva
i've got news
yeah we've got fifteen viewings tonight and you'll have to buy me dinner to make up for it
oh it's all happening a bit fast
but we'll never be this lucky again
i just need a bit of time
seriously julia did the t. shirts have to be pink
you could get married don't look so shocked you're old enough
stop stop stop ooh i nearly crashed yeah i noticed
this is an addiction it's like being hooked on drink or drugs
oh there's davey davey hiya
nice top
thank you thank you thank you thank you so much hello and welcome to through the keyhole fascinating homes owned by fascinating personalities they're the keys to today's entertainment and the key holder as always is the lovely lisa snowdon
gosh that one is really really tough lots of work in progress so not too many clues downstairs where the general living goes on we've just seen the bedrooms and there were no clues there um family man it's definitely a man loves his kids haven't they got cracking bedrooms lots of themes about italy is he italian but i haven't got a clue what sort of field he works in at the moment i really don't
debra
there's something very fishy about this whole thing isn't there i think there might be because we have the bed in the shape of the boat and the fish on the wall the fish whoever this is really likes his fish mm so let's see now he's italian he's a male chef he's a family man he likes cooking fish
mm m. m. m. m.
any more ideas
oh dear i've got it have you
i think i've got it yeah we've got it
yes it's aldo zilli
yes isn't it
now i thought all the way you were going through you were absolutely right to think it sounds like aldo zilli but strangely enough it isn't ooh
that was just a red herring no
you got us stitched up like a kipper on this one
other italian chefs we need a clue
regular appearances on b. b. c. ready steady cook
tony regular appearances on that
that's the sort of picture of the man yes yes yeah
daytime chef primetime chef his intriguing background
he's also he's essentially italian as you said so if you switch on a programme and you expect to see an italian who knows about food and it's not aldo zilli who is it i think this one has got you i think we're stumped stumped
hook line and sinker
pardon you've got us hook line and sinker
it wasn't worth it the first time
he was born in torre del greco in napoli and his name is gino d'acampo
oh
so gino d'acampo will you come through the keyhole
how are you pleased to meet you i won't kiss you i'll shake your hand most kind
come and take a seat gino why is it that italian food is so popular
because italian food is very much like italian men minimum effort maximum satisfaction that's what i believe that's what my father wants me to believe anyway
how did you get into the food business i er
that's right talking about aldo zilli there are you passionate about fish as visiting your home makes it look are you particularly keen on cooking fish eating fish and all of that or not
i love fish but not as much as aldo does i think i'm more of a meat eater myself right also because unfortunately in this country you can't really get fresh fish all the time which is very upsetting there should be more fresh fish around
and is your house a work in progress as lisa said
yes it is a work in progress because we moved in about a year ago yeah and my wife convinced me that it would only take a couple of hundred thousand pounds to do it up so i said that's a good deal let's buy the house a couple of hundred thousand pounds and we'll do it up i was completely wrong because it only took me to the first floor we still have to do all the bottom and everything else
but then it will be finished it looks very good very good at the moment
why was britain particularly attractive to come to work here was it partially because we brits do love italian food or was it the natural place to come
it was the women to be really honest i rest my case look how beautiful i was seventeen i was seventeen and i went to work in spain to open a restaurant the waitresses in the restaurant were all english so was my wife because she was working there as well i actually had never seen a blonde girl with beautiful eyes and because i'm used to dark women hairy usually so that's true so i was amazed to see this blonde hair you know and i said that's it i want to go to england that's the place to go
a very very good reason and to prepare yourself for this experience you had also worked in sylvester stallone's mambo king restaurant
yes in marbella was that yes it was in puerto banus i was asked to go from the school to open his restaurant a great experience a very very great experience i met the guy a couple of times he's not as big as people think no he isn't
that's true he's quite a short guy a bit like alan ladd indeed your english is so good that you're writing your own books now
yes i just finished my first book which was out last october and i'm writing the second one at the moment yes
so if england were playing italy at soccer who would you cheer for
that's a good compromise that's good although you have a beautiful
yes we're all italians now that's right what a joy to have you with us gino and this is our key the through the keyhole key which says thanks a million for being with us
thank you for inviting me thank you very much gino a million thanks thank you thank you
our thanks to gino there and now let's join lisa we join her at house number two remember the clues are there as we go through the keyhole
there's something rather special about central london apartments outside just a few feet away is chelsea and that's an amazing place people dress up to go shopping after all you have to be seen in the right clothes it was as if they were appearing on a film set or on location for television but in here away from the hustle and bustle all is calm quiet and extremely elegant there's something quite theatrical about this little tableau here this rather beautiful bronze lady holding aloft this torch lighting up this fabulous painting i love the wine the half eaten apple the cheese but i am quite surprised there's not a coffee cup in there somewhere what a grand entrance to this well how do i describe it a salon no not the hair salon that wouldn't cut it but this is somewhere you could hold a soiree i could imagine lovely ladies sitting chatting and perhaps waiting for a gentleman caller and i think that's about as far as my imagination had better go mm very elegant isn't it beautiful things everywhere there's art there's obviously a very strong interest in art and there's a wonderful set of shakespeare's works there's a script being read as much as i'd like to tell you what it's all about it's got confidential stamped all over it it seems very good though a picture might paint a thousand words but it's good to have some soothing music while you work your way into the night something like aznavour or some italian music while you sip your coffee in an attempt to stay awake and inspired there's more than a passing interest in art this person is an artist and a very good one i wish i could paint and draw handy if you've ever had to have anything to do with hospitals you'd know where the appendix was if you had to help in casualty let's take a look at the clues again the script the salon and the art who lives in a house like this david it's over to you
thank you very much indeed lisa now for our home and studio audience here's whose house it is william
a delightful residence absolutely delightful clearly a very talented person living there i really loved the art on the wall and the pictures and then you see the art that this person produces obviously someone who likes to stay awake a lot this business about coffee but i don't know what that is
debra
at first i thought this person might be a writer because it's obviously somebody who's into literature and art and with a script there it would have to be a writer or an actress and i'm thinking that the coffee might have been a coffee advert
oh oh but of course there was a big hint about casualty
but i don't think she's in casualty i think that would be too obvious
yes i think it's just the anatomy i think it's another medical programme that she might be in who's done the coffee ad recently it's that isn't it yeah it's that
she's also er i'm trying to think
a great actress yes and
i'm trying to phrase this diplomatically um of the more mature generation so there was no jukebox or
a woman with great taste really refined and elegant exceptional elegance and beauty she is beautiful as well
i'm wondering i know it we're very hung up on this coffee business
yes it's a question of how recent the coffee commercial was mm
would it have been the one with the very famous series from some years ago
ooh was it who do you think it was was it cherie lunghi
yes cherie lunghi it is indeed cherie lunghi will you come through the keyhole
thank you thank you thank you welcome hello
hello
the coffee did it in the end it always does
all that hard work on the stage all that drama school and it's always the coffee every time
learning two hour parts i know learning lady macbeth and everything
but i'm not knocking it no absolutely
it was gold blend wasn't it no it wasn't can we brand name here yes debra said it was gold blend
i thought it was people always confuse it it was kenco kenco
yes it does get confused with the richness yes
how many years did you do it for
ten years ten years fantastic it was fantastic yes it was great especially for an actor to have a lovely pillow of work an income like that my daughter was growing up then so it meant i didn't have to run round the country pursuing work i could be a little more choosy and be home and be a mother that was a luxury you know
your daughter is going into it too she is already she's been in the palace
she's working away following in my footsteps
the palace theatre not the palace theatre not buckingham palace no
people sometimes say they're worried about people i bet you're delighted she's
i am actually for a long time i had nerves about it as most actors do it's such a difficult profession all the rejection but i see how much she loves it and she's starting to have some successes she's getting work and she's passionate no one could have stopped me from doing it and i've had a wonderful life doing what i do a really fascinating life
did you nearly do anything else i nearly painted it was a bit of a toss up between the two early on
but then i always loved performing because i loved ballet as well
but painting is becoming more important again
it always has been but now i have time to pursue it i can do little courses and attend drawing classes and i keep my hand in more
in terms of dynasties yes you lived in that house with your mother yes i did now your daughter lives with you there too
exactly we moved in there years ago and we rented it and then i was in a position to buy it about fifteen years ago my mother continued to live in it with my aunt they're deceased god rest their souls then i did a little job on it it only had one radiator so i thought it was time to update it
did you change it as they say structurally a little bit
i knocked a couple of walls down to make a bigger kitchen we used to go to the launderette but you can't anymore it's closed so you have to have all the appliances so you need a bigger kitchen i didn't want to destroy the fabric of it or make it unrecognisable as the flat that i grew up in because it's got some wonderful it's got a lovely atmosphere and great memories for me
we saw the atmosphere if you can see atmosphere what are the real landmarks of your life and career cherie excalibur yes that was that was the first big movie
yes that was my first movie with john boorman i went to ireland and filmed with liam neeson and gabriel byrne and helen mirren who i'd worked with previously at the royal court so that was a huge step up in terms of my career certainly but earlier even than that my big ambition coming out of drama school and working in rep was to join the royal shakespeare company because that was like my university really cutting my teeth as an actor
when you went there was trevor nunn there
i worked with trevor nunn john barton a shakespeare scholar i learnt an enormous amount about shakespeare from him i worked with judi dench ian mckellen i had the opportunity to stand in the wings and learn my craft watching these people and rehearsing with them
what have been the landmarks in television
the manageress i think i worked steadily in all sorts of interesting dramas but i think the manageress was the one that really put me on the map yeah on the map yes
and what would you like to do in the future
i never think about that not anymore i used to run after different goals i've done that now i want this i had a hankering ambition for things it's wonderful to be able to say that i'm actually quite happy with things as they are as long as i've got time to paint as well i can balance the two loves of my life
and was the trip was it three or four years that you nipped off to hollywood
four years was that a good idea yes it was it was i did a series out there and my daughter's father lives there so it was an opportunity for her to see more of him i'd sort of always wanted to do it and flirted with it and not really committed to it previously because of interesting work here i'm glad i got it out of my system it was an interesting experience too
coming up i read here we'll be seeing you appropriately enough in something called we know what a touch of frost yes that's what i'm working on currently on its way yeah on its way zooming your way even at the moment here is the through the keyhole key i forgot i get a key it's been a delight to have you lovely i'm sorry we mixed up the two coffees but it's easy to do
there are so many we've talked about important things too
here is the through the keyhole key to say thanks a million for being here
thank you very much thank you
what does earl grey a bag of salt and vinegar crisps and the world's first tilting bridge have in common they all come from the north east and so do we today welcome to flog it welcome to newcastle today we're in newcastle and our venue is the metro radio arena this venue is used to hosting huge rock and pop concerts ice hockey basketball even show jumping today it's playing host to flog it and all these people are here to ask that one important question and what is it what's it worth so we'd better get them inside and find out the arena is filling up fast and our experts kate bliss and anita manning are already straight in searching for the best items
no no
not in our times tell me where did you get this
my aunt was the manageress in a cleaner's and he used to come in and bring his clothing in his wife wanted some alterations doing and mum was a seamstress so she started doing the alterations so they got to know each other quite well and then we were in as children one day and we got to meet him and it was just a nicety so reg smythe did this cartoon
for you personally yes he did originally these cartoons were done for the daily mirror just for northern readers
right they didn't think southerners would appreciate the humour
it's lovely but in the decor there's nowhere to put it so it lives in the wardrobe
andy capp lives in the wardrobe well there are many feminists who think that's where he should be put and not brought out so it's not on display
no it's not on display which is a shame
it's not worth an enormous amount of money although i would call it a speculative piece i don't know exactly how much it's worth leanne but i would like to put it in with an estimate of perhaps forty to sixty would you feel happy at that
yes that's no problem
it's wonderful to see this type of item because it is a local piece being sold in a local auction so let's hope that it'll do well because of that and i hope that you'll be happy
lovely shall we put it to auction yes please let's go for it thank you
what made you bring this along today
we're trying to find out the name of it and everything and we couldn't
well nothing really
do you like it yes i like it
i thought it will go to my daughter but she said she would put it in a cupboard and not use it
i quite agree with you and i'm a bit dubious that i won't get my price for it
what sort of figure were you think of for it well i was thinking at least it was four hundred at least four hundred yeah then you get your commission so you're not getting four hundred auction houses charge commission
they charge it so i'd rather keep it than let it go for next to nothing
let's have a closer look at it then i'll tell you what i think this sort of glass is known as iridescent glass because it's got this beautiful sheen on it almost metallic lustre and there were two leading manufacturers of this type of glass a company called lowetts in austria and then their rival the other big producer was louis comfort tiffany across the atlantic in america
and it was really a phenomenon of that period the turn of the nineteenth century and very much a product of the art nouveau period this type of shape and decoration typically incorporated art nouveau motifs such as this lovely floral design but this enamelling here is lovely it's really nice quality that's laid onto the glass there and typical sort of art nouveau decoration with long sinuous stems and then flowers and almost sort of lilypad shaped leaves another typical motif you said you wanted to find out who made it yes i can't tell you exactly who this is by in fact a lot of iridescent glass was never marked so it's very difficult to trace and pinpoint to a particular factory in terms of value i think it's a very attractive piece and this deep purple glass particularly is very popular yes but at auction i'd like to put an estimate of two hundred to three hundred on it i think your four hundred might be pushing it a little bit i think two hundred to three hundred would certainly encourage people and i hope we might reach your four hundred but i think if we estimate it at that it might put people off a bit are you happy to sell it at that
lovely right thanks louise i absolutely love taxidermy and every victorian or edwardian home with aspirations of grandeur would have had taxidermy in it something like this to display to show to their friends because it was the victorians that really had a thirst for knowledge and discovery and education and they wanted to show everybody what they'd got it was a great learning tool taxidermy so how did you come by the red squirrels they came from my father
he inherited them from his granny when he passed away they came to me
and he wasn't a collector of taxidermy no up until about five years ago i wasn't and now i've started collecting it yeah i have found a beauty in it because i think taxidermy at its best is art form you have to be a lover of animals to be able to make them look right they were consummate artists taxidermists these animals actually had to be skinned their bones were taken out and all the fat was scraped off the flesh then the flesh was brought back the skull was left in shape with the mouth it would then have a wire frame made for it and put inside the skin the wire frame would have been covered in a wadding the skin would've been coated in a borax acid to preserve it glass eyes were added for authenticity papier mache sometimes to build up the mouth and the tongue and to be painted we've got two squirrels playing in a naturalistic setting with their hazelnuts in a wooded area if they were new squirrels we wouldn't sell them if this was done last week but this dates back to about nineteen hundred nineteen ten it is early edwardian i can tell it's that old because the case is that old and it's never been opened it's never been removed there's no new nails and this incidentally the putting around the edge the victorians or edwardians wouldn't have used putty they'd have used a plaster and disguised it to look like putty or painted over it and this is what this is this is a very hard plaster i think that's lovely it's not everybody's cup of tea and people are going oh my god he's gone off his rocker but they do sell right squirrels i don't know if they'll be that popular obviously stuffed pheasants foxes birds in particular fish fetch big big big money a couple of little squirrels like this i would expect to get around about one hundred twenty really that much eighty to one hundred twenty let's go for the top end
tremendous you don't want to take them home i don't like them
that's it you either love or hate them
in truth not a lot not a lot it looks basic it looks basic it's not a mona lisa or nowt like that you'd like the mona lisa aye but we couldn't find it
where did it come from
i found it last week in my nana's house just last week she's in ill health we wanted to clear some stuff out to move her and we found this in the attic
so if you thought it was pretty basic what made you hold on to it and bring it along today
because it looks old and it's got pins in the top just looks old
it is fairly old yes i would date it anywhere between one thousand eight hundred eighty five and nineteen hundred perhaps have you done any research on the artist we have got a signature
i had a quick look on the internet i found he died in nineteen thirty nine if it's the same fellow he was a local artist that's all i know
well if you're right and the signature certainly suggests there f. slater then this picture would be attributed to a john falconer slater who you are exactly right is a local artist to northumbria and newcastle he was based here and in fact did most of his exhibiting here around tyneside and in his own area and he did a lot of landscapes working mostly in oils but he was best known in fact for his moods of the sea pictures and in fact it's what made him one of the best northern impressionist painters we can see here from the start of this landscape it is very impressionist when you look at it closely the colours at the moment are very autumnal that's because it needs a jolly good clean
i thought it looked a bit brown
which might contribute to the fact you thought it looks quite old but it is actually pretty filthy and with very careful cleaning a good restorer could bring it up and you'd see the picture in a completely different light the whole tone of the picture would be changed but if you want to sell it it's best you leave it exactly how it is the purchaser can make up his mind and clean it the way he sees fit do you like it any better no it still looks dull i don't know what i'm looking at so you're quite happy to flog it it's for my nana's sake
she's moving house into a bungalow any little bit helps really
so we need to raise as much money as we can for her yes please i'm going to be fairly conservative about this one because i don't think it's one of his best i'll estimate it at auction at two hundred to three hundred perhaps with a reserve at just under two hundred perhaps one hundred eighty to give the auctioneer a bit of discretion
whatever you think that's brilliant
it's been hectic here in newcastle here's the first batch of antiques ready to go off to auction we're in the right town for it so let's hope for a couple of andy capp collectors to push the price up on leanne's cartoon i'm confident the bidders will love the graceful lines of the art nouveau vase my choice next the red squirrels which have been out of fashion but are now back in vogue and the local painting it may not be the mona lisa but it should do well we have now moved south of the tyne to the bolden auction galleries where our auctioneer giles hodges is taking a look at andy and flo this has got to do well local interest here
very much so reg smythe is a local artist wrote for the daily mirror surprised the lady wants to sell it
well leanne brought it in she's had a valuation of forty fifty sixty maximum i wouldn't sell it if i was her it is a lovely bit of memorabilia but what's going to let it down it will sell it will make its money quite easily but it's got her name on it you don't what that if someone signs an autograph it should be best wishes reg smythe as soon as you put somebody's name on it how many other leannes are there that it would fit
and who would want it as well it's a big problem but as you said the estimate placed on it i think quite confidently it will sell
when i say a lot of local interest is it something that you've come across a lot of do we see these cartoons up here
i've been based in the north east for seven years and have never had anything with andy capp
so it is quite rare it is indeed yes fingers crossed on this one this one could be a surprise it could be indeed hopefully there'll be two people in here that want this both called leanne hopefully yes we have a lovely art nouveau glass vase going under the hammer now a lovely iridescent purple valued two hundred to three hundred but winifred its owner she's put the value up haven't you you've now fixed a reserve at kate's high end kate our expert put two hundred to three hundred on it you've now put a fixed reserve of three hundred
i've had it that long and it's old and in perfect condition
it is in superb condition
winifred you were in two minds whether to sell it or not
i told you that we once found out that three hundred to four hundred so that was why i thought no
but markets do change i'm not saying it won't make that but to encourage the bidding two hundred to three hundred is a fair estimate
what would you put the money towards more holidays
no i think i need new blinds
new blinds for the house winifred has just come back from benidorm two weeks on holiday in the sun and now she's freezing cold here
i was sitting down the front and it was very cold
let's hope we get three hundred fifty four hundred if not it's going home
she's putting her fingers up good luck it's going under the hammer now
two hundred seventy the lutz style iridescent purple glass tapering vase i'm bid two hundred to start at two hundred two hundred twenty two hundred forty at two hundred forty two hundred sixty now at two hundred forty two hundred sixty two hundred eighty three hundred on my right at three hundred twenty anybody at three hundred for the last time at three hundred
yes three hundred your top end and your bottom end you were right you were both right new blinds for the house three hundred for the blinds i've had my holidays where are you starting the bedrooms or lounge it's for the front of the house
we got new ones in the back it's the front
are you pleased it's gone
the piece has gone yes
it's a sad moment remember that lovely original cartoon andy capp a bit of local interest here that was brought in to the valuation by leanne unfortunately she can't be with us but her mum can what's your name margaret margaret why is she selling this it's signed to leanne as well
it's just been stuck in the wardrobe for years forty to sixty
i'd keep it for that
i wouldn't sell
very difficult paul to estimate something like that it's an original work it's signed it's of local interest but it's also signed so it was a stab in the dark it's also signed to leanne which does put a lot of people off
i wouldn't have that on my wall with leanne best wishes that's the problem we need two bidders in the room called leanne that's what we need
original cartoon by andy capp by reg smythe i'm bid twenty to start it straight in at twenty twenty two twenty five twenty eight thirty thirty thirty thirty two at thirty two on my left at thirty two we're away at thirty two
yes he's put the hammer down thirty two it's sold just over the reserve of thirty
the main thing is if she wasn't interested in it and it was stuck on top of a shelf put it on the market let someone who is interested in it enjoy it
she'll be pleased with that won't she oh yes she can treat herself to a meal out or treat mum a few drinks down the pub for all you art lovers we've got a lovely oil painting brought in by ray two hundred to three hundred is what kate our expert has put on it it's a lovely impressionistic thing it's quite loose beautiful colours but it's not your thing no no but it certainly was when he found it in the attic nan's attic he thought yes let's take it along to flog it
and i end up standing here
exactly here we are in the auction room two hundred to three hundred did you think it was worth that no no it's a nice surprise we're getting good prices here today so if two people fall in love with this it could push it a bit more fingers crossed let's hope so it's going under the hammer now
landscape i'm bid two hundred to start me two hundred two hundred twenty two hundred forty at two hundred forty two hundred sixty now at two hundred forty at two hundred forty it's against you
come on a bit more
at two hundred forty for the last time at two hundred forty
right two hundred forty what's nan going to spend the money on
she's just moved into a bungalow so it'll pay the expenses
she's downsizing a bit
aye making it easier to look after herself
hopefully you're going to look after her i'll have to won't i
well done you for bringing it along because if you hadn't
it would have been chucked away
exactly yes lost for the new owners in a skip somewhere now it's my turn to be the expert and the pressure is on we've got two red squirrels a bit of taxidermy going under the hammer louise has also turned up in red as well which is quite fitting isn't it not deliberately let's hope that's a lucky omen we've got a packed saleroom let's hope they're into stuffed animals yes they're quite rare as long as there's at least two people who want them your dad's taken you to lots of auctions before hasn't he
yes yes
now i'm feeling rather worried because there's only one other item of taxidermy here so let's hope the collectors are here shall we
yes this is it it's going under the hammer now the edwardian taxidermy of two squirrels climbing on the branches we do have a certificate from defra so we are allowed to sell them i'm bid fifty to start them at fifty five sixty five seventy at seventy anybody else
come on seventy five eighty at eighty
five it's downstairs at eighty five anybody else left at eighty five and all done at eighty five
we did it just in the estimate
yes eighty to one hundred twenty phew that was close wasn't it
had to forage a bit deeper there that was good though i'm pleased eighty five what's that going to go towards
towards a holiday where are you going i haven't decided yet but i think i'll take my mum my dad would have approved of that oh that's nice seeing as they were his take mum away and cheer her up
well some good results so far but don't forget there's plenty more auction action to come later on in the show but right now it's time for me to nip back over the tyne to newcastle to find out a bit more about some local recent history nowadays newcastle's teesside is a vibrant area brimming with character and life this area is one of the oldest parts of the toon and it was the commercial hub of tyneside for many centuries but by the nineteen seventies it became incredibly rundown and the rents well they were very cheap as well and that's when a film making co operative called amber films moved in they're still here today and murray martin is one of the founding members murray what was this area like when you moved in
well visually it wasn't radically that much different in some ways because it still feels dominated by victorian buildings but they were much greyer and satanic that they are now and it was an area which was doomed there was a sort of mythology about the quayside which said don't go there
don't go at night it's dangerous it's full of prostitutes and criminals
and you'll get mugged which was never true in our experience
but there's a lot of vitality in an area like that and that sort of area would attract artists like you
well it's great romance in a way and also they are the areas which are also historically cheap there's a relationship between cheapness and freedom which is important we used to rent these buildings a cottage for one pound week three pounds for the middle floor two pounds for the top two floors six quid a week we had a huge area you couldn't get that now
no you couldn't so you found out and you realised that the council had a lot of big plans a lot of development for the quayside
we found that the council had got an agreement with property developers to demolish the whole of the east of the quayside and we were quite shocked by this and we felt the least we've got to do is try to do something about it
how did you react did you want to make something that provoked
well we see ourselves as creative individuals who are feeling and documenting an area so we thought the best way to raise the issue was to make a film and with that film begin to raise a discussion
dear sir i am seeking employment as an engineer on one of your home trade
when i started in nineteen fifty four this river was choc a bloc with ships the coal trade you know the tyne was built from coal with the coal went the traditional business'
there was a boat left of kirkcaldy every week and came down here with six to seven hundred tonnes
this was alive with business it was always full of ships'
what we did was we made the film the b. b. c. became interested in it having documented what the quayside was like we got involved with the times architectural correspondent came to the debate i remember and he was appalled to discover the plans about the future of the quayside so consequently we had a mysterious phone call saying you can list any building you want here's the phone number of the doe they'll list any building you say and that's what we began to do
fantastic so what form did the film take did you want to sort of ignite a lot of debate and spark off interest
yes i think first of all we set out to make a poetic documentary short sixty millimetre black and white film which recorded or expressed in a way what we felt about the quayside about the area and we felt if you did it in that way at least then you can have an open discussion you're not telling people what to think you're not telling them what to do so we decided on a very simple form we got a rear engined car took the bonnet off put the cameraman under the bonnet and we drove around the quayside so a lot of shots show you driving straight up to somebody and they don't even know what's going on there's a huge number of tracking shots the film was almost continuous movement we also had in tangent with this film done photography two great photographers worked with us they documented almost everybody who worked on the quayside so we had a complete record brilliant so we did an exhibition and we did the film and with that we began to raise this discussion about what should happen to this area and that of course then led to the idea of should the council be knocking it down it revealed that and gateshead councillors have told me since that if they'd have knocked the quayside down you couldn't have had the baltic you couldn't have had the sage because it's part of a whole feeling of an area yeah so if you make those mistakes you can never retrieve them
well you've seen yourself the architecture change and the superstructure of the buildings what about the community and the population has that demised
yes and boring
so whatever one thinks about it i have my own likes and dislikes at least most of the buildings were saved and it's got a great feeling a great vitality
thank you very much i've had a great time i love the film and it's guys like you and the cinema project here that have really not just recorded the social history here but you've also helped preserve it so that's a good thing now back to the valuation day where anita's found something from close to home
dawn welcome to flog it and thank you for bringing this bonny item along do you know what it is
a paisley shawl but i don't know much about its origin
do you know where paisley is
i don't no you don't know where paisley is
paisley is a town just outside glasgow now this is a lovely item made in the nineteenth century they came from kashmir at the beginning of the nineteenth century the early eighteen hundreds and it became the most wonderful fashion accessory women wore them as they would an overcoat round their big dresses they were made all over europe but the very best of them dawn was made in paisley near glasgow and these people from paisley used to travel down to london to see the boats coming in so that they could steal the latest kashmiri designs anyway let's have a closer look at it let's stand up here let's open it up and show it in its full glory oh look at that these wonderful colours the reds oranges yellows and browns and these stylised leaf shapes here do you like it dawn
yeah i love it the detail's really detailed and it's lovely
because it's machine made it's not as valuable as the ones which were hand made the earlier ones so i would like to keep my estimate in the region of say sixty to eighty
right would you be happy to sell it yeah
it's still enough money to be able to put towards what you want to do
isn't that gorgeous it's so rich and exotic but not your style tell me where you got this lovely item
it actually belonged to my grandmother and it was passed down to me by my mam
but you have a particular reason for selling it
yeah i'm gonna put the money towards a horsebox
tell me your horse's name dawn she's called pandora's legend ah that's a beautiful name is she some special type of horse
she is she's an anglo arab she's a show jumper do you jump with her as well yeah i do so the money is going to something that will suit your lifestyle yes
right do you feel all right about that yeah well we'll put it to auction i'll be there with you
and i really hope that it does well so that pandora's
legend legend will be happy in her new horsebox
we've got a lovely little collection here did this all come from the same place
no it didn't actually first of all this little trio of the plate and the saucer and the cup i was at an antiques fair in york and they just sort of jumped out at me i think this lovely horse movement and the red and white also cos i must admit even though we're in newcastle i am a sunderland supporter
the red and white sort of jumped at you very much so
and i had them in my kitchen i love them a lot and then a few years later i was in an antiques fair in gateshead and surprise surprise i saw the same pattern and it jumped out at me again and so i bought it in two sections
and you like the horse pattern as well
it's something about the movement of it i don't know it's a bit abstract but it just caught the eye
i can see what you mean cos if we just look at the saucer here the way that the two horses are sort of on top of each other to suggest that movement from one position to the other is rather nice isn't it
the legs are almost they're sort of very sharp and you can get the idea of a plunging forward movement yes and a little bit greek perhaps like the ancient greek artwork
yes absolutely so that's what appealed
it did and it was just the pattern i knew nothing about it
what did you pay can you remember
i can't quite remember but i think probably between fourteen and sixteen for the pair of those together
that'd be nice yes yes thank you
so you're not sad to see it go
no although i love the pattern but it is sitting in a box in my house and it isn't being used and so perhaps somebody else will be attracted to it and will love it more than i am at present perhaps lesley this is a lovely blackcurrant sweetie i love it do you know what it is
you are a woman did you pay a lot of money at the time
i thought it was a lot of money but it couldn't have been more than a fiver i don't think
all i can say is that it was a good buy was it oh good it was a good buy now it is whitefriars one of the prestigious glassmakers they always made items of quality not only did they make quality products they employed the best of designers
who was one of the most prestigious designers of the twentieth century this is what is hot
now price wise you paid a fiver for it lesley
about that yeah if i offered you a fiver for it now would you take it no i don't think so and you'd be quite right you would be quite right
now you bought it for your folks it's in your possession now do you have it on display
no it's just in the spare room
so it's doing nothing no well in that case it's time to pass it on i would estimate it in the region of five hundred to seven hundred how much five hundred to seven hundred well i'm very very surprised it's as much as that
i didn't have any idea at all it would be worth that much amount of money but very nice a very nice surprise yes
would you be happy with it selling at that price
i'm sure yes very happy
i wonder what the bidders are going to make of our lots here's a quick recap of what we're taking to auction will the fact that it's machine made hold back dawn's paisley shawl i'm sure the ever popular beswick tea set is a definite sale and anita's rightly excited with this very unusual whitefriars banjo vase so we're off to the auction house let's see if auctioneer giles feels the same way the classic the iconic geoffrey baxter banjo vase a bit of whitefriars here we do get a lot of whitefriars on the show and i know your saleroom's a hot spot for sort of twentieth century antiques isn't it
we do sell twentieth century glass very well indeed again for the collector's market this particular colour if somebody hasn't got it it should make its estimate
and on the general interest we have had from telephones that have come through in the last couple of days we should hit the estimate quite comfortably whether it makes above that depends on the day that's its money yes it is i would have thought so good old geoffrey baxter
it's like a doorstop it is so heavy they are they're brilliant right remember that paisley shawl well it's just about to go under the hammer and we need fifty to sixty hopefully but unfortunately its owner dawn cannot be with us today she's taking her exams so good luck and i hope you pass them with flying colours but i am joined by anita our expert that put the valuation on we need the top end because you know the money is going towards that horsebox
yeah i think i've geared it just at the right level you have if it had been a hand made one
oh double it so it's just about the right place
i think that it's low value for the item
and i'd love to own it and i know you would and it looks stunning over there
lot number two hundred forty five is a victorian machine made paisley shawl and i'm bid thirty to start it thirty five forty five fifty five fifty five sixty now at fifty five sixty anybody come on a bit more a bit more all done at fifty five yes fifty five quid
that's going towards the horsebox
it was just about right it was spot on
well we've got some beswick it's a set of beswick and we're looking at forty sixty seventy hopefully
hopefully top end why are you flogging this lot it isn't on display at the minute it's something i have got away in a box upstairs and it seemed somebody else might put it on display it might match their decor
there's a little bit of damage but it's only staining
a little bit of yellowy brown
you'd expect that with preserves
yeah yeah i think if you've got a retro kitchen this is really something to buy and i think it's something that's going to keep creeping up in the antiques market
it's got the look and it's functional
i bought it cos i liked the design
beswick wild horses breakfast set with the silhouetted horses i'm bid ten to start it at ten fifteen twenty five thirty five forty at forty take the five at forty are you all done forty five front row come on a bit more a bit more a bit more and we're away at forty five
the hammer's gone down forty five nevertheless it's gone it's sold what's that forty five quid going towards i know it's not a lot of money but what would you do with it
it might go towards another little collectible i collect sort of bevan oh do you black horses with white design on so it will go on one of those
ooh ooh i like that straight in at nine hundred
it's one thousand one hundred fifty the commission's out at one thousand one hundred fifty for the last time at one thousand one hundred fifty
one thousand one hundred fifty less a bit of commission what are you gonna spend that on
it's gonna go towards a holiday where where where
buy quality buy quality
she's going on holiday she's not gonna spend it on antiques
we're going to go to russia we want to go back to russia
do you what is special about russia
we just like it there you just love it there i collect malachite which we can get there and my husband's quite keen on icons yeah so you know hopefully we might be able to speculate
a love bug hits the animal park and these amorous anteaters seem to have caught it
and poo what a stinker we find out why rhino dung holds a secret message
hello and welcome to another exciting edition of roar
get my breath back i'm rani and that's milo he's a two year old male barbary lion here at port lympne
you can usually identify male lions from their handsome manes but milo hasn't reached maturity so he's got a bit of work to do on the mane growing department
when barbary lion manes grow it really does grow their mane is round their head on their chest and down to their stomachs
that's a hair raising fact and we've got loads more of those coming up on today's show we start over at howletts wild animal park where they're having a summer of love everywhere you look the animals are getting soppy and romantic the snow leopards are enjoying a snuggle the kudus are cosying up and the anteaters have gone one better and have moved in with one another in the wild anteaters are solitary animals they meet mate and go on their own separate ways which makes these guys living together truly remarkable and their love affair all the more special keeper alice elliott has been watching the relationship develop
how do you tell if an anteater is in love does he say it with chocolates flowers poetry no these furries prefer to wrestle
you don't see it very often but they do play fight sometimes roll about chase each other round you can tell when it's friendly and when it's not it's is just like a couple of kids playing around they're enjoying each other's company and they eat out of the same bowl as well they get two food bowls so they don't have to but normally they go to the same bowl when they come in in the evening they'll have their dinner out the same bowl stand side by side both snouts in the trough just slurping
so they share a bed like an affectionate wrestle and enjoy a romantic bowl of slop together what's next for these two lovebirds head of section joel has his suspicions
they were seen mating nearly six months ago so with a bit of luck within four to six weeks she could possibly give birth we don't know she's pregnant for definite it's very hard to tell they're very hairy so have a lot of weight gain and development of teats and that sort of thing we don't really know we're just guessing at the moment and hoping
so just how can you tell if an anteater is pregnant i'll give you a clue you call the fire brigade we'll be back later in the show to find out why
how do you make a siberian tiger work for his dinner on the other end of this ladder chris our big cat keeper seems to have a good idea chris we're in the tiger enclosure aren't we right now yes indeed where are the tigers
you're perfectly safe they're in the shut off area just over here no need to worry at all it's all locked and we're safe yes
we have a ladder with us you've some meat with you what are we actually doing today
we're going to put the feed up there
this isn't a real tree is it this part here is just a telegraph pole
that we put into the ground we're only going to put one piece of meat up here and then we're going to put another piece up one of these trees here the reason being is that tug does not like to go up trees ingrid doesn't like to go up the telegraph pole so we have to put one piece up each so they both go up they're fussy
you've got the meat shall i hold this ladder for you
yes please as i climb up it if you can stand at the bottom there make sure it's safe that will be great
up he goes will tug see you doing this now and will he be eager to run up
they're both at the fence there so they've both seen this they know exactly what we're doing do you tie it on we've these pegs so it hangs over hopefully it will stay there
why would you put their dinner up there because that seems a bit mean
it's not that they don't actually like climbing trees it's just that they don't do it all the prey they chase after is on the ground they don't need to there have been a couple of cases of people running away from the tigers in the wild and climbing up the tree to get away from them and the tiger followed them up it and they didn't actually get away at all it's a bit scary it's a bit scary
i can't believe he's making me carry the ladder what a gentleman
how about up this one that looks good to me
this is for ingrid it is yes who's the most agile out of the pair
ingrid by far normally when we let her out she comes bounding over and runs up the tree as if it's not there tug he looks all around the closure thinking i don't want to have to go up there he looks to see if we've put any anywhere else and eventually resigns himself to it
siberian tigers from siberia i'm guessing eastern russia it's quite cold there isn't it it's very cold so this environment
is perfect for them we get nice cold winters here not as cold as siberia but it's still very nice for them it means they're not going to be hot and flustered all the time and also during our summers they just lay down throughout the daytime staying cool
are we all set up there chris yeah i think we should get out of here and let the tigers out you come back later in the show to find out what happens
what's a slug i don't know a snail with a housing problem
i don't get it
what happened to the frog when it broke down it got toad away
what kind of dog likes to take bubble baths a sham poodle
i'm inside the tapier enclosure with deputy head of hoof stock stuart jones we've come over to help with some rhino enrichment what are we doing here
what we're going to do is collect some poo from these guys the tapiers
can i stop you there yeah collect some poo collect some poo what exactly are we doing that for
what we're going to do is place it in the rhino enclosure and hopefully the scent of these guys poo will stimulate some sort of behaviour out of them
that will be fascinating
we're going to get some of your poo all right over here there's a big pile over here have you put that poo there or is this a habit for them
these particular tapiers form a midden
a midden is a word for a large pile of poo in the wild it often marks the edge of an animals' territory
which is very similar to what rhinos do a lot of times they'll go in the water as well but these guys they form their middens it's easier for us to collect from here than from the middle of the pond
you feed them some banana and i'll dig up some poo while you distract them this is heavy stuff d'you know what it doesn't smell that bad
it's not too bad actually is it tapiers are vegetarians so their poo is not that smelly obviously if we were collecting carnivore poo where they eat meat that's really smelly
have we got enough there if we get a couple of scoops
we should be able to take it away
one more shovel full that's a pretty serious bucket of poo will that do yes great stuff join us later and we'll find out what the black rhino make of their smelly enrichment surprise
something's happened at howletts wild animal park and the fire brigade have been called kent's finest are on their way to the anteater house though fortunately it's not cos of a fire earlier we heard how the flames of love had been found between two anteaters called mr. and mrs. louie firefighter scott pearce and his team are here in answer to a burning question
we're white watch canterbury we're based at the local fire station in the city we've come along today to hopefully use our thermal image camera to ascertain whether or not the female giant anteater is pregnant
the thermal image camera is the latest fire fighting technology when pointed at an area it can detect even a tiny temperature difference if mrs. louie is pregnant the baby inside should be a few degrees warmer than she is pointing the camera at her belly could reveal a baby anteater shaped hot spot but what it usually used for
generally we use it to try and ascertain at a fire if there are any hot spots anywhere once fire fighting operations are over we send guys in with the thermal image camera and check to see if there are any hot spots we need to extinguish it is very valuable to take into the fire if somebody is missing we can use that equipment to find their body temperature in maybe a dark smoke filled room and then we can go straight to them and rescue them in nearly twelve years of being a firefighter it's the first time we've come to the zoo for any call out especially to find out if somebody is pregnant
it must be the first time these anteaters have seen so many firemen keeper joel can't wait to get started
both anteaters are asleep so we'll be able to walk straight up to them point the equipment at them and get a shot of their insides hopefully we'll compare the male and female hopefully what the male might lack the female might have inside of her and we'll be able to tell that way these are our two giant anteaters the female is the one on the left and the male there just woken up
picking up zero point two three degrees and that one there twenty two degrees
can you see any hot spots there
heads and the noses are showing up as red on the camera
what we really need are hot spots on the body itself
park vet jane is keen to find out what the camera reveals
hello joel how are the anteaters doing they're sleepy
if she was pregnant how far along would she be
from the matings that we've seen she should be a month maybe six weeks at the most is there any kind of comparison with the male
both pretty much the same
unfortunately time has run out the firemen have been called away to deal with an emergency
it wasn't conclusive we don't really know any more it doesn't rule her out being pregnant because it was quite an experimental thing she could be quite heavily pregnant and it just wouldn't show up definitely worth doing very interesting but frustratingly we still don't know
so if this extraordinary love affair has produced a baby it's a secret the two anteaters are keeping to themselves we'll be back later in the series with any news
have you been playing the roar game on the cbbc website the idea is to maintain and run the best possible wild animal park
every day we give you a secret code to unlock special features and today's code is on the screen now happy gaming
now some of the cutest animals of the park are these black and white lemurs but how much do you know about them we've assembled a group of animal antics armed with questions and looking for answers from keeper ruth who would like to go first
isabella do they have a partner
for life no they're quite sociable but they live in family groups
they don't mate for life who else
why are they black and white because of camouflage
on the grass they stick out like a sore thumb but up in the trees their black and white bold patterns break up the silhouette of the lemurs which is what predators would be looking for
are they dangerous no they're not dangerous really
lemurs are quite docile as a species but i imagine they could give you a nasty bite if they wanted to
is there a dominant female or male in the group
in lemur society the females are dominant due to them being bigger and stronger and more aggressive than the males
who is the dominant one here grunge is our dominant female not a very nice name for a lady
that might be her behind you
do you think she is keeping an eye on us cos she is the dominant one
yes she could be
charlotte why don't you ask one
do they built nests they do the females will gather
nest materials such as twigs and leaves and use that for bedding in the wild their nest would generally be a hollow tree but in captivity we recreate this using wooden nest boxes where the females go off and forage for food and leave the young in their nests as the young get braver they'll gradually venture out of their nest box
ruth thank you very much some brilliant answers to our questions gang have you learned a lot about black and white lemurs
yes we'll be back next time with some more ask the keeper the keepers here are always trying to make life more interesting for the animals now i am back with keeper chris hales who's trying to turn tiger meal times into a challenge early on you mentioned that you think ingrid will get the food first
definitely i am going to have to go with tug then
cos i feel a bit sorry for him you're gonna let the big cats out and and we're going to see how they do brilliant i'll leave you to do that bit though
come on guys tug ingrid come on
here they come
come on you are you ready are you ready
make it fair ingrid is straight out not a problem off she is going chris do oh look at tug i'm impressed let's see that again he has just crawled up to that they have to jump down don't they
they do there is different ways that they can get down because tigers aren't natural climbers it is very difficult for them to come back down they are not used to being up at a height
it looks so wrong to see a tiger up a tree is she stuck that is awesome she's just trying to get the food down
she will probably start eating it
is that something they would normally do not at all
normally she will run straight up the tree grab it jump down but we obviously put it up there too well and she is having a little bit of a problem
here she goes
she jumped off occasionally we put the food up higher and that is more difficult for them to get down they don't want to jump off from that kind of height it is hard for them to come down cos their claws are hooking downwards like this and so in order for them to get down they have to lift their foot off or retract their claws they don't want to do that cos they are going to fall they are very clumsy when it comes to climbing back down again
what else would they use their claws for
they are actually their most important tool that they own they use them for getting hold of their prey and they can cling on cos they are razor sharp their claws can get to two or three inches long and they have these trees in here that they will go up to scratch their claws on to make them sharp
so this enrichment test is good as well to keep their claws sharp yes brilliant they look very happy they have got their meat and i am really happy to have got there first thanks very much
early in the show you saw me and stuart collecting this delightful bucket of poo from the tapier enclosure now we are inside one of the black rhino enclosures and we are about to begin our enrichment test the idea is to see how these rhinos will react to another animals' droppings in the territory
first we have got to get rid of all this poo that is there let's get digging
they have got three black rhino in this area
three black rhino in the collection here
will we just let them all out
no what we will do is let one out because we need to be able to gauge what their reaction is going to be black rhinos are solitary in the wild they are highly aggressive animals because of that they have a really acute sense of smell and hearing but very poor eyesight their sense of smell and that hearing actually helps them survive out in the wild if we let all three through and this tapier poo has a negative type reaction that produces aggression we have three rhinos in one place at one time one at a time is a good idea
no worries great stuff i will see you back in a bit
the smells good here she comes fingers crossed for a good reaction hey she just came straight over
she is definitely possibly interested in what is going on here
who have we got here this is mafenge
she is one of our female rhinos if anything she is probably the most reactive she is quite a bolshie character she will take a lot of interest in what is going on here
she's having a good sniff yes snorting a little bit there is that just scenting or is this some sort of reaction do you think
she's just generally taking her time it is a completely foreign smell to her and she is taking her time being patient and she is really assessing what is going on
she has just turned around and trod right in the poo do you think she has done that on purpose could possibly be
she looks as if she wants to actually lay her marker down as we were talking she is going to do a poo right on top of it
you can smell that is quite tough that is gross let's see it again
she is doing everything that i thought she might do that smell is now going to be released across the area in the wild their sense of smell is that acute that any rhinos within her territory will be able to smell that right now and will want to come and investigate it
it is amazing to see her behaving this way do you think it has been a success
yes it has been a great success she has done something to stimulate her natural behaviour maybe we can try a few more different smells maybe something from her own continent like the african elephants or even a predator smell we will have to see how it goes
will you let us know i would love to see her again for now shall we move off it is a little bit wiffy round here
now continuing with the poo theme theme we have asked the keepers who they think is the smelliest animal in the park
definitely louis the giant anteater
the smelliest animal has to be the monkeys
probably the gorilla because he has lots of smelly poos sometimes
speak for yourself love
it would have to be the gorillas the reason for that is every time i seem to be clearing out i get lots of poo on the end of my boots
ocelots ocelots i would say the ocelot
the smelliest animal has to be the ocelot male in particular when they urinate on metal it actually liquidates it
the elephants the elephants the elephants smelliest animal in the park has got to be the rhinos they poo a lot and in the summer it really makes it smell
i think the smelliest animal in the park is the tapiers are you sure
the smelliest animal i say is the javan langurs cos they burp a lot
the langurs when they burp in your face
the smelliest animal i would say would have to be an ocelot
the ocelots apart from myself i'd have to say the ocelots
the ocelot shed's pretty much a bog of eternal stench if you put your hand in any of their mess you won't get it off in about twenty washes
so the clear winner with the most smelly votes is the ocelot it's dinner time here for the twelve elephants so we've come down to give liz morris and her team a helping hand
all right liz it's a noisy job as you can here but we need this dumper truck to shift this amount of food how long will this last them through the night
this is their last feed of the day whereas we do like to feed them three times a day so they're feeding all the time like in the wild
is this the same food you would feed them at every meal
no they get fruit and veg in the morning then hay now and maybe some treats throughout the day
it is hard work this isn't it i'll just throw this in
there is always certain elephants that will feed first there is a hierarchy within the elephants obviously you get the boss the matriarch which is massa who got her food first over there she gets the food first and then you go down the hierarchy
what about the little calves when will they get to eat
they basically eat with them mum so whenever mum needs they eat
i'll chuck this one here as you can see we have our work cut out for us we'll finish up this job it's the end of the show check out what's coming up on the next roar
i'll get the next batch
a wild dog puppy is dangerously ill will a killer bug spread to the entire pack
we find out how you measure a giraffe
and the elephants can't go out to lunch cos they've locked themselves in a paddock
thank you very much indeed lovely hello everyone and welcome to ready steady cook fabulous food coming your way against the clock with ingredients the chefs have never seen before let's find out more as we welcome them and our special guests first up in the green kitchen with leslie waters please welcome the fabulous pop singer and garden designer it's kim wilde and in the red kitchen with chef alex mackay we've got another fantastic gardener ladies and gentlemen he's also a bit of a mean presenter the girls love him yes it's diarmuid gavin great to see you are you well
oh really well yes fantastic good to see you
i just can't believe that one minute you're on stage doing this then you've got your hands in the garden getting nice and dirty and stuff are you quite expressive in the kitchen too
i love being in the kitchen i don't get there enough because my husband is a very good chef but i do enjoy it i enjoy cooking for the children quite plain simple food but good nutritious stuff and i enjoy using vegetables that we grow in the garden so i enjoy that too
any of that in there go on let's have a look let's have a look
there's nothing from my garden but i have grown kale which is some curly kale there and there's some miniature carrots which are a very good idea for growing with children go on give it a bit of a shake we like a little bit of a shake puy lentils because i love lentils i love these these are already cooked which is great lamb i'm not a big meat eater but if i do eat it i love to eat lamb and this is organic meat which i think is a good choice and then some goats' cheese
proper butter oh is it cheese
a little bit over so that's a good old bistro bag there lovely what about our chef leslie what does she think of it beautiful bag
i think with the lamb i'd love to do some sort of spicy koftas and then do some really lovely lentils to go with that the goats' cheese we ought to do a goats' cheese tart and we can do quite an unusual lentil dressing with lots of herbs and balsamic drizzle that over the top and the rest we'll make up as we go along these we're not going to do very much to they're so beautiful keep it simple
i think you do i know i do don't tell anybody though ladies and gentlemen leslie and kim
how you doing my man very good good to see you alex are you all right
very good good are you a bit of a scrubber
do you get in the kitchen and do the old cleaning up of carrots
i can't make toast you're joking i'm pathetic no i visit the kitchen to eat but i never prepare any food why's that
i thought you know that's going to change today you see did you see the finger come out there
i'm scared no it's funny because when i left school many years ago i started working in a restaurant and my ambition was either to be a chef or a gardener and after about two or three months i decided to go into the gardening oh go on get that bag out mate
you wanted to be a chef it's quite interesting that isn't it
he only gave it about two months though he recovered
i loved every moment of it but gardening was the thing that drew me
are you sure you're irish and not italian well there's the irish
good old tazza tell us what you've brought along there
so parma ham chicken of course spuds mozzarella cheese and olives some of my favourite things to eat it is quite mediterranean
this couldn't be a better bag you're missing a bit of sunshine thought we'd get it on the plate
it's very good how much was all of this then diarmuid seven point four two very good
it's exactly the sort of food i like i spent a lot of time in the south of france so it's my kind of stuff i'll do a tart but not with a pastry base with a potato base in a salute to your irishness with courgettes and tomatoes on top and i'll just dice some mozzarella and put that over and then i'm going to do a herb and olive stuffed chicken breast wrapped in the parma ham and a few other things that you'll make up as you go along your wife won't recognise you when you get home wonderfully creative in the garden
equally creative in the kitchen at the end of this ladies and gentlemen alex and diarmuid o. k. ladies and gentlemen you know what happens now we give our chefs twenty minutes to come up with those wonderful recipes will they achieve it we're about to find out when i say ready steady cook alrighty get that apron on kim nice chopping board up there for you les what's happening i just want to get this pastry on
actually kim what i want you to do is wash me a few bits of the kale i want you to open these up give them a wash and just lightly trim them off for me
do you grow your own vegetables then kim
yeah all sorts of salad leaves things like mitsuna and mustard greens and all kinds of lovely things like that in pots as well you can grow them in pots right outside the kitchen
and how do the children react are they quite good do you like to get out there and help mum do all this
yes but i was talking to kim earlier and saying i'm so rubbish in the garden i really want to be able to grow vegetables and stuff a good friend of mine helps us but i am rubbish whereas my sister jaq she's got real green fingers she really has
but you can develop that as kim was saying
you just have to have a go don't be scared to muck up yes exactly
don't worry i do otherwise you wouldn't do anything in life if it doesn't grow just try again
how do you want those trimmed down les are you happy
quite a bit of flour in there bit of butter
butter yeah and i'm just going to do a quick bit of this is the dull bit actually pastry made in the food processor nothing wrong with that what i will say is that if you've got a pulse button good idea to use it when you add the wet ingredients because if you just let it go round and round it goes very tough so we've got about eight ounces of flour four ounces of butter and i'm just going to add a couple of egg yolks to that
that's a good little tip that leslie's just given you so many of us put on the old food processor it goes like that you're thinking it gets into a ball and you end up with tough tough pastry but you know that little pulse button comes in very handy
and obviously with pastry the less water you put in and the less you work it the better it's going to be so pulse
i've got a really good tip to start you off if you're using parma ham like this that's been sliced put it in the fridge and use it straight out of the fridge because this should be really easy to wrap up as soon as it warms up it just goes crazy doesn't it
it sticks to this it's like glue yeah carry on chef
while you're here you could help me with it couldn't you mate
i could do a bit of a peel back another thing that i would suggest with this
if you're cooking at home is to use streaky bacon instead of parma ham
or a bit of pancetta or something like that chef
well pancetta is basically streaky bacon i know yes just some smoked streaky bacon you get good streaky bacon in the north of england do they good bacon in ireland
very very good yes they do good bacon in ireland too by the best authority
someone who never cooks and doesn't even grow his own veg
i know but he loves to eat i'm sure
i do do you eat a lot of traditional irish food diarmuid this would be typical of the food i'd eat being irish i do love the potato that's the staple but i'm doing something new with a potato that i've never done before you're teaching him some skills
shall i just give you a great tip about these potato rostis yeah he's doing the base for the potato rosti when you're doing that at home don't parcook the potatoes at all grate them put them in a tea towel and squeeze them out get all that liquid coming out that way you don't have to cook them the whole way in the pan half in the pan the rest in the oven
i can't think of any reason why you wouldn't because the thing is if you don't shake out that excess ainsley it's going to stick to the pan could you be so kind as to do me a bowlful of basil picked basil
lovely he's keeping you busy there did you want that chopped up chef no just pick the basil
i was just going to say to diarmuid in this field you have to cook while you talk you have to multitask your wife will be very impressed when you get home
tear that up do you often tear it or do you like to shred it
i shred it no no just take the leaves off whole please there's ainsley interfering again
shh don't tell anyone this is exciting very exciting in this pan here
so i've done one half of the potatoes i've then put the cheese on top a bit of parma ham then i'll put the second half of the potatoes on top so you've got this beautiful crisp potato cake and inside you've got the melting cheese
any other types of cheese you could use
this is mozzarella you could use goats' cheese cheddar cheese is fantastic or if you like stinky melty camembert and brie and things that's pretty good too
ooh any of those cheeses all right then lovely that's all going in the oven and what about the courgette chef
the courgette is going to feature on top of the tart so i need to get my little rear into gear now and make some pastry so i'm going to make pastry in the food processor wow with some of that basil that's been we've got about ten minutes this is very exciting
we're just going to put together the koftas really quickly have you got an egg there darling yes and we've got some garlic and some spices let's have one of those eggs darling that is absolutely fantastic any chickens at home then kim
no not yet i go away too much and you need to be around to look after chickens i'd love to though
so you're still touring are you
i do lots of travelling lots of live gigs in europe germany i do a few here as well i've got one here in july at some point but yeah i love singing live i'm still singing the old songs often with all the other eighties artists like heaven seventeen and spandau ballet
and you all probably talk about kids don't you we do and we laugh at each other a little bit
but we have a great time we still love performing
it's not all just singing though you're also doing something at the chelsea flower show with diarmuid over there yes what are you guys actually doing
well you know he's got an incredible design it's so beautiful and i just volunteered to help so i'm picking over plants and taking any of the dead and nasty bits and just trying to get a gold medal for diarmuid that's what we want is a gold really ah
any chance of you winning this gold then
i don't think so i don't think we'll come up to kim's standards
he said that he's never sung before but you guys sung together has he got a decent voice
he's got a lovely voice that's an exaggeration he's just got a lovely way about him hasn't he he just dives in doing things that he hasn't done before and he gives it his heart and soul he's a man of passion i'm a big fan this was a christmas number was it it was a christmas carol thing yeah absolutely i had to apologise to him at one point because i was teasing him and then i saw he was getting a hurt look on his face aaaw i had to apologise to him and i felt terrible
we're going to get those into the oven beautiful
can i do anything useful
just dance with you rock with you what's just come out of there les
very nice looks really nice
i've done a flat tart i'm doing this with goats' cheese if you don't like goats' cheese you could put cheddar on the top or some brie or some camembert i need to get that into the oven now so that can really start to cook she cooks with such style and easiness
that's what it's all about i love simple food that's easy to throw together
nothing that requires a little bowl of that and a little bowl
do you do a lot of fresh food i just throw stuff in salt and pepper garlic
maybe a few fresh herbs which you can grow so easily sure
it's fantastic what you've done there
it's something very simple i mean look at that carrots and orange juice fantastic kim put the whole orange in aah and you roast them off so everything goes in so the oven gets full use
so what about the rest of the family kim they're equally talented in the singing and the gardening department are they
well my little brother who's taller than you he's a landscape gardener now so i've been helping him do some projects good looking boy isn't he he's a very handsome yeah a good looking boy he is he's gorgeous and in fact he's due his baby any day now as well his second baby
congratulations lovely i have been helping him do some projects really good fun
am i being completely useless you're not i tell you what
if you get that yoghurt out of the fridge for me i've got that fantastic if you could crush some garlic for me add it to the yoghurt with some chopped mint where's the garlic crusher i've got the garlic crusher your sister what's she up to
well my sister roxanne she's just gone on tour with
give it a little bang there you go love ah fantastic
she's just gone on tour as a backing vocals for kylie minogue
ooh which is great because she loves kylie is she enjoying it
she's having a ball and she's getting married next year so i'm very excited for roxanne there's lots of stuff going on in our family your family all live quite close to you don't they they do give it a squeeze
that's it in there you just wanted to see me do that didn't you i just wanted to see you squeeze it oh gimme gimme
this is very hot everything's happening i'll move you all the way around the stove here potato rosti so here grated potato squeeze that lovely and dry put it in half put the mozzarella cheese on the inside other half on top i've fried that so it's beautiful golden brown crisp on the outside and melting within tons of butter this chicken is now cooked tons of butter
you add the butter afterwards knobs of butter around the outside that important because it caramelises
in a different way with oil so if you put it in at the beginning it will burn
diarmuid i'm talking
diarmuid just pour it over his head don't worry
you're chatting to your mates and the gardener interrupts what's he like here i've got the pastry made with olive oil instead of butter i've started it in a pan
that takes four and a half minutes these chefs they time everything to perfection don't they hey over here ainsley now this is very exciting this is something not a lot of people do and i love it i'm going to make a raw courgette salad now you think about cucumbers in a salad things like that but not courgettes courgettes make a lovely salad dressed with some extra virgin olive oil herbs and a touch of lemon and now go and see what he's up to over there
that's lovely look at that that crispness on that parma ham i know the chef said use a bit of the old pancetta or streaky bacon but that does look lovely it's that intense colour you get
do you know it'd say the same thing about you
anything creative i mean just look at that potato the way it was produced look at the chicken wrapped in the ham lovely
you're producing a new programme with your daughter am i right you meeting zara philips and princess anne that was a load of pony kids in dublin
a bit more dice a little bit more that's lovely thank you that's perfect
tell us a about that diarmuid well we were working with five kids from some of
the rougher housing estates round dublin who love working with horses to train them to become showjumpers so zara philips helped me out and invited me to her mum's estate where i saw her taking part in three day eventing very particular on food these kids oh really yeah zara had laid out the most extraordinary spread the best of organic food and they walked in and they just said chips and coleslaw was the only thing they wanted wouldn't eat anything they looked at the food and said that's disgusting but they were great
what about your gardening series for the beeb
we're doing the gardening series in arden now called i want a garden i do the designs and it's up to the clients to build the gardens so they do the designs with you and really get involved
instead of coming home and being surprised they give me a brief
like one couple recently gave me a brief they wanted undulations lord of the rings mounds and humps so we got jerry hall to do a modelling session for us and we built her one hundred fifty foot long twenty five foot high in the middle of a garden in ireland
we can't wait to see that that's brilliant brilliant fun fantastic looking forward to it do you enjoy the idea of being a celebrity gardener
i love the opportunity of getting to do stuff that people know who you are are and give you challenges
dermot mate if you put some of that chervil around the outside of this plate
could you wipe the plates for me i've just made a bit of a mess
twenty seconds audience get ready to help me count down let's just pour some nuts
ten nine eight seven six five four three two one
it's quite pink with a really sort of nice salt and pepper crust and then we've cooked it in those creamy lentils and the lentils what do you think of that the lentils with turmeric and cumin white wine and the puy lentils which were already cooked but they kind of went in
really lovely quite spicy tasting nice and crunchy on the top and lovely and rare i love meat nice and rare like that gorgeous
this is lovely the contrast between these spicy meat koftas and this is it greek yoghurt you made that
greek yoghurt and mint garlic is it and mint mint's a great thing to put in it
pick up your carrot with your fingers these are so simple
butter a bit of olive oil toss them in that roast them in the oven with some orange so simple children would just love those yes it's a marriage made in heaven orange carrots oranges
great taste sensation that is lovely very simple
and then finally we've got the tart here and this is with the goats' cheese and what we did was we just made some pastry very very quickly onions and kale on the bottom you'll like the egg go for that then just baked it in the oven so the kale and the onions softened and then we made a dressing using the puy lentils with the balsamic and olive oil and as the tart comes out it just goes over the top
this is great this pastry's really sort of squishy and moreish and then the cheese i love this roasted goats' it was grilled wasn't it yeah and the herbs with it too you can throw herbs on pretty much anything
cor listen to you two you could be here all day ladies and gentlemen let's hear it for kim and leslie oh dear you're about to get into food mode too diarmuid get stuck into it anything you want
look at the colour of it first lovely where should he start there's a perfect place to start i'm going to start with that potato because it looks so inviting there
i love the idea that you stuffed it with the mozzarella and everything talk to us about that it's a potato rosti which is like a potato cake
but i've stuffed it with the parma ham and the mozzarella and then i put the raw courgette and tomato salad round the outside
sorry diarmuid's tasting the chicken that's got olives inside and parma ham round the outside i didn't season the chicken because there's enough salt and then i made quite a lot of tomato coulis to contrast that salt again so it looks so fresh
those colours again so vibrant exactly they really do stick out
very light really light not a heavy meal at all and i'm not a great meat eater but chicken done like that is gorgeous lovely that really works for you
and finally that lovely home made tart
what's special about this is the pastry so the pastry's made with olive oil instead of butter that gives you a crumbly texture and then it's topped with the tomatoes and the courgettes grilled quickly so it's somewhere between raw and cooked if you like and then the parsley puree round the outside
yes all these dishes here both leslie and alex's dishes it's sunshine food i'm sure makes you want to dive in gentlemen thank you very much indeed alex and diarmuid well ladies and gentlemen once again i think it's going to be a bit of a tough call but it's down to our studio audience what will they decide on will it be kim and leslie in the green kitchen or diarmuid and alex in the red the choice is yours guys please pick up your keypads because now i'd like you all to vote let's see where you go with this and the lights are already flashing a few have made up your mind others are thinking i'm not sure am i in the mood for that lamb well the boards are now filled who has won today by one it's a red kitchen win how close was that very close indeed there's your ready steady cook winner's plate
thank you we'd love to make a donation towards your favourite charity which is the niall mellon township trust which builds houses in south africa
great thank you very much indeed fantastic and what about you one one i can't believe it one eh les but when you're touring all over the world and you'd like to reflect back on the day you spent here you can whip out your ready steady cook mug yeah thank you so much great to have you here
that was such a great experience fabulous food
you were brilliant we should open a restaurant together i'd love that
hello how are you doing there how did this idea come about we wanted to include more people from the department in our social events so we needed events that weren't based around curries and drinking
oh really that's what university's all about innit let's be honest so what do you guys actually make do you get together and include the egg and put the flour in got to do the whole lot
personally i expect lots of fruit based cakes so banana loafs apple cakes and so on
i've also heard that there's a bit of opera involved in this too is there
each year for our christmas party we have a musical variety show one of our very talented members wrote us a little operato about cake and the passion and the love that cake can inspire in us
we do but i don't you don't you don't sing oh no
give us your bag then will you come over later and have a try love to fantastic thank you gentlemen it's quite nice that you keep these type of traditions alive thank you very much luke from birmingham university
is there cake in it well i kind of
where's the cake we've got a bit of pigeon breast there it looks like streaky bacon your favourite
i like streaky bacon butter beans a bottle of cider tomatoes and where's the cake
i tell you what since they're cakes we can try making a sort of bean and tomato cake whizzing up some of the beans in a pan then we could do a clafouti or a fritata with the tomatoes again that's a type of cake and some eggs and then maybe a warm salad of herbs bacon and pigeon
and your ten minute cooking time les starts now
all right so i'm just going to get this butter bean pate going which i absolutely
do you often make that at home i do i use any of those tinned beans they're so convenient
it makes a better style hummus it is smoother with butter beans
than the actual chick pea yeah than the actual chick pea
i'm a chick pea kind of a guy no i'm a butter bean bird
a butter bean bird that sounds something
and you're a borlotti bean queen you could call me a borlotti queen if you want all right
and what we'll also of course it does help if i put them in the fridge that's my pan
i've put a bit of oil in there for you thank you no problem chef
i'll put a little bit of basil in but if you want to go with basil that's fine no thyme is probably better i love thyme actually
we want these nice and rare lovely i've got some toasted sesame seeds here guys
sesame seeds are so lovely and oily you don't need to put anything in the pan they kind of do themselves
what can i do now leslie
i was going to do citrus too a touch of cheese to go into your salad
actually oh thank you there we are alex can you pass us a zester please that'd be great
that's it you can read my mind give him a round of applause sorry darling i'm going to put i'm going to put some lime zest in the butter beans to cut it
ooh that sounds nice you know because they're quite rich
how's that bacon doing ainsley lovely does that need a toss
i don't mind giving that a toss shall i sort the breasts out there
i need a slightly lower temperature for those all right
how long would you think pigeon breast do you cook it like chicken you can actually serve it pink
no you would actually want it rare rare because there's no fat it dries out really quick
there you go exactly as she says it dries out quickly lovely it's not poultry it's game lovely and i've got the fondue leslie talked about a fondue guys and what we've got in here is the cider that's reducing down we've put the cheese in there in an ideal world you'd like to reduce that down we'll probably have to thicken it with cornflower at the end there but we'll see how that goes we also have a quickie question from one of our audience members today it comes from excuse me rosemary langley so let's find out exactly what rosemary would like to ask our chefs listen up guys
yes when making onion rings should you soak them in milk first
it is a lot of people soak them in milk first because it takes away the harshness of the onion and it just helps to sort of soften them up a little bit i think it's a good idea i've done them not soaked and soaked and i think they're always better soaked
what i like to do is use red onions cut them quite thickly and instead of soaking them sprinkle them with salt and sugar leave them for fifteen minutes and that makes the flavour much more gentle
shall i sort out the cornflour you certainly can and then we can start to serve stuff up
the bacon needs to be a bit more crispy come on bacon crisp up crisp up there we are
i'm behind you ainsley
i'm just trying to get this glass out the way did the earth move for you you've got to these out the pan otherwise
i have herb salad have you got a bit of herb salad yep here you go fantastic
lovely this is your fondue is there would you like any additional herbs in there les because
one and a half minutes to go you said you wanted the balsamic yes just a little bit of balsamic
hang on a second what would you like me to do with the bacon chop that bacon quickly ains and put it through the salad
balsamic in there in there please some oil drain that
do they go there yes absolutely have you got the croutes there they are
fifteen seconds audience help me count down here we go
ten nine eight seven six five four three two one
stop cooking well done and luke come and join us how are you doing there my man very well were you impressed overall with what the chefs did for you today
very impressed yeah and i think the audience ladies and gentlemen
a little round of applause if you were impressed with the cakes they liked the cakes here you are mate get stuck in pick up a bit of toast and just dip it in there he's gone straight for the duck about to try the old pigeon very nice indeed and how did we do that again chef briefly
stuffed it with orange zest and rosemary wrapped in bacon pan fried in an orange and tomato sauce
took the words straight out of my mouth trev
only here because brother abel picked up that hamstring injury
not so abel after all eh trev ha ha
and who could have seen this coming
you would have seen this tree and anyway we should be sweating about that science project we haven't done
but he's the top player in the world and he's coming here and i can't get near him how bad is that
why say it then dork as one of grange hill's best known ex pupils
good you'll do well to remember his stance on education he's gone on record saying his experience here turned him from a life of crime he's a perfect and popular role model and can help put this c. l. c. on the map so this is a very important day for all of us here and who better to play our genial hosts other than our head boy and girl patrick and tanya now over to you patrick
don't trust most of them as far as i can throw them
gone are the days when straitjackets were an option
keep a close eye please mrs. rawlinson
that's telling you
you'll smirk on the other side of your face when you taste it
why i've read dwayne's book
well my mum has and it's full of macrobiotic gunge she tried making me some once i gave it to the dog and he puked up all over the carpet and i've seen him eat shoes
don't know what a footballer's doing with a cookbook anyway
it's got nothing to do with football he's just a brand these days well i've never heard of him
you're kidding me he's a top celeb rach
we only watch rugby in our house and anything to do with horses
what gets me is why we all have to jump around like idiots just cos he's coming er you did volunteer only to get out of classes
i saw him on that celebrity crossover
he had all this seaweed stuff
he's so loaded could be a new angle for us space andrea space
how many times forget him i've just had a well brill idea we're late with that science homework right and that mrs. rawlinson a right nark when you don't do stuff so i think we should blow her away with the sheer genius of our homework
genius cool what genius
i'm hatching that bit come on
it says my school days were well blissed out
get a grip brain it never says that what a suck he's so up himself
and what's he doing coming here telling us what to do
and what to eat
why's he writing another book about himself he's done nothing it's not as if he's playing for our team any more
er he never did play for my team only cos he knocked you lot back
who does he play for then
he's off to somewhere hot and foreign lanzarote
spain he's off to spain
there was a right kick off about that demo at the ground
but i thought you didn't like him
now we don't that was then
i reckon we knock him down a peg or two uh oh another demo
i don't think that's such a good idea you don't
right we're deffo doing it then count me out whatever we'll get over it too right er who said you were in
you couldn't hack a demo on your own anyway can can't
for a proper demo we need a lot of people
could this have anything to do with jealousy come on rach
might've known you'd bottle it
i read about this kid right got some eggs from the supermarket and hatched them in school
so this your genius plan chickens in the class
boring if i was going to do that we wouldn't be going to where we're going where geek central what it's the only place we're gonna find gyngell
what exactly is this demo about then
us we're getting exploited too right so he needs telling
we won't be eating his slop
show him we mean business how signs big banners
chuck a few eggs and that'll work
course it will so we're clear then we are it'll all end in tears
so this is geek central the library where else
gyngell's not happy unless he's surrounded by books shush now we need to approach him from the front gets spooked easy gyngell gyngell mate it's me laxo
argh argh
whoa gyngell you nearly gave me a thrombie
who's there put your specs on ah laxo
we need a favour can't too busy what you doing hidden text here somewhere just have to look we need some eggs off your dad
as in fertilised or as in with bacon
no not to eat this anything to do with your science project
you haven't done it have you cos i'm doing chickens
no no not chickens i can tell the difference you know it's in here
your dad's got a pet shop you're the best we know not just any old eggs gyngell without you we're sunk we promise no chickens
males have it tough they get fatter we eat them girls lay eggs easy life
amazing gyngell there's the feather method
males have bigger pinfeathers or the vent method that way you get to squeeze the poo out urgh what by hand i'm working on the invention of a machine
it's just asking for bother
oh here comes captain challenged
says here he's got a rotten temper as well
yeah wrote it himself
i would never have thought that would you andrea the temper i mean
are there any pictures a few oh that's his fiancee mercedes
looks like someone's poked a stick through a wet paper bag
maybe she should try the clothes on instead where's that bit about the temper
he won't like the demo whose theirs
oh i dunno if he likes a bit of a ruck i didn't say that are we keeping you i dunno are you
no right then
follow me you geeks doing the interview for the er website yeah ha ha not anymore you're not blab and you're dead
relax once she sees these exotic little beauties it'll be science heaven here we come
how come you get to meet the car
you get to chuck the eggs
nothing to do with the telly people being here then
as if anyway this bit was my idea
i might have known wherever there's a johnson what do you think they're doing seems demonstration runs in both families
i'll kill them no time patrick
you meet the car outside the gates and bring them in round the back i'll inform mr. mcdonnell make haste make haste we'll deal with this lot later
how do you switch it on andrea do i have to do everything
here this must be it right you do the camera i'll do the questions alls we have to do is make sure he loses his temper catch it on camera and sell it to the papers easy peasy
chloe you always say that
andrea this'll be different he's a footballer so he's thick he's a celebrity so he's full of himself he's any easy target and we've got the bunch of half wits doing most of the work for us with their stupid demo he's bound to lose it some time so alls we've got to do is make sure we're there when he does all right so let's make movies

hello welcome to your monday's news round the computer game that tells you you are overweight when you are not what's that all about plus a sneaky peak at the new indiana jones film hi there first they're meant to be loads of fun but it seems one of your favourite games is making some of you upset we are talking about wii fit it's been telling some kids they're fat when they're not what's going on laura's been finding out wii fit is the latest computer craze you lot love it and already of shops have sold out of it if you have never used it before wii fit is supposed to help you get well fit by doing lots of exercises using this board before you start you step on to it you tell the machine how tall you are and how old you are it works out how much you weigh it tells you if you are overweight underweight or just right so you can help track your fitness levels the problem is because you lot grow at different rates the readings are sometimes a bit weird that's what happened to eleven year old tabea a normal size for her age and never worried about her weight until wii fit told her she was overweight
i put my height in and it calculated my weight it said i was everywoet and overweight and i was sad girls of my age shouldn't know we are overweight and all that some girls could go on silly diets
tabea now realises she is not overweight and doesn't need to diet some people are concerned this could have a bad effect on other kids
home running around in the rubble it could be dangerous especially for the children who lost their families i called on all the students to come so we could keep an eye on them more importantly we cannot let students miss too many
classes this school fewer than ninety have
returned to class
this isn't going to be easy
not as easy as it used to be

but add to that the stress of taking on a self sufficient country lifestyle at the same time ambitious or crazy the streets of nottingham are never empty with more and more people flocking to the area for its growing business opportunities and international transport links but on top of that it's the place for retail therapy nearly six hundred thousand shoppers hit the streets every week not surprisingly retailers are queuing up for a piece of the action six hundred companies are currently looking for premises here with nearly one million people living in and around the city the centre is a flurry of people traffic and trams property is affordable here prices being twenty per cent lower than the national average but for mark and vanessa smithson the birth of their first child has meant a change of priorities their move to the country is as much about living a greener lifestyle as living in a greener setting
i'd like to think that we're really green but all we have chance to do is recycle as much as we can and use energy efficient light bulbs when we move to the country i'd like us to to generate our own energy maybe using solar or wind and then we'd like to grow our own vegetables so really we need a lot more space outside than we've actually got now
the advantage of their garden is it backs on to the local park handy for the family dog willow and for baby drew but a city park isn't the countryside haven vanessa wants to bring up her family in
i do enjoy living around here with the playgroups for drew and swimming but it's not the countryside for us we feel that we need a safer environment for her for when she grows up at the end of the day this isn't the countryside what we're after
the property benefits from a through lounge dining room which is light and spacious and leads to decking in the rear garden
the back garden is a good size with decked and lawn areas then it's back in to the narrow galley style kitchen back through the hall is the staircase up to the first floor at the back of the house there's a family bathroom right next to the master bedroom
it's a generously proportioned master bedroom with pleasant views over the park to the rear a great aspect to wake up to
it's on for one hundred seventy nine thousand nine hundred fifty

we'd like to move in between newark and lincoln not too far from work and not too far from the parents
mark i know you've got this eco friendly dream so tell me what ideally you'd like to find in a house
solar panels or maybe a wind turbine
i think the chances of me finding four properties that have got that kind of equipment are quite remote so would you be up for putting it in yourselves
as long as there's space to be able to put the things in then that would be perfect
right let's think about the house itself vanessa give me your essentials list
i'd love to have a separate dining room and i'd like to have a downstairs toilet
and how many bedrooms we'd like four possibly five and what about outside space what would be a minimum size of garden
currently our garden is about ten metres by twenty so ideally we'd like it to be twice as long and twice as wide
any other essentials
yes we'd like to have a study downstairs that would be ideal
what about bonuses things you would like on your wish list
i'd love to have a utility room just to put all the washing machine and dryer out the way
i'd like a basement so that maybe you could store wine or go back to making our own wine cos we used to do it
you're going to be busy folk when you move to the country the sheep and the chickens and the wine making i have to say you've got quite a long list of things but i think i've got an idea now of what i'm looking for you've got a really good budget because lincolnshire prices are still very reasonable so you two just need to stay logged on now i'll send you back pictures of the houses i'm finding and hopefully i'll turn up the perfect eco friendly dream country house for you
great fantastic
that's nice
that's a nice garden
that's the cellar it looks a very good size it is with great headroom for a cellar
a cellar fantastic stick your wine pool table
wow look at the ceiling amazing so what's the age of the house
goodness me so it really is proper period property
very yeah and this is amazing
it looks like it was originally an inglenook fireplace was it
that's right it was an inglenook fireplace right
one thing i'm noticing instantly is there's no furniture here have you moved out already
yeah i moved out in november
so what did you use this room for
this was the dining room looks quite big for a dining room actually that should be good yeah
then through to the conservatory when was that put on we put that on five years ago so which way are we facing south facing so if it's a nice sunny evening that's a really good place to sit yeah it was lovely
just what we want a south facing garden sunshine sit and have your breakfast excellent
children's music room really looks lovely and light cos you've got windows on both sides
it'd be excellent for a study cos you wouldn't be out the way then would you
i might have to learn to play the piano though
right so back across the main hallway there's some serious hunks of wood in this property aren't there
there are that's amazing
that's a much more impressive size for a lounge
and mark and vanessa actually have two pretty chunky sofas which i guess you could fit here and here and then you've got patio doors out to the garden that's right yes
not sure about the chandelier
i'm not sure about the fireplace but we could change it it's not a problem
my goodness it goes on and on this property doesn't it we're to the back of the house now what have we got here that's the downstairs cloakroom gosh very funky did you do that
yeah we did
looks big for a downstairs cloakroom
and what's through that door there abi that's the utility and through there the back garden brilliant
that's a bit of a tiny back garden isn't it i like the fact that it's walled in you could let drew out and she wouldn't escape on to the road
nice modern kitchen nice modern kitchen
it's got a table and a chair just what we wanted for drew
i'm coming out of the front of the house to the side in front of the conservatory we've got the garage but the main body of the garden is here to the front of the property big lawned area i reckon there's plenty of space here to get a sizeable vegetable patch so long as the neighbours don't mind because we are overlooked at the back by a property there and by the rest of the house here which is attached
slightly overlooked cos our garden's not overlooked at all is it
no it's not attached house bit maybe that's concerning me at the moment
this property feels like it has a real warren of rooms downstairs and so it is upstairs first of all we've got this separate wing here which turns out to be largely devoted to bathroom space this is the family bathroom
that is a massive bathroom wow i'm not sure about having carpet on your bathroom floor tend to get wet
back round the corridor from the bathroom through this archway leads into where the bedrooms are situated there are four in total they're in a row along this corridor here so bedroom number one is at the far end of the house it's a really good size it's got fairly low ceilings got some interesting features we've got this beam which i guess is an original which sort of disappears off into these more recently fitted wardrobes
not sure about that building your wardrobes around a beam
it's very interesting it's very interesting
so back down the corridor this is bedroom two very pink
bit of diy for you there honey ssh
all the bedrooms are on the same side of the house so they've all got south facing windows so lots of light and up the stairs here to the master bedroom nice old door there so this is a really good sized room i have to say it's got so many fitted cupboards and vanity units that it's quite hard to work out where you'd put the bed but i guess it's going to have to be here cos this is the only wall space that's left
i don't really like those cupboards i'm not sure i like the moulding on them they look a bit er i don't know tacky really
i like the gravel garden nice bay kind of like what we've got now though
yes the house was built in nineteen thirty and started life as the rectory of bracebridge heath
i think that looks like quite a good size for a living room certainly looks like there's plenty of space to fit our sofas in
so we're facing the front here so the rest of the house goes backwards indeed shall we carry on down the hall and have a look yes goodness this really is the house of doors isn't it indeed it is this the study all important room for mark
i thought that was like a dining room but it looks pretty sizeable for a study
good space you've got a desk a piano and sofa and bookshelves which is great i imagine it's fairly quiet is it it is being on the side this is perfect really good so shall we carry on look at what's next aha separate dining room this is another of the things on my list
those three doors mean that makes it quite a big space so you could use it when you'd got people round
you could either shut the doors or leave them open as they've done
have you used this much very much so
it's obviously a very social area and we've tried to make as full use of it as we possibly could
that is a good sized space plenty of space for a good table and then flows through into the kitchen here another great thing is that you've space for a table in your kitchen it's a good family house and a good family kitchen which is great
yeah i'd want to do something with those units and things cos it looks a bit
it's a bit dated isn't it it is a little bit dated
and then flows on through so what's in that section at the back
to the left is our utility room where you've got your washing machine etc
plenty of space for the washer tumbler yep
so out of the back door the first thing you come to is the double garage so already a big bonus another bonus is that rob had this built extra big
so all that hoarding that you like doing you'll be able to fit all those boxes up there yeah thanks
our garden's at the back it is you can go in the garden and escape from the noise whereas that's at the side it's a nice size i don't know if the fumes would affect your vegetables
if you view this house front on from outside it actually looks quite small but inside there's an amazing amount of space cos it all goes back it has still got that lovely nineteen thirties style to it which i rather like there are four bedrooms upstairs this is the first and the smallest at the front
that is a small bedroom that's i would have said that's smaller than our small room
next door is bedroom number two it's a really good sized double we are at the front of the house here but the secondary glazing cuts out some road noise
again looks like there's gonna be kind of a lot of work to do
next door you've got bedroom number three which again is a good sized double i'm amazed by the spaciousness of these bedrooms and now we're going towards the back of the house in the centre of the corridor you've got the family bathroom this is the only bathroom at the moment apart from that little shower room downstairs
i'm not sure that's a full sized bath it looks a small bathroom
so on down the corridor that's the airing cupboard and at the very far end is the loo in here is the master bedroom it's got good big windows so it's nice and light in here and we're on the side of the property it's a really good sized room but it doesn't have that en suite bathroom that vanessa so wants rob tells me that he has considered knocking through this rather jauntily decorated little fitted cupboard on the far side of it is the existing loo so you could with a bit of imagination incorporate an en suite bathroom into the plans
i don't mind getting my hands dirty but to be honest i'd rather spend the time installing the energy efficient stuff
london road is a good sized family home with a garden ripe for all of mark's eco plans but the property would need a bit of updating and the road may put them off still to come on escape to the country mark and vanessa find plenty to agree on when it comes to their plans for interior decor
we'd have to rip it out and start again yeah that's a lot of work to do in here as well
but when it comes to boys and their toys there's no negotiation
big t. v. screen leather sofa fantastic all me games consoles it'll be excellent no no no no no no
eco friendly house
interested in the eco thing but i'm not sure i like the look of the house from the outside
the question is are mark and vanessa really willing to compromise a little on their wish list in order to get their eco house right chris here we are i've been very intrigued on the way over to see what a twenty first century eco home would look like you could expect starship enterprise but it looks like a normal house
yeah it's designed with the mainstream market in mind but it's got all these environmental technologies in built as well i can't wait to these let's get inside
in we come nice wide hallway that's a good start what have we got in here craig
that's the downstairs toilet in there and what's in here just spare storage space in there but you've also got intelligent heating control as well it basically reacts and learns and adapts to the house and changes to the climate as well
it adjusts without you having to re programme it
that's right it just makes it easy for the consumer
so the intelligent thing is you close the door and it gets on with it yes fantastic
sounds like a really good idea just to minimise your costs
it does minimise your energy usage
so let's go through here first this looks like the sitting room is it yeah
that's a nice size that
it is plenty of space to get our sofas in
there's double the level of insulation in the thickness of this wall
that's gonna make it more energy efficient yes
i've got underfloor heating throughout this ground floor and the basement
double insulation means you're already starting to save energy straightaway which is good
it's over four floors i noticed on the details
additional basement as well so that's the basement down there
shall we do that next another door what have we got in here craig
utility room down in there oh brilliant
utility room downstairs would i be up and down stairs carrying your washing
i'd be definitely fit wouldn't i big room through here
it's a huge room this one it's a huge space
obviously it is on the basement level but it has got light from this is rather funky isn't it
this is a light pipe you just get a bit of natural light
mark is after a study so i guess he could use this it's huge isn't it
that would be a massive study i'd have to use it as a library as well i'd be lost in the corner wouldn't i that is big
i can't help but notice this extraordinary thing is it part of the boiler system
no this is actually a vacuum system there's loads of pipes in the house and various points where you just plug in your vacuum hose and hoover away
back up from the basement so on the ground floor again now central hallway so there's the living room this must be the kitchen
that's quite bright
it's nice and big kitchen looks nice and modern
so first things first if i wanted to do a bit of vacuuming where do i plug the hose in
your point's just under here just do it from this one point this one point brilliant
you have to have a long hose then cos that's a big room
so i guess they have still got a separate eating area in the kitchen for breakfasts and suppers
that's right yeah and then this more formal area over here
you could certainly fit a big enough table in to get everybody round for family gatherings and then this leads out to the garden does it
lovely view of the garden no scope for growing vegetables i don't think
no way that is a ridiculously small garden you've got no grass
so on the first floor we've got three bedrooms the first two are here at the front of the property
they look quite small don't they the bedrooms
they don't look a bad size to be honest
in the middle here we've got the family bathroom everywhere you go there's some eco friendly things being popped in you've got another light pipe dropping natural light into the room then finally on this floor at the back of the house this is bedroom three so i would suggest that maybe this was a really lovely room for drew then she could use that offshoot room as a play room or a toy store
that's a big room for drew to have
it is a big room drew gets the biggest room on our floor but i wouldn't want drew on a seperate floor to us no
so coming up to the second floor now this is the master bedroom worth pointing out that up here right up in the roof is where you've got the insulation it's recycled paper insulation and apparently it's fifty per cent more effective than normal insulating materials
that's good i like the fact that they're making use of recycled paper and it's better
if they're thinking this room is only going to take our bed where are we going to put our clothes not to worry because there's an extra little room here off the bedroom which you can only really use as a walk in wardrobe so it's really good extra storage then next door is the en suite bathroom so it has got an en suite it hasn't got a bath it's got a very funky shower
i'm just a bit concerned that there's no windows in any of the bathrooms
yes it's like the fresh air isn't opening the windows letting the fresh air in and letting the moisture out
that is a nasty view isn't it
joy blood has lived in the property for four years nice to see you so here we are nice central hallway i guess everything lies off in all directions so shall we go in this direction first what have we got through here this is our study
so this is your sitting room
yes rather grand feel with the doors there
and i'm noticing immediately you've got the ceiling rose and the cornicing are they mock period details they're trying to be kept in the tradition that the house style is they will love the patio doors the fact that you can open out
it's lovely on a summer's evening yes have those open very nice
i do like the idea of having the patio leading out onto the garden it's ideal with drew in and out in summer that'd be really good
goodness i see it all looks very sparkly and new when did you put this in joy
about fifteen months ago
so you've created loads more work space you've reconfigured the whole thing the most important thing is that you've left space for the table
i just see willow and drew running round and round there while you're cooking in the middle
let's go through here so this is your dining room very important room for my family your table looks like it's at least an eight seater
it is definitely i've had ten round it so yes plenty of space yeah excellent for entertaining
yeah so we could fit ten people round perfect for family christmases
so upstairs we've got four bedrooms the first of which is at the front of the property it's a good size double that's quite a big room it's a nice size isn't it so next up down the corridor is the master bedroom it isn't a bad size i think it probably would take mark and vanessa's king size bed
that doesn't even look as big as the previous bedroom that's the master
and it has got an en suite bathroom it's not huge but it's definitely got everything that you need
and it's got a window yes it has
so in the middle here is the third of the bedrooms this is definitely the smallest maybe a good room for little drew to start out in and then on this side of the house so back at the front we've got bedroom number four that's definitely a double and there's space for storage in there this almost is the piece de resistance this is the family bathroom and it's absolutely huge as you can see two windows and plenty of space for the bath a shower cubicle you could almost get another shower cubicle in this corner so they could have dual family showering
nice size so popping out of the kitchen
which leads out onto this patio area which is part of the work that joy's done out here in the garden it's also worth pointing out that a the garden is south west facing so that's really lovely for getting the sunlight it also means that you could site some solar panels on the roof there
even space for some solar water heating panels as well great
i'd say there's plenty of space out here joy had already thought of putting a vegetable patch and she's already done a bit of digging and put in some composting bins which i know mark and vanessa will really approve of
it's just what we need isn't it nice big garden
i liked it it's worth investigating
we'll put that on the yes pile definitely like that one nineteen thirties house no don't like it at all too much to do definitely no reepham house there were things i really liked about this house but i think they seemed to have copped out of going the whole hog so i'll put this on the maybe and come back in a second pasture house in lee definitely like the house love the garden but power station no so definitely no for that one
eco house or mystery house
we'll go for the mystery house and hill top house at waddington yes definitely
so two older properties have won the day i go to meet mark and vanessa at the mystery house in hough on the hill with no shops and just a pub here this is a very peaceful location definitely no a roads or power stations here and just a mile down the road is a larger village with more amenities this modernised period cottage is on the edge of the village and is in tip top condition any leftover money could go on installing all those energy saving gadgets and being fifty grand under budget there's a fair bit of cash to play with right here we are what are your first impressions from the outside
looks very nice not detached obviously but it looks nice clean
only a single garage but it does look a very nice house
as you can see it's got a good deep front garden it's well off the road so perfect for drew let's get inside and have a proper look around follow me right come in come in nice tiles on the floor it's a period house but i think you'll see as we go around it's been it's been sort of renovated so it feels very solid that's the sitting room
like the beams it's nice nice and pale bright i'm not sure we could fit both our sofas in here
they've got a good sized sofa there and you could put something along the whole of that wall i like the fire
ceilings are a bit lower than i thought they were going to be but they're not too low
crikey that's not low you could get a giant in here i think it's a really good spacious room you have got the patio doors out to the garden there we'll come back to look at the garden when we've seen the rest of the living accommodation
i like the doors this is the kitchen
that's quite interesting yes isn't this amazing
this is the original stove and the current owner tells me you can light it still and it's all got a bit painted up now but you can put the water in there and it heats in the top of there and there's the little tap on the side
fantastic that's excellent but stove aside what do you think of the proportions of the kitchen it's great i love the fact you can get a table in let's carry on
that's the stairs there you can have a look up in a minute just stick your heads in there
downstairs downstairs cloakroom and it's got a shower and a bath
this is the second reception room so we've got to think you wanted a separate dining room and a study so what do you think you'd go for
i get the impression this has been a snug cos of the fire
yes it is a cosy room it would make a nice dining room because of having the fireplace so from what you've seen inside so far very impressed out you come what do you think of this
deceptive from the front i like the fact that
there are two big buildings in the garden
yes hence where my study idea comes in because i thought you could convert that little shed there
i don't mind the idea of being in the garden peace and quiet
keep an eye on your chickens while you're working and there's room as well behind the little brick shed there vegetable patch i thought
yeah vegetable patch ideal
what about the roof do you think you could get a solar panel on that
yeah you could fit a solar panel on there it's got a nice pitch
fantastic thanks
drew will probably love this nice and girly and there's some really good views
that's a good double bedroom
yeah that'd be perfect for our parents to stay in perfect for another child
what so soon
yeah it's good to have a shower room upstairs or you'd have to go downstairs in the middle of the night to go to the toilet
hello had a good look round
we have thank you what do you think
it was very deceptive from the front very nicely decorated
i was surprised cos from the front we thought it was three bedrooms and when you get inside you find out there's actually four bedrooms and two bathrooms
i think it's great value for money anyway we're going to see something very different next so let's head off to property number two so here we are we'll pause here for a moment because this is the garden to the side of the property
i like that garden think you'd get a few veg in there
it's nice beams it is very nice
these beams look good don't they yeah
so this is the room i thought you could maybe use as your dining room
yes good for a dining room
and then obviously we've got a lot more rooms downstairs than in the previous house we've got your second reception room here
oh yes we thought about the study for this yeah
this is certainly big enough obviously the bigger the better
this seems quite big wow this is big it's nice i remember the chandeliers now
what do you think of them mark would you keep them i think i might get rid of them but now don't be trying to tell me you can't get your sofas in here
no this is a very nice sized living room this is a nice sized living room
so do you feel so far that you like it enough to be able to see beyond how the current owner has decorated
definitely yeah you have to do that don't you just to put your mark on things yeah
so what would your vision be for this room
we'd just probably turn it down a bit make it a bit more traditional
yeah i think a bit less ostentatious right so
back across the hallway straight ahead vanessa you've got your utility area
great just what i needed
and behind me downstairs loo right the kitchen modern kitchen
i like the units these are nice yeah
so actually you're saying ooh lovely modern kitchen like the new floor the clean lines actually you're tending towards the modern even though we're looking round a very old period house yes
i like that mix of old traditional character features and modern convenience appliances and nice clean lines to go with it
this certainly is a really big bathroom it's massive as big as it looked on the laptop
it is definitely but i just don't like it i don't like the tiles and the carpet it hasn't got a shower so we'd have to rip it out and start again
oh wow this is a fantastic space
it's a good space a bit creepy but perhaps we could do the wine making down here
no you want a big t. v. screen leather sofa fantastic all me games consoles it'll be excellent
no no no
so mark and vanessa you've seen both the houses so on the day which proved to be the best
i think this house proved to be
yeah i think this house was definitely yeah i thought that the mystery house was an absolutely certainly loved the decoration and the view out to the country but it didn't seem to be much bigger than the house we're moving from
unlike this one of course which has got bags of space so do you like it enough to put in an offer today
i would be very tempted to put in an offer despite the fact there's a lot of maintenance to do and there's a lot of work that needs doing but i don't like it enough to put an offer in
it doesn't do it for me i'm afraid
so basically mark you like it
i like it yeah but vanessa you're not sold no not at all
often it is about gut reaction when you walk into a house definitely i think that in a way you're so focussed on your eco warriorism that you're almost a little bit blurred on what you're looking for in a house so i think my advice would really be to start off my focussing on your absolutely essential lists for your property and then add the eco friendliness on top of it i think that might help you to really define your search which hopefully will eventually turn up the right property i can't wait to find out where you turn out and whether you get the sheep and the goats so i wish you both the best of luck
curse for chronic diseases but critics say it is immoral
this is ethically wrong and almost
don't ban it think to do so would really inhibit britain's ability to be the world leader in stem cell research and would send the wrong message these cell lines will be used by research groups throughout the world to generate new therapies for disease therapies we simply don't have at the current time
in a rare debate free of party politics on a matter of conscience m. p.'s are deciding the future direction of british science some think hybrids immoral
this is ethically wrong and almost certainly medically useless or if not useless there is no evidence
treatments and to hold off means that we actually take a precautionary principle which actually in effect will kill all of those people who could potentially be saved
it is very hard because they are children it is very very hard they are so injured

defence secretary's policy on tax david cameron's policy on tax remains the same that he will try and cut our tax bills as and when the economy is growing faster than public spending what was interesting about what he said today is he is not going to promise voters a shopping list of efficiency savings that can be made from government spending because he is recognising voters don't find that credible instead he is saying if we want to save money we have to reduce the burden on the state so bills for the state are smaller we need to make the public services more efficient and by thus doing we can save money and at the end of process will be able to raise taxes the bottom line is he wants to talk about tax when labour are on the back foot over tax and many people here are feeling the pinch of rising prices
one of the most crucial by elections in recent years how is the rest of the campaign shaping up
well all of the parties are fighting hard just three days out they all want to make the most of what they possibly can labour are trying to hold on to their seven thousand majority here they're doing it in two ways bun which emphasising their candidate's skwropbg hrefity within labour she is the daughter of the labour m. p. who died prompted this election the key problem they have is they're attacking the conservative candidate as a tory toff and that's not going down well

garden the idea of the path from liverpool to where he ended up i think it's beautiful
green roofs green walls chelsea is also a seedbed where new ideas are sown
it's inspirational to see what you can do in a small this is not an enormous stand
and among the ideas this year is rescuing our front gardens from the blight of offstreet parking and wheelie bins bins dominate the landscape at the

a little bit but thaeus what the garden is all about it's an incredibly stimulating space for them
for the right to prove that modern british cooking is up there with the best in the world half of our chefs have fallen in the fight and we're now down to our final magnificent seven this week it's our national finals and together with the judges you're going to decide which of our regional champions will have the honour of cooking for the world's finest chefs at heston blumenthal's banquet at the gherkin every day you'll be helping to select the winning dish for each course by voting after every show today you're going to be choosing the starter the first course must be outstanding as it'll set the standard for the entire meal and heston is expecting the ultimate dining experience
it's important to show the rest of the world how good our cooking is because it's that good also i happen to be proud to be british
it's day one of the finals and the seven victorious chefs from the regional heats are descending on the great british menu kitchen to do battle birmingham's glyn purnell and jason atherton from london and the south east arrive early only to find that northerner nigel haworth and stephen terry from wales have beaten them to it
hey guys how are you
some of our contestants are meeting for the first time while others are old comrades in arms
looking well fit
next to arrive are chris horridge from the south west and scotland's champion tom kitchin
how are you doing hi jason how's things chris nice to meet you
morning gents
last but not least is danny millar who will be fighting northern ireland's corner
how's it going all right nice to meet you
they may be smiling now but they're all here in deadly earnest every one of them is a top chef and determined to win a place at the banquet but at least three of them won't make it
we're at the sharp end of it now this is where if you mess up it's game over really everyone's gonna be so focused now
i don't do anything for a silver medal or a bronze medal i always go for the gold there's no point competing at this level if you don't feel you can go all the way
the first hurdle they have to surmount is our panel of judges oliver peyton prue leith and matthew fort it's their job to scrutinise the starters and award them marks out of ten but today's winner will be decided by combining the judges' scores with your votes the judges' marks will count for fifty per cent of the total and the public vote will make up the other half we'll explain how to vote later on and the all important results will be revealed on friday but how important is the starter course to heston
it is the curtain raiser it's the dish that's going to set the tone for the rest of the meal it's the dish that is hopefully gonna get the judges rubbing their hands with excitement
the seven chefs have a tough day ahead of them but before they're allowed to start cooking they're summoned by the judges for a pep talk
welcome to the judges' chamber this is where it starts getting serious
in all the competitions we've had this has been by far the highest quality of food
some of you may have exercised the option to change one of your dishes and maybe tinkered with one of the other ones it will be interesting for us to see
i have to say that nothing you've done so far counts now it's what you're going to do that matters not what you did last time
you have the talent we have the appetite so very good luck to you all
thank you see you later
well the judges will get their first taste of the delights on offer very soon but in the kitchen doubts are already beginning to surface
i'm thinking i'd like to change my dishes now i'm here
it's that slight sense of insecurity creeping in
and they're starting to think about the banquet too if they win through they'll have to prove themselves to the best chefs in the world
it is a lot to live up to the last thing we want is them coming over travelling all the way around the world and saying it wasn't that good it's got to be good yeah
it's been decided that the scottish regional winner tom kitchin and jason atherton representing london and the south east will cook their starters first michelin starred tom kitchin is a feisty young chef who works with the freshest seasonal produce and bold ingredients in the regional heats tom cooked a breakfast platter of wild boar sausage topped with a crispy pig's ear and a quail's egg he completed the dish with grilled tomato stuffed mushroom haricot beans and pancetta
it's got am amount of tongue in cheek a bit of humour in there it's a very tasty dish it looks good i think that could be my trump card
jason atherton is one of gordon ramsay's proteges he's won his own michelin star with stylish british tapas food built around superb flavours and textures jason set out his stall in the heats with an original take on a sandwich plate a twenty first century b. l. t. in a glass and a croque monsieur with truffles which the judges found both smart and innovative
it's a modern take on something we eat a lot of in this country sandwiches so we'll see
but before the chefs fire up the stoves the judges call jason and tom into the chamber again to discuss their starters
have either of you changed either dish mine's staying the same i'm sticking with the same dish
when i created the menu i thought that wasn't going to be as strong cos i didn't know if people would get it
with yours would be that we all thought it was quite big
the trouble there is the components are so small anyway to have the components of the breakfast cutting them down i don't know quite how
i had no trouble in eating it all
it was a delicious dish a really great dish
so this is it the finals of great british menu are about to begin
well tom here we are
the first dish to go to the judges will be tom's wild boar breakfast it's a feast of a fry up which could be a problem for another of our magnificent seven chris horridge who insists that food should be both tasty and healthy but he is curious about this
have you got duxelle in your mushrooms
a little duxelle scottish cheddar on top a little fried tomato i made herb bread crumbs yeah
it's early days and chris didn't criticise it at all but then he hadn't seen the rest of it including tom's take on home made baked beans and of course the fried boar sausage jason's dish is high fat too
chris will have a fit if he sees me putting all this in oil butter fatty bacon
surely it's about pleasure food
that's right i still allow myself to eat the nicer things in life i still like a bacon sandwich on a sunday morning of course
but this is a starter and as the judges said it shouldn't be too substantial
do think that's a lot of meat for a starter i've cut it down i can't go any less than this anyway
ah so tom did listen to the judges as he should if he wants to get to the gherkin on goes the boar's head sausage and the winner of the central heat glyn purnell is fascinated
it's got all the elements of a breakfast but with a lot more sophistication it looks really nice
jason also seems impressed tom's setting a very high standard
wow look at that beautiful oh well apart from my starter i hope it wins you're a good lad
this course could be tom's best chance of getting to the banquet he's scaled the dish down as the judges suggested but will they still like it
it's shrunk
there's a picture of a man who's just been shoved in the door of weight watchers
i think it looks absolutely wonderful crunchy pig's ear crunchy pig's ear
it's the porky scratchings of paradise
last time the pig's ear was the one thing that wasn't perfect it was a bit tough and bendy this is beautifully crunchy
i would love that for a first course
this is a very smart post modern humorous take on the great british breakfast
i don't necessarily think a chef who has little knowledge of the great british greasy spoon is going to understand the humour of it
heston might be the only person apart from us who actually gets the joke
let's forget about it being a joke let's just judge it on whether this is a delicious dish and tell me that it's not
this is not a summer dish this is a dish one would like to have before one goes out caber tossing in the morning
well i think you've got me there because i have to confess i don't think this is the most summery dish we've had but it's pretty damn nice
so not bad but it's not just the judges who are scrutinising the food today tom can expect searching criticism from his rivals too
i would have probably put that there cos there's a lot of work gone into that i like to see that i thought he would have maybe cornelled that on top
well stephen may fault the presentation but it's time they got stuck in
that tomato chutney is delicious
it's nice actually yeah i like it because it got a nice touch of a sense of humour yeah which is quite nice
it may be witty but does it tick all the boxes
d'you think it's fine dining as such
no i don't think so no i don't think it's the right dish for the banquet
the reason why we have full english breakfast is it sets us up for the day there's another three courses after this so the judges have to be very careful on what they pick as the next three dishes because otherwise it's gonna be
well it's no surprise that healthy eating advocate chris has reservations about this fry up but back in the kitchen tom's still confident
this is the food that i enjoy eating the pig's head the ears it's interesting it's using the whole of the animal and we'll see how it does you know
and we're about to find out as the judges are ready to give their scores
it is a dish which appeals primarily to the british sense of humour and i don't really think that french or spanish or italian or american chefs are gonna pick up on that so on that basis i'm afraid i'm only gonna give it a seven
who says that the french and the americans won't get the joke of course they'll get the joke the only thing they know about british food is that the breakfast is great
we'll invite them back for breakfast no so they'll know about breakfast so i am giving it a nine any breakfast any day that's the one for me but just not at the gherkin but still it's an eight
back in the kitchen our second chef jason atherton is pulling in a crowd as he makes his starter and tom's taking a suspiciously keen interest in his truffles
what are you gonna do with the trimmings i'll give them to you and you can put them on your lunch menu typical scot typical scot eh
that's what a lot of chefs are doing now it's a bit tongue in cheek bit of a play on words but that's modern british where we going i think so
i know taste is the most important thing in cooking but if you're eating with your eyes there i think you could be on to a winner
do you want to pop these on for me tom of course so basically just like that
well they may be rivals but it's good to see a bit of camaraderie now and then
well done mr. atherton i think that looks absolutely fantastic
tom is obviously a fan of jason's modern sandwich plate but it's the judges whose opinions count now
very happy the way it went out it looked great tasted how i wanted it to taste i'm happy they should be happy
god this competition is
hotting up is very competitive
i'm sitting here watching that dish going down and thinking you know
wow they're trying very hard aren't they this is a very cool dish isn't it
i mean really cool they're sort of cooking like a mathematical theorem everything's been worked out so precisely and that raises a question mark in my mind where's the heart where's the heart
i think it's there because if this is anything like last time it tastes absolutely delicious jason is one hell of a cook and it's a joke and i love a joke should be good and it is
my only concern about this dish is its britishness i don't feel g. b. running anywhere in its veins is my
i mean this is a brilliant exercise in skill i mean it's really an exquisite beautiful wonderfully balanced piece of cooking
come on danny don't be shy
the gannets are gathering for their share of the feast
i could see that happening i mean there's no doubt that this is cutting edge
yeah you know i think this is what jason's all about
it's refreshing i tasted the lettuce earlier separately it's quite strong but it's not intended to be eaten on its own no when it's eaten altogether it's perfect
i think it is a nice way to start a meal
i sense a but coming
this actually stands on its own i think as cutting edge very nice very interesting nice flavours in the jelly and stuff like that this area here is this is france this is belgium
so that's another dish on chris's hit list
you can't deny it's a cracking dish
it's a good intro
exactly whets your appetite doesn't it that gets the creative juices flowing it's like what's next
i think it's a wise choice yeah purely on the back of its creativity its inventiveness
so how will the judges score this modern take on sandwiches
it was jason on a plate it was michelin star cooking very precise very witty it was a real pleasure to eat but i didn't think that was british enough so i gave it an eight
i mean that was a sensational dish at every level in terms of flavour in terms of texture in terms of visual style but in the end i just felt where's the heart in this the calculation got in the way of to me the final ounce of pleasure which i expected to extract from it so i'm going to give it an eight
i didn't feel great britain running through its veins was my only problem however i still give it an eight
so that's two down but there are five other chefs to go and any one of them can be the winner the decision will be down to you because you'll be able to vote at the end of the show your vote will be added to the judges' choices to determine whose starter will be served at the gherkin and as all the chefs will be up for the public vote every day they can win more than one course so while some of the chefs can relax others must focus on preparation and there's a definite sense of competition in the air now
a lot of good pedigree chefs out there know their onions so i need to put my head down and produce the goods
conversation soon turns toward the gherkin
nice for four different chefs to go it would i think rather than somebody going with two dishes and then two other
i think after meeting everybody as well it'd be great if you don't actually get there to commis for whoever would be great just to be there on the night
it would be funny
it's time for two more chefs to face the judges and they're both very experienced the regional winner for wales stephen terry lives in abergavenny he's won michelin stars in the past but now prefers to cook no nonsense food and champions seasonal produce in the heats he made asparagus with goat's cheese dressing and welsh ham so it's a real contrast with the other dishes we've seen today
my starter's very it's quite classical it's interesting but i'm not sure if it's different enough to be honest with you i'm not pinning my hopes on my starter
going head to head with stephen is the north's regional champ nigel haworth a michelin star holder for twelve years now nigel believes in minimum ingredients and maximum flavour in the heats the judges thought his lancashire hot pot salad with lamb red cabbage and sweetbreads was dainty and delicious will the pressure of the finals make it harder
i'm very excited you know i've got a few butterflies which i always think is good
our judging panel want to talk to nigel and stephen before they start cooking their dishes
good to see you hello have you changed anything about them at all
nothing you haven't you all so loved it we did love it
we did like it very much indeed we loved both of them
when i asked you recommended last time and i thought you were going to say to change my starter
why did you think we wanted you
i didn't know fully if it was what you were looking for in terms of the brief and it was modern enough or technical enough
what i feel funnily enough about both dishes is that they were absolutely delicious and they both did what i wanted them to do but having seen everybody else's you get blown away by amazing presentation or fantastic innovation or a new witty twist on something
was prue suggesting that our veteran chefs should jazz their dishes up a bit i wonder
here we are steve
once again hah
stephen's asparagus dishes will be the first to go for judging and as he starts preparing his vegetables he realises that he and nigel have something in common
we are actually the two oldest competitors in the competition
we are it does make you feel old i look at people like jason and i think of them as young kiddies
he used to work for me he's in his mid thirties now and it's like blimey
i know what he means but right now he's got other things to worry about like cooking something that one of our judges has a pet hate about
what are you doing with the goat's cheese it's like a dip with asparagus
it's not all about matthew there's three of them
that's what i said if he doesn't like it he can leave it
mind you he can eat anything as far as i know aye
well matthew does like his food it's true but all three judges have discerning palates and they're quite capable of rewarding substance over style if a dish is really good
where does this one sit steve as far as your four dishes go is this one of your favourites
i like it and i think it works but i think in comparison to some of the starters that are going off today i wouldn't say it's going to be top of the list
so which ones are you concerned about mine of course
intriguing yes but stephen has a very different style of cooking it's too late to change his starter now
the essence of this dish is that it's not so much it's the eating of it as opposed to looking at it some of these dishes are going to be glass dishes and jellies and things like that i love all that but i just didn't chose to do it in this instance i might lose out in that department
but does his old employee jason agree
i've known stephen for years i don't expect lots of frilly garnishes he leaves that to the london boys
stephen's dish is almost ready some of the asparagus is griddled but he likes to make things up as he goes along
not quite sure that's going to cook on there just be careful
the salad gets a quick spin and a touch of dressing then he deep fries his crumbed asparagus and he's ready to plate up there goes the goat's cheese and finally some crispy carmarthen ham
we're there simple tasty best of luck
so was stephen right to stick with his dish matthew has been known to applaud goat's cheese if it's used in a creative way
he's changed it he's put the goat's cheese in a pot
it does look better for that
it looks neater tidier
i think it was far more impactful the first time round
we hadn't seen so many other amazing things but i still think it's lovely and it smells good
i'm now not convinced you've gone off goat's cheese again i jolly well have it has both the texture and the flavour of polyfilla as far as i'm concerned
isn't that odd that you thought so differently last time round
he served it differently he didn't have it quite en masse it was dribbled over in much smaller quantities
oh right there are more either refined dishes
or more elaborate dishes available to us to chose from
if i'm sitting at the top of the gherkin with some of the finest chefs in the world peering over my shoulder judging me by judging the food that i've judged then i would say this ain't gonna make it
it's more modern and more cutting edge
i would say the competition is getting fiercer and i think this is a very nice dish a very good dish except for the goat's cheese i am not going to love this goat's cheese
i thought we have such a triumph that you finally liked goat's cheese
not this time round but what will the other chefs make of it
in my opinion i don't think it is cutting edge
it's not a dish you'd put on a platter and say this is where modern british food is going
the food he's cooking here is highly regional to wales all the ham and the welsh asparagus how modern can you make that do you know what i mean
jason's loyally sticking up for his old boss but unfortunately for stephen he's not on the judging panel and he's in a minority there seems to be a consensus that while this dish is good it isn't cutting edge british cooking
in comparison to some of the things i'm going to see today it's not a technical dish but it is what it is it's quality goat's cheese asparagus you can't do too much to it i don't feel
if i'd had this in steven's pub i'd be very happy with it as a first course but as a dish for the gherkin it isn't even a starter and it did remind me of why i hate goat's cheese i'd prefer to pull my teeth out than have that again anyway on the basis of that i'm going to give it five
i did think it was more of an informal dish than we're looking for so i gave it a six
i just think it didn't go the extra yard and i'm going to give it a six on that basis
but now it's time for nigel howard's starter
tweaking i've got butterflies and i look calm i don't know how i do it i tell you
there speaks a true lancastrian and he's modernising a traditional dish in the form of a hotpot salad nigel is steaming his lamb and frying a mix of carrots and onions once that's on the go he slices the chives for the salad and steven can't resist coming round to see what he's up against
spring onions in what's that in there
is that your lamb loin that's the lamb loin with the smoky onions how long do you steam that for now nine minutes i've put it on eight
i'm just going to check so it's another minute to go
he's got everything on the go now but he's rehearsed this dish and it's all under control with more years experience than any other chef in the finals he knows exactly what he's doing
is your money on this one
yeah it's one of the nicest dishes without doubt i'm hoping that it's going to hit the mark
so he's quietly confident and ready to plate up bang on schedule the lamb sits nicely on a little red cabbage and he tops his sweetbread with diced vegetables all it needs now is the salad and steven jokes that it's all too complicated for a banquet
reckon you could do that for fifty people yeah
a few final touches and his starter is ready to go
it's a very deconstructed hotpot isn't it yeah
it is hotpotsalad
but no sooner have the waiters left the kitchen than steven spots something on the countertop
what's that there is that on then yeah you didn't put them on no what was it supposed to be on then yeah just on the side you forgot or you made a conscious decision no i forgot
so will the judges notice that the crisps are missing
i noticed there's no potato on this dish so how it quite covers the description of lancashire hotpot
i missed a component i can't do anything about h. n. i. i. through the door hasn't it
so has his mistake ruined his chances
it's almost slightly incongruous to think of something described as a lancashire hotpot salad should come in so exquisite a form that sweetbread is as good as sweetbread gets in terms of taste
so delicate and beautiful it's absolutely an explosion of flavour when it hits your mouth but i don't think that's a very good tasting piece of meat
it's interesting that lamb because it's quite tough and yet it has not a lamby flavour at all
there's virtually no flavour at all
i think this is so good that you don't need the lamb because i think the rest of the plate is delicate
he's called it lancashire hotpot sweetbread i would have been perfectly happy and quadrupled the size of the sweetbread
last time we were remarking on how beautiful the lamb was
it was wonderful lamb last time that's the trouble with exams on the day you've got to get it right
some mixed reactions from the judges then but what will his rivals make of it
no sauce with it
a wee bit of red cabbage it was
i really like that it's clever it's witty
it's unusual to have lamb as a starter but it would work because it's so light and delicate
such a british ingredient i think it'd work well show chefs around the world what we can do i think it's good we can't criticise will we get chris in
where is chris but whatever he'd say about it nigel knows his incomplete hotpot salad will be judged as it stands
when you start to go you're putting all the components on i perhaps rushed it a little bit and just missed the crisp but
nigel is a really talented chef and it was beautifully conceived beautifully executed all the ingredients went together very well i had one real quarrel with it and unfortunately it was with the main ingredient which was the lamb the lamb had no flavour so i'm giving it a six
i would have tasted the lamb ditched the lamb and made a sweetbread dish because it would probably have won it the sweetbreads were that good i don't think there's any excuse for the lamb it was terrible i agree with you and it's a six
to deconstruct a hotpot in that way i wasn't sure if it was lancashire light or lancashire terribly elegant and sophisticated but in the end however you dress it up it did depend upon the quality of the lamb to some extent and i'm afraid like you two i found it without flavour and without flavour and without favour so on that basis i'm also going to give it a six
our veteran chefs are done now and nigel should be able to relax
happy yeah good i forgot a component but y'know
yeah steve remembered it didn't you
i just wondered what they were
so that's four chefs who've cooked their starters now but that still leaves three who are equally determined we'll show you the judges' order of preference at the end of the show but then the phone lines will open and you can say who you want to win the public vote carries equal weight with the judges in deciding who triumphs in the starter course chris and glyn are relaxing before they have to cook their starters
look at this catch this pigeon for the perfect flying start that's it
is it a sign with chris cooking pigeon next i can't believe that
it actually says the future of food is gluten free dairy free sugar free it's in black and white
also in black and white is stop the pigeon vote for the trifle
he's irrepressible that boy but now it's time for our last three and very different chefs glyn chris and danny the champion of the central region glyn purnell is an imaginative chef whose food shows flair and flavour for his starter he cooked a rabbit trifle and pea custard and a sweet toffee rabbit lollipop the judges thought it was exquisite and delicately put together
it's almost like a terrine in a glass really it's a safe dish but it's got that quirkiness my sense of humour in it so i think it fits right into the category
the northern irish winner danny millar has been cooking for twenty years and settled on an uncomplicated style based on fresh local produce in the heats the judges thought his dish of sweetbreads with peas broad beans and morel mushrooms was courageous but a little unexciting
it'll have to be very bad to get this one wrong i want to start off well keep it nice and simple go in easy
our last chef south west champion chris horridge is another michelin star holder he believes that food should look good taste good and do you good he knows a lot about nutrition and combines his scientific knowledge about ingredients with first rate cookery skills to create eye catching dishes in the heats chris made cured wild pigeon with broccoli sprouts and omega rich seeds for his starter and the judges thought his dish was both elegant and full of flavour
i think it's more than just a fancy little bit of food on a plate i'm taking my food in a completely different area to everybody else i'm not saying it's the only cog in the future of food but it's certainly gonna play a part
like the four chefs who've cooked already danny chris and glyn are called into the judging chamber
tell me about the rabbit have you done any changes
have you kept the lollipop i've kept the lollipop yeah
you might even get two each this time two lollipops may be just one lollipop too many i was thinking of serving two smaller ones rather than one big one
danny you cooked sweetbreads with morels have you changed that at all
yes this time luckily enough it's a bit further into the season and i've got my roe venison sweetbreads they're just about ripening so i have enough for you to sample
venison sweetbreads i have never had they're a treat particularly i felt chris's pigeon with the seeds that was really fascinating because it was very modern felt so healthy at the end of it didn't you pru yes it was healthy but that wasn't the point about it for me it tasted fantastic
forgive me interrupting but we have still to eat this all over again so the competition is still wide open
and you're using the loin bone as part of your stick like the lollipop
i'm gonna use cocktail sticks for the lollipop and i'm also gonna serve the rack the liver and kidney as a salad on top of it with the gingerbread
so it's quite a simple dish then
glyn has given himself a fiddly task these are pretty small cuts of meat and stephen wonders what part they play in the dish
how does that sit in your glass it sits on the top or on the side
the lollipop goes on the side and the racks go all in the top it can be a bit of a dish that you dive in and roll your fingers up then finish with the spoon which is what food's all about really very modern that's for sure
best of luck you mean that do you i do mean that good lad i mean that wholeheartedly
he's got his fingers crossed here
glyn's starter has caused quite a stir and it gives stephen even more reason to think he miscalculated
my starter in comparison to that is just pedestrian really the quality of it is fantastic but i think that's just cutting edge and i think that is what the judges are gonna be gravitating towards
glyn's ready to put the trifle together now the rabbit and olive jelly is topped with a layer of pea custard his rivals are all watching and jason wants to know how he thought of it
do you try and think of something a little bit witty and then dismantle it and try to build it up into something
i think so i've got a bit of a sense of humour anyway so i like to my mum says so anyway i try to inject a little bit of a sense of humour in some of my cooking this just makes me smile a little bit
all he has to do now is drizzle some black olive juice over the top add the lolly and he's done
grab them just be careful they slide a bit these boys know what they're doing they're professionals there we go rabbit black olive pea trifle with rabbit lollipops bonne chance as they say across the water
now the judges loved this dish in the heats and it's clearly intrigued glyn's fellow chefs so is he feeling confident about it
i think it's just such a witty trifle isn't it
i don't think it tastes as good as the last time
it's sweeter mm
the lollipop all i'm getting is the sweet taste of the lollipop
i'm going to try and get the jelly and the rabbit without any peas on it like that very little pea see
i wonder if he's added some sugar that's much better
if it had been that much jelly and rabbit and then a tiny layer of peas it would have been better
in its first incarnation it would've been a great dish to go through to the gherkin
it's always been a risky dish because this sort of joke if you like if it doesn't come off gastronomically if it doesn't come off in the mouth a flavour then it's just a joke so the balance between failure and terrific success are very narrow
so it didn't really come off this time but what was different
we're talking about seven craftsmen here and it's like anything there are elements of pressure chris can cook you can cook then jason comes over the pressure's there it's nothing to do with the judges
and the pressure isn't over yet because his fellow chefs are getting stuck in in the privacy of the tasting room
it's really good i really like it it's the kind of food i'd cook
it's a trendy dish it's not something i would serve but i appreciate it
so did the judges get it all wrong
i love the jelly and the pea i'm not so much about the sweetness i think the peas are sweet enough yeah
but will they say all that to his face
it wasn't really that bad
i can't believe you said that
that's why i never come in earlier because
the fights we've had what you've achieved there is i like it it's fantastic
i want to try and make people smile if i made all three of you smile i've done the job
but the chefs agree with the judges that it was a little too sweet so how does glyn feel now that the plates have come back from the chamber
i was pretty pleased with it the guys tried it they seemed pretty pleased with it the judges i'm not sure
it was so sweet that it might have been a trifle it could almost have had custard on it but the truth of the matter is it is still an original and quite wonderful dish because it was a little bit too sugary i couldn't give it the marks i wanted but it's still a great dish and i'm going to give it a seven
there is an example of something where it's a great idea and it could've been amazing but one little thing makes it go wrong for me this was probably a nine dish which is now six
it reminded me of one of those photographs where someone jogs your elbow at the moment you're pressing the button and everything goes blurry so on that basis i'm afraid it's a six from me
but back in the kitchen demand for glyn's dish has outstripped supply
glyn where's my trifle the lad you promised me the lad smashed it is that it all of them gone
i want to taste that as well i didn't get a mouthful of it
that's it no trifle i always preferred sat anyway
sat bains was the chef glyn defeated in the heats there are only two contestants left to cook now and danny millar is hoping his novel combination of sweet breads and morel foam will get him to the gherkin he's gone for a very unusual main ingredient and chefs are always interested in something different
two wee bad boys there see they're not fully developed yet they grow up not much bigger than lambs but it's a young venison i got enough for us to sample hopefully chef can get a taste plus the judges
are there spices on there yes it's a little bit of morel powder they look great yeah they are i've never had them before
the veal and venison sweetbreads are dipped into a water bath for a few minutes and while danny waits for them to cook he slices his morel mushrooms he believes in unfussy recipes based on the freshest ingredients possible it's a fairly easy dish to cook so he has plenty of time to select the best peas one by one
obviously food cost is great for chefs are you actually counting per pea per person
the sweetbreads are now cooked to perfection and chris comes over to see them again
do you know if there's a physical flavour difference
it's a little bit different but it's not very much
right it's not like gamey or no no
just because it's only available one month of the year i like to use it
danny carefully squeezes out the pea puree and makes sure that each spoon gets a helping of the venison sweetbreads on goes a generous serving of morel mushrooms he whips up a morel foam too delicately tosses the shoots and beans in a tasty dressing and arranges everything on the plate
so to the guest like that yes
nice one mate very nice
it's good to see them go
danny thinks he's done a good job with his sweetbreads and fresh shoots but is the dish altogether too simple and is it contemporary enough for heston's cutting edge banquet
down the hatch
i think it had a morel on top which rather unbalances things it difficult to taste the sweetbread
i was just about to say that was my first venison sweetbread i think i think i'll refrain from saying that
reserve judgment on the venison
well i remember last time we didn't think it had huge visual wow i mean it's not something that you're going to say fantastic presentation but it looks fresh and summery and it does it tastes lovely
this is a bauhaus dish isn't it less is more definitely well i could actually see this having a place at the gherkin and it would not be an extravagant statement it wouldn't be all whistles all singing all dancing but they'd eat this with a smile
are we now at a point at the proceedings where you think nice is going to be sufficient to get through
i think it is better than nice i think this
that's not what you're saying this is a grand dish blah di blah blah no no no
we are considering things in an entirely different light and i don't think that we need necessarily to have the visual razzle dazzle and one's taste buds being bludgeoned into submission by one thousand one tastes
there's a marvellous bunch of chefs here in this competition this is one of those dishes which isn't a modern looking dish
i mean they're all top chefs if one of them can't produce something which looks great which fits all the criteria and tastes fantastic and knocks everybody's socks off let's be a bit ambitious it won't do you're getting so excited prue yes i am god fantastic
but it sounds to me time for another course
well danny's dish certainly got prue exercised if for all the wrong reasons but they're queuing up for it in the kitchen
venison sweetbreads fantastic
just on the spoon yeah all on the spoon yeah
fresher i don't think there isn't a massive difference
and what do the chefs who aren't tasting it with danny think
i prefer the veal yeah without a doubt
it's a lovely dish but it's got classical overtones and isn't saying modern
it's got great flavours it's got good balance but it's not what the judges are looking for
so is tom right the judges are about to give their marks
it wasn't flashy maybe slightly under designed by some of the standards of other dishes but i thought it was really a beautiful thing to eat so i'm going to give it a seven
yes i mean i think it made up for its looks in flavour and i'll give it a seven
you know i would be very reluctant as i said to put this dish out in front of loads of foreign chefs as our first dish it just didn't look strong enough for me so on that basis i'll have to say it's a seven
our final chef out in the kitchen is raring to go there's no danger of the judges getting bored by repetition because he's serving pigeon he's heating some omega rich seeds with soy sauce and blending apricot with an alternative sugar xylitol to make a puree the other chefs are interested in his health conscious cooking but nigel is particularly impressed by the choice of bird
pigeon is such a wonderful product
its actually wild pigeon like cured in bird sap
cured in birch sap bird sap
birch tree birch tree sap
i thought you said bird sap then no no no
glyn seems a bit confused too
what's the philosophy behind what you're trying to achieve
the whole thing i'm actually trying to do is what i'm terming three dimensional cuisine which for me is basically it's about presentation flavour and the biggest area of interest i've actually got at this stage of time is nutrition i actually used no dairy no sugar no gluten and no gelatine throughout all my dishes of this event i'm trying to prove that you don't need all those things to have great tasting great looking food and to get to the stage i'm quite pleased because it seems to work you know which seems to suggest that maybe i might be on to something
well danny certainly seems impressed
so that way round guys that way facing you as the customer thank you very much
the slate tile of pigeon in birch sap wine is ready will the judges still see it as a high class modern meal or just as health food
if you'd have asked me about health and cooking you know it's bland i would have said yes but meeting you and talking to you and seeing what you produce isn't the case obviously i just love how this looks
it's lovely let's face it this is a sensational first course this is an obvious contender it is do you remember when i said that we've got seven top chefs here and if one of them can't hit all the buttons we are wasting our time this guy this is chris isn't it has hit every single button i mean it is fantastic you know every single taste is a pleasure and goes together beautifully of course it looks amazing
this is healthy it's healthy without being worthy
my problem with this dish is it breaks almost every canon of my personal credo it's light it's healthy but it is absolutely delicious no cream no butter and
and it would not be improved by cream and butter
no it would be ruined by cream exactly it's wonderful
you know any chef coming to the gherkin is going to be extremely excited to eat something like this because you know i've been in quite a few restaurants and this sort of thing does not pop up every day
it there's more modern british cooking like this then the future of british cooking is pretty bright
exactly
so has chris managed to convert the other chefs too
pigeon fight its way through i lost it for sort of a minute or a second or two
the puree is a bit overpowering yeah but the pigeon is lovely
look out he's behind you
don't be shy you're all bigger than me
what do we think guys honest opinions
i like the pigeon i like the seeds the only thing i'd say is there's probably a bit too much puree in relation to the meat because it was quite sharp
if i'd known the puree was the main ingredient i'd have said well the puree came out very well
chris we're definitely in agreement it's modern british food
but some of them just don't seem to be tuned to chris's way of thinking
i'm not surprised to see three chefs scratching their heads going maybe the fruit puree is too much etc they're not looking at it from the same angle as i am
i simply couldn't fault it as a piece of imagination as a piece of cooking in terms of flavour combinations it was at every single level a truly wonderful experience to eat i've no choice but to give it ten
to me it was an amazing dish i've had nothing like that ever before in this country i'd be proud to have it at the gherkin for that reason i'd give it a ten
i loved the fact it was as light as anything to eat and totally healthy without feeling at all worthy my slight niggle is that i didn't quite see what the violet leaves were for and petals the floral petals to be totally purist i'm going to give him nine which is my highest score
you're working hard
it's all over all the chefs can do now is wait and try to second guess the judges
top three jase glyn and the big man
nigel jason chris or tom i'm not sure
jason glyn chris
it's stiff competition is it not yeah
they don't have to wait long to find out the chefs have been summoned to the judges' chamber to hear the verdict
very good to see you all again i'm sure you're relieved to get the first course under your belt we're relieved to get under ours as well my belt is a good deal tighter this evening than this morning so in seventh place is stephen terry
well that won't surprise stephen considering what he was up against
it was never going to be anything more
in sixth place is nigel howarth
which must be a shock for him the other chefs really rated his hotpot
and in fifth place glyn purnell
that's a blow for glyn he thought he'd do better
he was nowhere near as good this time as the previous time
the lollipop all you could taste was carmelisation nothing else
it was a pity because i had such hopes for that dish
glyn's loss is someone else's gain and so in fourth place is danny millar
well i think danny will be pleased with that not a bad result at all
it is by pure coincidence that we have jason tom and chris all sitting on the stools in front this wasn't organised and it was very tough we found it impossible to separate two of you so tied in second place tom and jason atherton it simply means chris horridge yours was the finest dish on the day
thank you very much cheers guys
congratulations well done yeah well done
none of us had ever tasted anything quite like it before it was distinctly british it was modern it was seasonal chris it was a real triumph
to be that delicious and healthy i had to overcome a deep prejudice
are you starting to be converted matthew is that it
there are plenty of other dishes i ate with pleasure
i thought the whole colour arrangement on that piece of slate made the whole thing really pull together and taste well together thank you very much
tom and jason i must say two absolutely stunning pieces of cooking with a great deal of humour behind them this isn't the end of the story i'm not sure it's even the beginning of the end of the story there are three more courses to go you've set an extraordinarily high standard for yourselves it's only going to get harder for you and harder for us thank you all very much it's been a really grand day and a great privilege
thank you
one dish one win great statistic
so the judges have given their verdict on the starter courses but that only represents half of the final score your vote will represent the other half so it's up to you to ring in for the one you want to see served at heston's banquet at the gherkin the numbers to note down for when the lines open are as follows the lines open at the end of the show and close at eight p. m. tonight great british menu is conducted in line with the b. b. c.'s new code of conduct for competitions and voting so in seventh place is stephen terry but if you want to see his warm asparagus with welsh ham and melted goat's cheese dressing at the banquet call remember don't vote yet as the lines aren't open
it's not too technical it's easy to understand food it's very tasty and does what it says

destruction the earthquake had caused all around them for three days they were living rough on a tour bus and they were kept alive by the generosity of the local people around them who shared their rice with them
i came face to face with this chinese woman her face was swollen and her eyes were blood shot she had cuts and grazes and bruises she was hanging on to her daughter's neck and i looked into her eyes and she looked into mine and it was like why are you going we're injured and we wanted to go but that face will haunt me for the rest of high life
plenty more ahead i'm with some of london's up and coming songwriters learning what makes five great hit great hit now this is the olympic promise that the government has failed to deliver so far the film was part of the most ambitious promise of any bidding city to use the two thousand twelve games to inspire millions of youngsters to actively take up sport but the subsequent plan to make this happen still has not materialised much to the frustration of grass roots sporting bodies this on the very evening that the international olympic committee arrives in london
ready fence
the sport of arse tratic duls and musketeers aristocratic duels and muscleers but wouldn't expect it here in fulham but these children can't get enough of this olympic sport
allowed children to try out new sports they were overwhelmed with the response to fencing in one of the poorest boroughs
it has the reputation at being an elitist sport but here it is all sorts of children from all different places
there's no point going to a whole load of local authorities or to regional groups and saying look guys what have you got in mind in terms of marking the olympics there has to a proper nationally co ordinated strategy and there has to be some resource behind that strategy to ensure the best practises are followed throughout the country

teenager who died after a fall have today paid tribute to her calling her a loving caring person rosy meary from vauchall was found in from vauchall was found on monday an investigation is under way into the death of construction worker who was on snoop sneep an investigation is an investigation is being carried out on a man jurd after the collapse of skaflholding he was working on lil yeah ladele is taking islington council to court saying that to carry out same sex marriage would be against her religion lilian ladele for sixteen years a registrar but now at the centre of five lawsuit ms. ladele's job requires her to carry out same sex civil partnership ceremonies but she says it is against her religion so the council is stuck recognising the rights of one of hits employees but also those of seam sex partners ms. ladele gave this statement
if she is refusing to marry anybody elsely in this day and age then she is not really doing her job so perhaps she should resign
she is probably in the wrong job there should be an opportunity for anyone to marry regardless of gender and sexual persuasion
victory for ms. ladele could leave employers wide open to challenges from employees who say their beliefs stop them doing their jobs
there could be individuals who say they don't want to work with homosexuals or share the canteen with them obviously they'd have to put forward stronger arguments because it's not the same as marriage
well ms. ladele has beliefs that a lot of people have in london that marriage is for one man and one woman that is just her beliefs and there are plenty who agree and disagree if it is a conventionious issue but i don't think ms. ladele should be facing the sack because she has that view she is being threatened with the sack because she is is a christian
you say that some people would agree or disagree with same sex partnerships but it is her job to carry out
and she has done that job for sixteen's but the law changed if somebody applies for a job with the law as it is and you know what it is that is a different issue but if the law changes that is a different circumstances and no one leaves their human rights just because they work at town hall
that is a point no one is being denied a civil ceremony as a result of this she is not the only registrar in islington somebody else could perform this
marriages it is the local authority that has to provide them and it is being provided no one will be denied this but lilian ladele has been in this job for sixteen years and loves it i don't believe she should lose her job just on a christian issue
they didn't want to lecture a person who was gay or a doctor to say they didn't want to treat somebody who was game the service you provide should be without any sexual orientation to the person
but would a doctor refuse to treat someone who was homosexual
i'm sure they wouldn't but the point is if they have a particular belief on a religious issue they don't lose their job on that issue and they
well we are offering a number of unique and very special once in a lifetime opportunities across historic royal palaces including this spectacular tour of hampton court
why should somebody pay more perhaps a lot more to come up here
rather a good season at queens park rangers and fulham
people aren't buying so many c. d.'s and aren't sure what the industry will be but the one thing that will always be the commodity people need are great songs and london is a place where great songwriters congregate
songwriters can attend a week of workshops and have their creations critiqued by some of the best known names the event coincides with the
this week long event justinians about showcasing new talent it's about helping things with people like negotiating publishing deals and the all important creating a hit kathy dennis knows better than most what goes into a hit she has gone from performer to producer now artists like kylie get the
sound we have trees so bird song is another thing
this doctor believes the garden should have beneficial use
happening is this perfect storm where you have rising fuel and food prices electricity cuts a political transformation with the leader that people are uneasy about and then rhetoric and the truth of hundreds of thousands of zimbabweans coming over the border and the fact that the government has not done much either to address the problems in zimbabwe or more importantly i think for the people here to address the zimbabweans who come to south africa
i want to go now i am not happy you can see many people now they have problems like not people have the problem now now i am not happy i just go out to buy something it is problem now
do you feel you were better off in congo than you are in south africa
to blame this man says his south african neighbours turned on him
we were standing like that you know we laugh we share jokes inside they have something which
we know them as south africans
how much security are the security forces and police able
too careful to be to give you an illustration last night there was an attack on a specific building in one of our suburbs here in johannesburg the only reason was that there were foreign nations in that building and the only way one would know that is if they had some sort of understanding of what is happening at the local level for too long poor people in this country have felt they have dropped off the margins of the agenda so the anxioustys around poverty the anxieties around poverty and the hope for the future have grown enormously so the combination of those two things has brought about in a sense in this instance the
they would not have pre empted the attack here number one but number two i think that we are fast coming to the place where we need a sign of security on every street corner visible in the community to begin to start norm mallising having normalised the matter i think we are in a place where we must recognise that is like taking an anal g. e. sick the pain will disappear for a while
is not a wonderful omen it would be the right thing for south africa to relax some of those restrictions on the border particularly at the moment to suffering zimbabweans very vulnerable from all har rashment and poverty obviously the government is going to have to have discussions on many many levels if we are going to be ready
they want to help me but our government wants their help they must come by force
ordinary people of rangoon are travelling to stricken areas to do what they can to help the rulers seem more concerned about saving themselves than their people millions of people across china have paused for three minutes to mourn the victims of the earthquake a week after it struck air raid sirens sounded motorists blue their horns as the country came to a standstill it is the first of three national days of mourning with the olympic torch relay suspended the authorities say more than thirty four thousand people are known to have died with tens of thousands more missing custody hearings for four hundred sixty three children found living in a polygamist sect are starting shortly in texas the children were placed in foster care the authorities said they were forced into underage marriages by their fam lis the government has given approval to a series of proposals aimed to improve relations between the public and the military among the reminute r. menations are plans for a national armed forces day and making it an offence to discriminate against anyone wearing a military uniform now the boundaries of what is possible scientificly are pushed all the time by discoveries in britain the way has been cleared for scientists to use hybrid human animal embryos scientists say the research could save millions of lives critics say creating hybrid embryos tampers with nature and is immoral the aim is simple to bring britain's eighteen year old laws into line with scientific advances but the ethics involved are complex and emotive perhaps the most controversial issue debated by m. p.'s is whether to allow research using hybrid embryos to continue hybrid embryos are part animal part human the stem cells can be used to study alzheimer's or parking sons i allows pioneering research now which could have benefits later
don't ban it to do so would really inhibit britain's ability to be the world leader in stem cell research and would send the wrong message these will be used by scientists throughout the world to develop new term therapies for disease
the trouble is scientists cannot say when the research will bear fruit and critics believe the basic concept of mixing animal and human
we must allow both the this sort of research and adults stem cell research to continue and allow scientists and their funders to choose which one to go for and insure the regulator in this country which regulates the research requires scientific and ethical justification
the main headline grabber if you like was the proposal to ban all research on hybrid embryos that has been comprehensively defeated one hundred seventy six in say it in favour of the van and three hundred thirty six against banner so banner the second amendment of the bill has also been rejected i think this indicates the trend it looks as if things are going in favour of continuing the research
as you mentioned in your report britain is ahead of the pack in this and takes the lead in stem cell research
it has done it has a reputation for being the vanguard of this new research different countries tree these issues differently they all have their own line in the sand so catholic countries tend to be conservative on abstract research but would be more in favour of anything that helps i. v. f. treatment there is an element of competition enormous if a country bounces kind of research then the experts involved in it will go elsewhere bans this so while we have been dealing with technical and erudite issues the bottom line is just because scientists can do something should politicians and ethics professor has allow them to do so that is the central question and will be for many years
another vote on saviour siblings tonight and a couple more tomorrow spraying crops with pressed pesticides plays a role in the mass production of affordable food but they could be a darker side to this technology research carried out at punjab university has revealed the use of pesticides could have caused genetic damage among rural communities in india sign to say it could be the reason for increased cancer rates from workers mixing up a cocktail of chemicals to kill pests has become a routine part of farming worldwide but here in punjab there are increasing concerns that the practice could be killing more than the pests that attack their we'd although the bottle although there are warnings that this is poisonous and users should wear protective clothing they just have thin clothing farmers all have stories of how they have been affected they believe by using the spray in this group a young man recently collapsed and was passing blood after using a spray
i am afraid a lot of people have died because of the spray
the fear of what they may be doing to themselves is a hard thing to admit the intensive agriculture practices the green revolution of the nineteen seventies has made this the richest farmland in india the worst part of it is that this technology has saved the lives of millions of people around the world by providing better cheaper food over the last three decades it has made punjab bridge but at a terrible price there has been suspicion for years about potential links between processed pesticide use and cancer new research among these farmworkers suggests why they may be affected
these images show normal d. n. a. undamaged then at the building blocks of life itself d. n. a. damaged with a long tail they call a it
we also considered other confounding factors age smoking alcohol intake and dietary habits all of them did not show any relation so from there we can say the damage was because of these pesticides only most probably so the cancer risk is greatly increased we found the incident of d. n. a. damage
this man and his wife are of a generation who has benefited most from the green revolution both are now suffering from cancer to keep the pests down they do need to spray night and day we have been using spray for twenty years and in the beginning we used smaller amounts but now we use more we have to use them round the clock in the growing growing season a report in the local paper asks if babies with a explained birth defects could be connected with the way the spray is used the problem is the best sides is not affecting the be pests there are even more pest the problem is getting worse in a society where people live close to the soil and to their animals the possibility the way they had been using pesticides as been damaging their health is a frightening one it is the whole of the food chain which could be affected it might mean a radical change to farming practices will be needed at just at the time the world needs reliable cheap safe sources of food here it is the first day of the annual chelsea flower show it is normally associated with gardening extravagance but this year it also tackles more pressing needs such as parking your big rubbish we been and finding somewhere for the children to play have we been wheelie bins the blooms are perfect the designs spectacular this is where the rich and famous come for garden ideas
of growing vegetables
on the chicken cooked and this is where you get the eggs from three thousand six hundred for a chicken cooked after the fashion for green room so we now have green walls there are also other double issues such as allowing children more opportunity to play outside however mixing kids and chelsea bland perfection is not easy are you nervous
a bit but that is what it is all about it is an incredibly stimulating space for them
hello welcome to the one show with christine bleakley and adrian chiles and two action men ray mears is here l. am not sure i have seen you a roof over your head before we have some urban bushes out there could you forage round if there could you find anything for us to eat

syringes that type of thing the no less macho dan snow is with us too he is a very sensitive soul he likes shakespeare you know speaking of shakespeare christine wherefore art thou christine walkden could it be the flying gardener has ridden like the wind here to get here from essex yes she has what a woman she looks the part the chelsea flower show begins tomorrow i was down there for a quick look round today i was checking things out before the queen had a little look round there enjoying the show coverage of the r. h. s. chelsea flower show follows us on b. b. c. one this evening a passion for gardening means british gardens are in good nick that in turn mean there's is more stuff in
it might indicate it was a special guard foreign a special child
yes we took measures that we hope people would have a conscience and they would think better
it is but what else can i do you know we need something for sophie and i want something that will stay there
i up is suppose someone somewhere
but the fight back has begun this cheshire home has possibly the best protected garden in britain it has
tastes have got a lot grander last year we spent a record four billion in the process as well as plants shrubs and trees we have been shelling out on all sorts of garden accessories water few feature garden furniture and statues take a look at this and all to make sure that our little pieces of britain are the envy of our neighbours but it can also make them a honey pot for criminals as
we would have lost quite a lot
quite a lot how much
well several thousand
how much cover they need the next thing is when they are buying products don't go for the cheapest check that bit in the policy which says how much it is covered for and make sure it is adequate if it is not move to another insurer
if you are putting the final finish finishing touches to your dream garden you are ready to enjoy the summer take make sure your horticultural heaven is safe from thieves but christine my garden is somewhere i want to relax and i don't want to feel like i am in a big brother set up that james bond has kitted out it is terrible isn't it
it is but these days people will nick thing and just sensible precaution graful paths having locks that work making sure that the plant isn't attractive to somebody that nicks it the spinier an nastier the better because it will rip the blighters hands off so things like u. k. kas have spiky and they bite like mad roses are good prickly plant some of the hollies gooseberry real spiney fanny nicking that in the dark fancy nicking that

i knew they loved animals but i can't believe the variety it is wonderful
and is
is this a problem polly has suffered from
and we were having a discussion about whether it is better to pluck or shave ears to stop this and you go for shaving
mainly male vets recommend plucking
moving on from a very common problem to something a bit more exotic betty thank you tell us about
harry your owl harry was hit by a car about two years ago when he was very young and he was very concussed and tru this he has never been able to fly through
it is common to have owls hit cars it is quite common they swoop low and a fast moving car is no match for them harry's encounter left him with a neurological disorder you can see the scar tissue on his beak he can't fly any longer but he can run very fast so he has to live in an aviary you will keep a watchful eye on him
all the time he is lovely
from something little to lovely something a bit on a larger scale jackie this is trouble a bit of problem with her back
that's right after the winter i brought her back in and she dips one side
and paul what can we do about this problem
providing you don't move the furniture it is perfect
we are going to be hitting the road all week on wednesday if you have a pet that needs an m. o. t. bring them down to northumbria university in newcastle it will be great angellica great work down there get your pets along on wednesday and friday ray you have been all over the place the jungles tundra what appealed to you about the australian outback
four stories that are unusual in their own right and we had the opportunity to tell them so we grabbed it with both hands and some amazing stories like the a little tiny scots man who found the technique possible to cross australia and return he was the first man do that and it is a remarkable story
tough that is for sure we have a brilliant clip here from ray mears ray mears goes walkabout
as the sun climbs the heat rises to forty degrees and the bag begins to work the leaves perspire and release their precious life giving moisture let us look at the bag and i am pleased with that the reservoir hasn'ten been big enough there is a lot more i can tap down off the branch this is my choice of technique for an emergency you could have twenty or thirty stashs away in a vehicle without any difficulty should the need arise all you have to do is put them on the branch and let the sun do the rest l. love those kind of stories what i want to know is how do you learn these things work you grew up in a bungalow in croydon
i had a passion for being outdoors and i wanted to stay out and you start to answer some of the questions and each you answer poses five more and you start down this road that keeps going that is entersing the bag not all plants can be used for that in all desert in australia they are lucky because the eucalyptus gives a lot of water
when i am dying of thirstly have no bag no tring or i will pick the wrong bush l. have to say it is lovely to meet you because i have been mistaken for you for years now people come up to me and say you are off the telly and i go yes they say how do you eat those bugs i have got ray mears signature l. go like this just sign myself mearss earlier on i didn't quite see it but now you are both together i really do and i am going to move out of the way if you move over there let people see camera three you could be my stunt double
he is older man the and his hair hasn't gone grey
older than me have you been mistaken for me every day there week we are celebrating great british export five members of the one show family have picked their favourites l. would have thought dan snow would go for something like a tank or jet fighter but oh know r. no he wants to show his delicate sensitive side the great big softy has chosen william shakespeare in writing about every life experience imaginable shakespeare was never short for a few words in fact he has given the rest of us a few more to play with he has haded round two thousand words to our language and you are quoting him every time you say things like more fool you or it is early day i am talking about the world's greatest ever playwright william shakespeare and he wasn't a bad poet either l. am pay ago visits to the shakespeare bir place trust in stratford paul edmonson is head of education and learning here when did his works start getting exported abroad
fiep find it engaging
he becomes part of the modern language of that country so for example to a german reader in his or her own language they are reading a modern shakespeare so they can their perception would be different to our own
do the visitors reflect his global appeal
every year
everywhere in the world people will be knowing shakespeare
he is number one would say but i am english
been out there his work has been out there for four hundred years and we are in dialogue with artists from abroad coming here an then we also every year take productions out all over the world
why do foreigners have this love of shakespeare there is so many wonderful dram ti
important as export as steam power or the telephone or the stamp
there is lot to be said for the telephone but it is like saying do we have hospitals or culture you want people to be healthy but you want them to be healthy this in spirit it should be a shame if we were able to communicate but didn't have much to say
shakespeare died in stratford on avon on twenty third april one thousand six hundred sixteen this is the final resting place of my greatest british export he died popular successful man but he would have been surprised his works are so celebrated centuries later i will tell you what in one thousand years time people are still going to be reading shakespeare and watching him trying to make sense of their own lives and the world round them you see i can see you reading shakespeare in the outback
spaibg sheer shakespeare cruel to be kind those phrases will stick with us forever
when ever we are thinking about human beings lust love fear shakespeare gives
company it brings a huge amount of people and but it is more than that it not just the money it is the fact for thousands of years to come people will be thinking and using shakespeare to make sense of the world and it brings intangible benefit to britain and it is one of the reasons english is the world language and british industry has done well
i need more drama please
is that to be or not to be
genius well done he thought he would outsmart you that was in croatian but we we are inspired by this book called to be or not to be innit which is shakespeare for the modern generation it is yoof speak yoof speak we have got a couple of drama students here who have done a quick twelve seconds for us
there was something minging in the state of denmark which was making uncool
to be or not to be init would like to see the rest of that thank do you pupils of valle academy for that performance thank you we want to know what you think is the
best british export it might be
what a gorgeous little beast
meanwhile stair spare thought
what a nightmare but i am here to help l. have come to meet mel at the zoo and we are going on to squirrel monkey island
i was about to say when you do the census doesn't that look like that one how do you sex them and number them
we have what is called a tran responder so a microchip that gets inserted under the skill skin that goes into bristol zoo's data base so we need to catch them up which is a bit tricky
a bit tricky a lumbering thirteen stone idiot like myself running after these little beauties this is going to be more difficult than we thought isn't it they are soagele this is hopeless so agile not every animal is microchiped and here as the penguin enclosure nigel is counting them by a different method and one that has been pioneered here at the zoo so with the peng penguins it is about the bands
yes we have been developing these silicon bands which we use on our penguins now originally we used these very rigid metal band which are difficult to see the numbers and they wear on the flippers the number is unique to each bird and we can look at
it would be tremendously difficult if we had to do the whole colony so what we do is call the whole thung one colony it seems logical because there is only one queen in there so that is how we do it
here we are in your office and we are completely surrounded by snails where do they come from
all of these come from french polynesia and we need to count them because they are tremendously rare they are these are ex ping oh tinge in the the wild they only occur on this table and another one in france
count into life stage the only way you can tell the adult from a sub adult it has a long lip the long winter've nens must fly we wait for the summer
i've got to say i think it's absolutely ridiculous
you've made yourself completely un investible
you've got a patent worldwide i assume no eh
i think there may be an opportunity for someone to invest in this
my name is gill kirtland and my name is claire sagar
so tingotang was born to provide unique and distinctive symbols for single people just as wearing a wedding ring can show you're in a partnership now you can wear a tingotang to reveal your single status there's a male symbol for the guys and this is the female version tingotang has been made into a range of jewellery and accessories for people to wear to suit their own single lifestyle
ultimately we want tingotang to become the recognised symbol for single people everywhere we do have samples here to show you
i'm wearing the female charm as a pendant but it can also be worn on a handbag or a laptop case anywhere you feel comfortable to wear that we do a smaller charm which is suitable for a mobile phone or to go on a bracelet and we also do a pin badge which looks great on your jeans
and for guys we have the keyring showing the male symbol and we also have cufflinks and a pin badge as well
west yorkshire based duo gill kirtland and claire sagar need one hundred thousand to market their tingotang single status accessories they're offering twenty per cent of the business in return the pair are adamant the range will catch on with anyone looking for love but deborah meaden isn't looking so sure
hello is it gill claire
this is the alternative to stamping single across your forehead
it's a much more stylish and subtle way of saying i'm single and happy to make new connections
well the media relations that we did to start definitely seems to be the route that we have to take to get brand awareness
that's words what i'm after is numbers so your initial burst produced a turnover of
so that doesn't excite me at all so give me some more numbers now that really make me interested
we've actually focused our efforts on giving the product away to people during sort of club nights to try and create brand awareness
you know what that sounds like we've focused our efforts on giving the product away
it was to create brand awareness and interest in the brand
i started off by saying i hate the idea and i could imagine other people wouldn't like the idea of wearing a big i'm single stamped across them
it's a less than promising start as the duo feel the full force of deborah meaden's displeasure and unfortunately it's about to get worse
no i don't think it's sad the idea comes about from personal experience i was standing in a wine bar with a group of four girlfriends of the group there i was the only single girl nearby were groups of guys and so on who were you know talking and looking over and we're looking over at them and one of the girls said to me it must be great when you're out people must come over and say nice to meet you and have a little chat for five minutes and i said you know it never ever happens they said why do you think it is and i said cos how do they know i'm single
losing a dragon this early is a disaster for a pitch will the pair fare any better with james caan
we want to get into national glossies and into the newspapers about the product telling people about the product and how do you do that we're taking on a p. r. agency to do that for us
and what would that p. r. agency charge you we could set them a budget we've set them a budget
we've given them a four month project and we'll pay them thirteen thousand to do that
and what do you think they're gonna achieve in that four months
hopefully some national exposure for us
gill and claire are battling on but their efforts are being undermined by the adverse reaction the dragons have had to their basic idea will theo paphitis see any potential in the business
two dragons out gill and claire's pitch is collapsing around them duncan bannatyne hasn't said a word so far now he's ready to break his silence
i think that the best place for you to start is by giving up this ridiculous idea
right it really is it's ludicrous to think you can make money it may be a bit of fun
but you know i mean the only people who'll wear them a lot of single people they don't want the world to know that they're sad and single they're single but as soon as you wear that as soon as you wear that you're a sad single person
you're wrong that's not what people feel they feel confident that's the feedback we've had
claire gill i don't think that this is gonna make any money and i think from an investment point of view to put one hundred thousand into this you're gonna have to sell i don't know how many but it kind of feels like millions and for that reason i mean i was going to say i'm not up for it but i'm out
four dragons out and all that lies between the duo and expulsion from the den is one multi millionaire sadly for them it's the one who could find no redeeming features in the product from the outset deborah meaden has one last bone to pick with the entrepreneurs
how much do you think your idea is worth what value have you put on your idea
well what we're asking for from the dragons we've put in a value of half a million and i know but we're looking at something
say that again out loud and tell me if that sounds a bit ludicrous
no it doesn't sound ludicrous to me
the investment's required for us to achieve our potential that's what we're saying yeah but your value of your business is absolutely crazy
so i'm afraid you can hear exactly where i'm going i'm out
claire and gill have been exposed to the full force of the dragons' scorn and leave without ever managing to convince them their basic idea is a good one
speechless i'm speechless tingotang gone along
i think a rubber stamp would have worked a rubber stamp on the forehead i dunno enough yeah
entrepreneurs hoping for investment in food or drinks based businesses always try to tempt the dragons with tasty titbits unfortunately only rarely do they succeed in whetting the multi millionaires' appetites father and son team john and daniel hemmings from anglesey wanted a ninety thousand investment in their mr. stripey a six syrup flavour invention designed to revolutionise the u. k.'s ice cream industry
you've heard of mr. whippy you've heard of mister softee i give you mr. stripey
at first the dragons lapped it up but before long the ice cream men's pitch went into meltdown
you're making thirteen hundred and you've sold twenty over what period did you sell the twenty
since october two thousand three oh my god that's terrible
john tried in vain to counter the criticisms
we're fired up with mr. stripey we know that mr. stripey sells
john i'm theo mr. stripey doesn't quite sell
duncan bannatyne who began his multi million pound empire with just one ice cream van was adamant the invention was behind the times
ice cream machines will not sell in the u. k. the way they did thirty years ago d'you know why because thirty years ago we didn't have supermarkets that sell ice cream the way they sell ice cream now
and finally deborah meaden with her own experience of the ice cream business drew a line under mr. stripey's time in the den
can i tell you i'm going to explode i had until about a month ago six ice cream parlours and i am not in the slightest bit interested in buying a mr. stripey from you so i'm afraid for that reason i'm out
thirty one year old londoner anthony clough has delivered an authoritative pitch for one hundred sixty five thousand of investment in his magnetic invention designed to make changing bulbs easier but he's offering just ten per cent of his fledgling company in return duncan bannatyne wants to know about the business forecasts for anthony's product
yes d'you know how many twelve and a half p.'s there are in that er yes
have you projected how many you'll sell for the first three years
two thousand ten the turnover up to seven five million
three point five million or so net profit
anthony's confidence in his invention seems unshakeable now peter jones wants to know how the young entrepreneur became involved in this sector in the first place
anthony tell me about you why did you come up with this idea
i was sitting when did you have this great light bulb moment right at the royal college of art in industrial design engineering in an ergonomics slash human factors module to come up with a product aiding a human integrating with their life i thought of people that couldn't change light bulbs due to mobility impairments etc then i realised it's suitable for everyone and there's a business market behind it too
well i've got some initial angel based funding which is taken me to this stage
how much do you have i have a secured loan of sixty thousand in the business and what did they get in equity share for that
was that i was straight out of college and could do nothing so they paid for the patent costs i was eager to do something with it straightaway
that's right yes
this is an organisation with money coming out of their ears and for some reason they do not want to fund you any further
they're not saying they won't put the money in why are you here then we're inviting you think if you can get away with an investment of one point five million
a ridiculous valuation for your company you know they're not mugs you probably work with them do you think we are no not at all
could i bring up my advocate please craig rochford
well if he's got the answer to that question by all means
i think he will bring him up
anthony has dropped a bombshell and it's left the dragons feeling decidedly uneasy under den rules entrepreneurs can summon advocates to help with specific areas of their pitch so can craig rochford anthony's business partner help restore the multi millionaires' faith in the invention
this is craig rochford
craig do you know the answer to why gresham who got shares for nothing why aren't they funding further development
they haven't said that when you approached them for money to go to the next level no we didn't ask for more money why we don't need more money yet
but why have you come to us
because of what you guys can offer i mean you know
but you're offering us a ridiculous valuation i would rather paint the eiffel tower for free than invest one hundred sixty five thousand of my money and get ten per cent of your company and that's why i'm out
anthony's been blasted by peter jones who's walked away from any further negotiations but duncan bannatyne seems to have something else on his mind
well often when you've got a family and a lot of children you're sitting on a sunday afternoon with your feet up in front of the fire reading the sunday newspaper and your children go out to play in the back garden and there's something about children that means they can never shut a door so they leave the back door open and half an hour later they come in there's something that makes them come in the front door so the front door's open and the back door's open and then for some reason i don't know if it's the wind there's always this bang one of the doors goes bang and shuts have you ever experienced that
yes it happens in the house all the time and i know when it happens
when that wind comes in and the door shuts and there's a bang that's what'll happen i'll have broken light bulbs all over the house in my children's bedrooms this thing is dangerous it really is so i don't wanna invest so i'm out
two dragons out and anthony's pitch is in trouble now james caan thinks he's spotted something his rival multi millionaires have missed
i can see exactly what duncan did and i can see why it fell and that's because the magnets are only at each end but if they were at four ends that would never have happened because when you do it this way it doesn't happen if you hold it this way it does fall so is there any reason why we couldn't have magnets in four spaces which would eliminate that problem
no not at all
right
u. p. i would have thought i should think i am just staggered i just think whilst the concept might have started as a good idea and as good concept for all the right reasons i just think you've now totally and utterly lost the plot and for those reasons you've lost me so i'm out right
anthony craig i've sat here and listened to and seen an awful lot of things that disturb me when you first came up i thought what a neat idea that's great the problem is you have given away forty per cent of your business that's the one statement you have a loan secured against your business
it gets that money back and still owns forty per cent of the business james is offering you a similar deal so that you will have given away sixty per cent of your business
yes and if i'm not careful one day i'll find you've given away ninety five per cent of the business
you couldn't care less whether or not you sold any light bulbs so you've made yourself completely un investible and i just urge you think very carefully what you do with your shares
anthony's chances of investment are hanging by a thread his only hope now is that james caan will see enough potential in his young business to back anthony with all the money he's asked for
well anthony craig i gave you a lifeline i gave you the opportunity to convince the other dragons i still think this is a good idea but unfortunately i think it's too early stage to give you all the money unfortunately regrettably
give him the money if you're that regrettably about it stop offering half
in essence what's your tag have a new alphabet codes we felt the best way to get that out into the market was to launch our very own fashion collection
each item comes with a different what's your tag code but theo paphitis couldn't decipher what barry was on about
i'd like to say i got it but i haven't managed to get what you're trying to sell me
we've got a funky fun interesting code we're trying to create some lifestyle some expression
duncan bannatyne had some questions of his own
come on what's the point in the code
because it's fun it's fun is it and it's different
and the writing was all too soon on the wall for barry
what's that don't you read the code i wrote exactly the same
serial inventor matthew white also wanted one hundred thousand to perfect his latest prototype a stylish hand dryer with a difference
my invention basically dries your hands and it uses infrared heat allowing more water to evaporate it's like bathing your hands in sunlight
deborah meaden was keen to road test the device
i mean the first thing you'll notice is how quiet it is so we can hold a normal conversation while it's on yeah
the second thing i notice is my hands aren't feeling terribly dry
your hands are very wet so it's taking a while
well when you wash your hands guess what
yes they get very wet
but peter jones thought there was a bigger problem with the invention
that's about the size of a tumble dryer um
a small sized tumble dryer maybe
and james caan thought the hand dryer was simply a lot of hot air
honestly if i were you i'd pack it in i think you're so early in your development phase i think you're wasting your time
can i my perspective matthew absolutely not really
i don't wanna hear any more i was gonna agree with you i'm glad you're gonna agree and for that reason matthew because you're gonna agree with me i'm out
so far tonight no one has left the den with an investment but will any of these intrepid entrepreneurs persuade the multi millionaires to back them with their own cash
you're in danger of mucking up this whole product because you're being greedy i think that the whole pitch was absolutely appalling
if something looks too good to be true it's generally too good to be true
i'm aileen holmes and i'm managing director head cook and bottle washer of the happy horse company the limpet saddle pad is the principle property that i market and saddle pads generally are made of wool sheepskins fleeces er felt and cotton all generate a friction and a discomfort to the horses that carry these pads it also has a concussion absorption that is quite huge limpet actually allows that concussion to be absorbed and the horse's backs to be safe the other advantage we have is the anti slip holds your saddle still we i've marketed it both here and in the united states and it was an amateur this is up till now it's been a hugely amateur game right now we're doing two a day if you like my belief is that we can increase that quite easily to twenty five a day thank you
a nervous aileen holmes has finally reached the end of her pitch for a ninety five thousand investment in her happy horse breathable limpet saddle pad it's devised to make horse riding safer and more comfortable for equestrian and mount but has her stumbling presentation alienated the dragons
what's the name of the horse
i'm going to call him charlie charlie and he was very naughty what i thought he was very good he didn't move at all well he could have dropped his head sir oh absolutely
he could have dropped something else and it wouldn't be good in the den right aileen just very briefly tell me about you and your journey before we go through figures which i'll come back to your journey in creating the limpet saddle pad
i actually breed show horses they're anglo arabians and hugely successful they're world class horses eighteen supreme champions
i'm not going to count it sir
i started marketing it in ninety four but it was terribly slow because
you bet it's terribly slow nineteen ninety four
yes but it was a hobby to be fair i don't do marketing i foal mares i don't do marketing you sound as if you do something successfully
and when one person does something successfully they've normally got an eye for what is successful and what isn't and marketing a product since nineteen ninety four and selling two a day
that's right is not successful
theo paphitis might not be able to fault the horsewoman's experience but he's sceptical about her poor sales figures will deborah meaden an experienced rider be more enthusiastic about the saddle pad
hello ali hello hi i'm deborah can you explain to me what you've got that is unique have you got any kind of protection on that
the protection basically is that it's been out in the market and we are the leader in this particular field
but in theory legally you have absolutely no protection on that at all
it's possible the next thing is what do equine vets say about it here in the u. k. when we first brought it out peter scott who was the olympic veterinary surgeon he approved it but of course he's not allowed to endorse any particular product so we took it to the states and invited the leading back veterinary surgeon there to test it and evaluate it and he considers it is the finest product available to him for back issues
you've been over to the states you're very good at marketing you've sold seven hundred you're selling two a day how big's this market
come on i'm sorry the whole world you must advertise in some of these publications for your horses no ma'am i don't you've sorted out going to a vet in america to say this is a great product but you have not picked the phone up in horse and hound no i haven't
deborah meaden seems unconvinced and the interrogation has made duncan bannatyne curious about aileen's plans for the investment
so what are you going to do with the ninety five thousand if you raise it today
this is something i haven't been able to do i would be able to have a greater inventory to allow me to meet demand at the moment the cost
right now probably five thousand worth
and how many's that what price do they sell at
the average price is thirty five thirty six that's an average from the little to the big one but a minimum order is going to cost me twenty thousand and that has always been my problem i haven't enough money to generate enough stock to allow me to advertise it's been a vicious circle
how much is an advert in house and hound
about four hundred for a quarter page once it it doesn't work you've tried it once in nineteen ninety five or six yes this is like
this is kind of unfolding you've never advertised in horse and hound now you've advertised and it didn't work well i consider it as never we tried it once it was an absolute disaster
nothing happened and what i was saying to you was that the collective consciousness of the equine industry
why are you going into the states
because i believe that the market is there
because you've saturated the u. k. market at two sales a day and you're now looking for a new market
i don't believe we've saturated it no not by a long shot
but why wouldn't you believe that when your sales have stayed static
i think they've quietly grown here but with no advertising
really quietly haven't they yes
aileen's contradicting herself and the dragons are losing confidence james caan has heard enough
ali hi i'm james hi james i think ali you know exactly what you're doing i think you're very competent in marketing sales advertising i think you know exactly what you're doing i think your product has kind of hit its marketplace and i think you're there i don't think taking money from us is going to make any difference at all i don't buy into your stock argument so i think this would be just good money after bad and on that basis i'm out thank you
well you've got this stock you can't sell it you've done advertising it doesn't work you know really anybody who tells you that you can do better is not being kind to you so i'll be kind and tell you i'm not interested and i'm out thank you
duncan bannatyne and james caan have pulled out of any deal will equestrian deborah meaden disagree with her rivals
it doesn't hang together your story you are good at marketing you've worked damn hard at this and i think it has been more than just a part time job to you because you tell us the things that you've done and you've done the right things the problem is you're selling two saddle pads a day and i just don't think that there's a massive market out there so i'm afraid on a business level it's just of no interest to me so i'm out fine thank you
i've got two eleven year olds annabelle and holly and they ride and when we go to the tack shop i've lost count how many pads there is there of different makes the market is seriously overcrowded that's right i don't think it's investible your product has reached its finite limit so i'm afraid for those reasons i too am out thank you
aileen's pitch is falling apart she's lost four dragons in as many minutes peter jones is now the only dragon still to declare his position
aileen i've just been sitting here i've not said anything cos i'm just i'm absolutely i feel like i'm about to get on my high horse because i think that the whole pitch was absolutely appalling and i can't believe that we've sat here for the last god knows how long talking about a rubber pad for a horse
it's a shame sir that you've missed the very point it is because it is not rubber and it is not closed cell and because it is open cell it breathes it sticks makes it unique
you've proved the product doesn't sell you're uninvestible so i'm out thank you goodbye bye bye
the dragons couldn't doubt aileen's equestrian credentials but in the end they just didn't think they'd make any money from her happy horse business every entrepreneur who comes to the den thinks their idea has the potential to make them millions sadly very few manage to persuade the dragons likewise like businessmen john barstead and mark tracey who wanted a one hundred fifty thousand investment in their portable children's swimming pool alarm
dolphin alarms have developed a swimming pool alarm system to help prevent accidental drowning of children in swimming pools and ponds it consists of two components a receiver which stays in the pool all the time and a transmitter you strap to the child
the dragons could see potential in the product but duncan bannatyne thought he's spotted an obvious flaw
my child wouldn't wear that
would they wear a wristband or an armband or a chestband
theo paphitis blasted the duo on their pricing strategy
the cost was how much twenty one and you sell to the retailers at sixty six wow you're in danger of mucking up this whole product because you're being greedy
in the end it was left to james caan to bring the entrepreneurs' time in the den to a speedy end
can i just tell you guys i think the alarm has gone off for me i'm out
thank you very much
the seraphina works in two ways firstly it helps pull the tummy muscles back in and secondly it's also helping to support the back
peter jones couldn't wait to try the belt out for size
i'm getting a bit hot and flustered here
but the hilarity didn't last long for duncan bannatyne
i quite believe that everybody loves it but the trouble is none of these people are buying it
we're pretty early days here i'm not saying i've been trying to sell this for three years
deborah has spoken to everybody in the world about it she hasn't no i've spoken to ladies
for lingerie magnate theo paphitis the seraphina was old news
you won't be surprised to know i've seen it many times before and the reason you haven't seen them survive in the u. k. is because they haven't sold
ultimately the duo failed to squeeze any investment out of the multi millionaires
it's not something i can invest in to make money out of i can't see where it'll come from i call a lifestyle business and i say to you good luck but i'm out thank you very much cheers first time i've ever put on a girdle
serial entrepreneur peter moule is asking the dragons for a one hundred fifty thousand investment in his company electro expo in return for a ten per cent stake but with the company already doing so well duncan bannatyne has a key question for the businessman
thank you peter as you give me your pitch and you told me that this was selling a million per year that's correct in excess and you're making three hundred thousand per annum profit yep what's going through my mind was why did you need any investor
the reason being is that i'm selling it to the trade market i'd like to take it to the domestic and retail market to europe and to the united states i've no expertise in the retail market i've no expertise in export i need to gear it up for the domestic marketplace if you realise there's thirty five million households in england every single household could do with one of these
peter why is it a domestic market situation most people who live in houses have their wiring done by someone else
duncan bannatyne is deeply dubious about any potential for the chocbox in the domestic market will theo paphitis agree with his rival
peter hi i'm theo i've just got to come in here cos duncan is absolutely right to actually do any form of wiring in a house now you have to be a qualified electrician so domestic people are not going to mess around with their electrics
that's just one part of what i want to move into the big part is going into europe and the united states
you've got a patent worldwide i assume no eh it's not worldwide what is it for then england but you want to go into the states i do so you've not protected that not as yet are you still within time i'm not sure
the dragons are stunned that peter has broken one of the most basic rules of business by failing to protect his idea from copycat rivals and james caan isn't prepared to let the matter lie
i'm just staggered why wouldn't it have dawned on you to register it in a much wider territory
it's not my only company if it was i would have spent all of my time on this and perhaps would have done what i should have i'm now at a stage where this can absolutely go fantastic
what's the other company
it's an electrical company that does electrical work in museums and exhibitions
and how successful is that company
as successful as this company
does it makes three hundred thousand a year as well yes
peter's clearly not lacking profits what he claims to lack is the expertise to take his business global it's a highly unusual situation in the den and it's unsettling some of the dragons
thank you peter i'm peter hello
i'm not gonna give you such a hard time over it on the basis that i actually like the product i think you're at the maximum rate of the application that's the reason i'm out
two dragons out and peter's pitch is suddenly looking shaky will james caan be prepared to give the entrepreneur a second chance
give me your numbers over the last three years what's the turnover and profitability been
what does it cost you for the product what do you sell it for
the margin i actually pay is one hundred twenty eight pence delivered and i sell it between thirty eight pence and sixty five pence
if i make you an offer peter what would my exit be
how about if i offered a clause where i would guarantee to buy back your shares at any particular time so you're not risking any of your money at all
at what price
it's a den first peter is so determined to secure the dragons' business expertise he's offering them a money back guarantee on any investment in him duncan bannatyne is ready to show his hand
duncan bannatyne is keen to clinch this deal will deborah meaden who's remained silent up until now follow suit
i'm not actually asking the dragons to risk any money
but d'you know this is this is oddly we've got that we've done our numbers we understand that but you know i just have a saying if something looks too good to be true it's generally too good to be true peter i need to tell you where i am i'm here to make real solid investments and at the end of it i get reward you have not convinced me so i'm afraid i should be snapping your hand off but i think i'd be completely wasting my time and i'm not into that so for that reason i'm out
an angry deborah meaden has walked away from any deal now james caan is ready to have his say
peter has divided the den but has secured an offer for the full amount from duncan bannatyne and james caan it means sacrificing forty five per cent of his very profitable company though and as eager as peter may be to win the dragons' backing he's not prepared to give in without a negotiation
could we negotiate for fifteen per cent equity each
i'll tell you what i'm prepared to do i've been taught in business that when you're in that sort of situation the best thing always to do is to meet halfway yep we're saying two hundred twenty five you're saying fifteen that kind of feels like eighteen per cent each to me
i'd be more than happy to go with both of you but all i'd like you to do is if you could both come down to fifteen i'll walk over there now and do it
we'll come in at eighteen each but we can put a ratchet system where you can get your three per cent back from each of us to reduce it to fifteen each
what's the ratchet system
you make one million in the third year and we'll each give you back three per cent of the shareholding
do we have ourselves a deal then certainly on those figures well let's shake hands peter on that note congratulations
but more importantly for him two dragons to help take his business to worldwide success peter i'm totally perplexed why have you given away so much of your company a money back guarantee and the business is flourishing it's making hundreds of thousands
because we're going to be making millions with the dragons' help
i think you must be the first person to face the dragons who's gone in undervaluing their company rather than overvaluing it
well all i'd say is that it's better to have seventy per cent of a lot than one hundred per cent of a lot less so i'm very happy
well you've got two dragons you're paying a lot for them all the best
thank you very much
the dragons tell entrepreneurs if they want investment and help with the business they're better offer a good deal in the den well peter moule took them at their word and made an offer they couldn't refuse you can find out more about the dragons and the entrepreneurs on the website goodbye next time on dragon's den peter jones is bemused by one entrepreneur
you come across as quite a sensible guy and yet you've invented the most ridiculous product i've ever seen
and we find out how some of our newest entrepreneurs have got on since they left the den
we've taken as many orders in the last five days as sarah lou took in the first three months of trading
i think i'm working hard but i enjoy it
rain many times this year the weather still managed to play havoc but in a different way
the problem we have had to overcome is the heat that has slowed things down it has been very hot
the plants almost wilt and we are getting sun burn
so lou did they keep their teams going
try a whip
we are five days behind l. seem to be the last person to plant the garden this year thinking ahead the contractors have got some proper lights and we can do it under floot lights
with hours to go last night the show ground was all lit up for some there was reason to celebrate when the work was complete for others it was a different story
this is a panic it is getting dark and we are still here so a bit of a stressy time
we have to go and get the last things the strawberries are covered and otherwise the black bird will have supper
we are finished and are just tidying up but we like to be tidy for press day
we have been here since dawn day and it is now what is it ten to we are not finished well we are finished but it is trying to make everything perfect
by burnham nurseries this is the cutting edge of horticultural aucouture this is the first garden he has designed and built not only is he competing with the best he is doing something he never practised before
but they are looking for medals they are not competing against each other they are only competing against their brief and the highest accolade is best in show
what are the overview this year then joe what are the gardeners telling us about the way garden design is progressing and going on
the season's designers who have gold stacked up behind it are simpifying it more and more there is lots of green we know that some of the other designers are trying to cram as much as possible into the garden features and water and lots of different colours and overcomplicating you are getting a split in a way
you are getting crowd pleasers on the one hand and people who are saying i am pioneer because this is where i think it is going and they are risking the judges saying it is not enough
the thought process behind this is just fascinating
and my sweat lawn
he was really really keen and over the years it became more important
we go from the liverpool street in which he was brought up to this amazingly psyche dillic pathway
how did his garden taste develop
he began by clearing he always said if he mowed the the lawn when he moved in it was really derelict get the lawn ready and start taking things out and many years went by before he started putting colour in the garden
howled
was he how old was he he he was twenty seven
but then we come through to what you might call the spiritual part of his life
that's right
up here which is very i can see him meditating yvonne you put this together with livia what were you trying to show you had lot to choose from we felt we needed to show george the gardener as opposed to the all rounded george the only way to do it was a narrative way of showing his boyhood each part is brief this is the biggest part this is the eternal part and you know it is easy and quick zblu put together you put together garden which is a change
from the green you have given us
good deal of colour will it be going anywhere afterwards
i think it will be going home afterwards
this will make it to friar park
and turned it into something which
how did the garden fit in with the
glitteraty my glamorous ladies here today thank you very much are you enjoying it so far
loving it l. haven't been here that long but loving what i have seen so far chelsea is our special day
do you come every year
every year i come every year i can
i have not been here many years when he was asked to come i did
it is bigger and better i'm lucky to have garden like
lot of people but it gives you a lot of ideas and shows you what can be done there is a lot of interest in making little space where you can have tranquillity
recycling is bigger and better at chelsea there are so many great ideas and i'm in the children's society garden and they have a fantastic idea over there for hiding your wheelie bins
you can see the trend for this year which is ava from any away from any informality and a lot of green
ifs formal and largy green quite a void of colour
it is green
green seems to be the colour
most of them are green astron my astron mey is close to my heart got my p. h. d. but looking at this i may have go
will we
if you not really that clever at putting plants together it is inspirational if you are a brilliant gardener you see amazing spokesmans it is something for everyone
i have never been to chelsea before i'm gobsmacked i didn't know what was going on the huge sort of arena of gardening
vine weel
it is revealing the complexity of the process it frightens me to think i may come back and face the wrath of
hard hard work i'm pretty nervous
the standard is exceptionally high the problem is that if all the gardens are that much better does it raise the bar and mean that the gardens have to try harder to get a gold medal
there is some nerves
there will be some who don't like it l. hope that the garden might please people in different ways there is a lot of colour at the front and it is green and calm and at and back
so you
that is as much as the judges have ever revealed
with the judging over revealed the designers have a long night ahead to wait for the results
they are beautiful they aren't cutting edge but they are things people love they are designed by sale landscapes and it is meant to point up the biodiversity in english ruins like these old things that are falling down they wonderful places for bits of nature you have gone far north
would have been great
it is important particularly in primary schools to show children where the plants come from and where their food comes from and get them interested in nature and growing things then they become more aware and have a greater feeling for the countryside
the queen victor queen of the realm which win will you go for
but griffin continued testing the bats' ability to avoid fine wires in the flight cages at harvard by nineteen sixty it was clear that echolocation provided the bats with a detailed sense of their world helped to explore that world using high speed tape recorders to slow down calls showed different species used sound differently to suit their habitat
as soon as we turned on the set the bat just took off from its perch made a beeline to the speaker it was obvious that this bat thought there was a frog inside that box
one of the challenges is trying to work out how the nervous systems of these animals cope in terms of time we know from laboratory studies that bats can make discriminations in the order of ten nanoseconds a nanosecond is a billionth of a second in terms of distance this corresponds to a difference in range in the order of two micrometres some scientists argue that animals just cannot make these sorts of discriminations given what we know about their nervous systems so the challenge is trying to work out how bats do it
get into a jawing match with her is just gonna make things worse

look it's all right i can manage
she was just practising her pole dancing it's a new way of getting fit the stable boy hasn't told her the horse has bolted then she's trying yeah trying to get in your undercrackers i warned you is it wrong to want a happy ending
you can have a happy ending in the divorce court but the longer you leave it
i know can we change the subject how was benidorm dunno
spent it holed up in the hotel with a spanish bug
so you got a result then oh no your holiday romances are always doomed
all right maybe glynis'll be the exception to that
glynis yeah a trolley dolly we met on the flight home
our eyes met over the in flight safety demonstration check out the flotation devices on that ooh my word yeah
look i have just
the course of true love always does run rough she won't talk to me
consider yourself lucky mate
the mute stance is standard in a strop you just gotta let her get through the sulking stage and get through the other side get into a jawing match with her is just gonna make things worse
what so i can't even apologise
you tried that this morning you doughnut look where that got you you gotta accept it women are better at the talking lark right
yeah
you say your piece and then they throw a question at you before you know it you've given an answer and it's the wrong one
yeah even if it's the right one
it's not for nothing they prefer a strong silent type so if you don't open your mouth you can't put your foot in it my advice to you keep it shtoom
oh sorry lauren's school disco next week i swear she's practising her moves when no one's watching
what happened to this batteries
can you believe i was lecturing dot on basic survival as a singleton never could take my own advice
you coping
yeah course i am what about you how's life after ronnie
well she's been down to the club a few times check takings make sure her investment's safe
that's not what i meant well all that's in the past
the only thing between me and ronnie now's a balance sheet she ain't gonna be pleased i'm short of a d. j. tonight it's this bassline club night i've been trying to find somebody else but it's now nine hours and counting how about roxy isn't she into all that
i'm sure she'd do you a favour if you asked nicely her and ronnie aren't joined at the hip are they like you said it's strictly business what's stopping you
nothing i guess
sorry he's still teething
i gotta go anyway thanks for the coffee
any time jack thanks for popping by
so how did you get on
you said you'd talk to chelsea about tomorrow
she said she doesn't wanna do anything
what i've gotta go
no it's fine bianca i'll give liam a lesson tomorrow you can pay me at the end of the week all right you too bye
you're giving paid lessons to liam butcher
if i am it has nothing to do with you
well maybe it has for your information i happen to be giving lessons to lauren branning if you intend to expand your horizons i'd like to make it perfectly clear that i'll strongly resist any attempts to poach my students are you even listening libby
any minute any minute now yeah
you seen the film invasion of the body snatchers
yeah where the aliens take over people's bodies
yeah they look the same but they're not
so minty he didn't succumb to your dita von teese routine
we got interrupted by garry i won't even get a look in now he's back i don't get it shirl
that's your problem
no i mean i love minty to bits but he'll only ever see me as a mate whereas you you've got it on tap with vinnie when he's never exactly been your mr. right
i never let him
well now you're trying maybe you'll feel something in time
i already am face ache
look she's doing it again think the nick could've done something to her i dunno ask heather for me
all right darling white wine when you're ready shirl roxy about yeah lounging about upstairs lazy mare's been there all day
is there anything else i can do call darren no
no no maybe you could answer a question for me it's just you don't have a girlfriend so i was i was wondering if you ever relax with certain reading material in your spare time if you know what i mean of course
i'm currently reading moby dick and english isn't even one of my subjects
uh huh i was i was thinking more all blokes read magazines like this don't they
not this one
freezing me out
hey
when were you gonna tell me in the next nine months i hope
i wasn't in the mood for another lecture all right you didn't exactly hold back last week
oh dear said all the wrong things did i maybe you won't invite me to the baby shower so what happened after i left ronnie tell you you made a mistake and she'd put everything right
it's more complicated
maybe you're right one for the girls is it rox
i can't get rid of the baby
don't mean you can do it though does it
like what well i'm guessing you haven't told ronnie who the father is i don't know who the father is
you know you've got two choices your sister's ex or the local nutter and it won't be long before one of 'em has a clue no
no i can manage this ronnie's gonna help me help you bring up jack's kid i already told you it might not be his
you don't know you won't be able to do this sooner or later the lies will catch up with you roxy i'm only thinking of you
and that i won't be around to party maybe this has made me realise there is more to life than waking up every morning with a hangover
or jack branning or sean slater come on you'll never be able to handle living here knowing one of those guys is the father
watch me
someone's let me down and i need you to d. j. at the club if you can do it i'll make it worth your while one hundred quid for three hours cash
make it one hundred fifty and you're on
done
i want you to know how sorry i am for all the things that i've said to you
i'm sure you didn't bring me all this way for an apology why don't you tell me the real reason
you are the head of the family and while masood's away i've been left to run the business on my own
you've probably done a better job of it than my brother the flat footed postman
please don't make fun of him
but i've done it all my life and with good cause when it comes to business your husband makes a very fine postman
that's not fair masood had his own company
and a chance to make something of himself but we both know what he did with it he can't even provide properly for his own family
he does his best but is it good enough
face it the man's a failure
whereas you are a great success a wealthy man blessed with fortune
which is why you're about to ask me for money
i was thinking oh yeah yeah i've got tonight off so if it's all right with you
when've you ever asked if anything's all right with me i'm asking you now what wanna go out for a drink with heather or something no
i wanna stay in cook you a meal do ya
amazing i didn't think she could do it but i ain't seen her jump down his throat once
that's what this is about she's trying to be nice
yeah to vinnie see she knows they might not be well you know the perfect couple but she's really trying to make things work because he loves her ever so much i'd better go
so you up for a few bevvies later celebrate the hobster's return
i don't know if i want to go out what else you gonna do watch heather pole dance
actually it was quite funny after the initial shock best tell her though eh
look heather can do what she wants and i'll support her if she wants to pole dance i might even put up a proper pole
don't attach it to the ceiling mine's a pint
we should make an effort you should listen to what chelsea wants
it's her birthday not yours
i know chelsea man she'd expect me to arrange something you wait the usual for me
trying to be nice shirley
that's what heather said there's a favour you could do for me oh yeah
it would just be a loan a simple business transaction
in my experience business is rarely simple
it wouldn't be for long i have many ideas of how to turn the business round i can write them all down for you if you want make a proper plan i know a man with your business acumen would really appreciate that
of course it's all in the detail isn't it something masood never really could appreciate the way the small efforts always pay off come on are you really as desperate as you'd have me believe or perhaps just a little lonely
for you the great inzamam the pillar of our community if people only knew what you were really but they don't
and you won't be telling anyone or i might just have to make a disclosure of my own would you really be happy with everyone knowing about you zainab including your lovely daughter and your dutiful son
libby can we just talk
how's my little domestic goddess today then what's cooking
i'm doing a roast you couldn't lay the table for me could you

what i need i mean what i want is i want it to be
the real thing yeah some divvy model with an outsize chest
no the real thing with you vinnie was right what what what i mean is that we have been together for a year and in that year it feels like we ain't moved on much not that that's a problem i just feel like if there was anyone or anything in the way then you could tell me
why not get yourself an inflatable girlfriend
oh come on libby
it's a fondue a traditional swiss recipe would be gruyere and emmenthal you see
but this one has ten different varieties jarlsberg leerdammer stilton roquefort edam brie and one of your favourites which is
stinking bishop
all right well
i bought us a bunch of healthy stuff i thought i'd do us some dinner tonight
try this you're pregnant like i said i'm gonna work and save for this baby why not throw in some pole dancing
you don't need to wrap me in cotton wool i know what i'm doing i can take care of myself
that is how you got pregnant in the first place roxy
mum listen i was just going to cook dinner what's wrong

great yeah can we do it after eurovision's finished i know i could record it but it's not the same
like watching the cup final the day after
i haven't missed one since nineteen eighty eight it's like karaoke for the world
it's probably why we don't win it too much competition if they let george sing for us we'd win it every time
er can i tell you a secret
what's that
i'm an abba fan but don't tell garry
are you yeah how did you know these were my favourite cheeses

can i make a request scotch please mate large one
oh thanks love gonna have one yourself
no not tonight
good girl cutting out the booze eh
no i'm just cutting down that's all
that's it moderation in all things i've noticed the change in you already and i must say it's definitely one for the better i mean the loss of inhibitions is a very unattractive thing especially with a woman your age just goes to show you you're never too old to change so what time's my dinner
it's ready now
well that's more like it
libby tells me you're not doing anything at all tomorrow
yeah that's right how about we celebrate with a nice family lunch family yeah you libby me yo

yeah i quite liked chiquitita
for me it was agnetha
eh
you know the blonde one with the
yeah i remember who she was
ah didn't matter what she wore you know whether it was silk or velvet that bum of hers was a force of nature it was like two boiled eggs under a hankie as opposed to two little boys fighting under a blanket i'm sorry i didn't mean
i'd better go and do the washing up
no wait
it's been a really lovely evening george eurovision all my favourite cheeses what more could a girl want
bulbs bursting blockbuster blooms it is the premier of the world's most epic gardening event and we have been rubbing shoulders with the in crowd the inspirational r. h. s. chelsea flower show welcome back to the eighty sixth r. h. s. chelsea flower show sponse sponsored by marshalls to bring you extended coverage from the grounds of the royal hospital in london
it is a day of reckoning for chelsea's floral exhibitors and garden designers their fate lies in the hands of the judges who are are as we speak deliberating over hol get the med medals and what colour they will be
really good geometry but an informal movement through the space which i really like it is called the reflective garden there is lots and lots of green this fantastic plant a wonderingful architectural foliage and white slash green flowers on the top beautiful underneath we have the canopy of tree trees which have been pruned to give a nice shady cover worthwhile a beautiful seating area underneath
if you are not impressed with green guard nsz and you gardens and you want a bit of colour threfor foot and mouth d. trevor foot and mouth is the man for you tref or toot is the man for you
in the the world high fashion it is the like of carol who dictate trends this garden is designed with snaking paths
important particularly on this garden a huge sheet of water just broken up by that lazy s. of water lilies and a lump of rock
it is gorgeous and this is the cancer research garden and tears of water but not flowing between the two there is bubbly effects coming up from deep down and just breaking the surface of the water
they all like this dark effect they have large tanks surrounded by a curb of box l. remember robert myers doing that last year
this is tom stuart smith's this time he has gone for zinc and the reflective quality brings a beautiful quality to the garden
there is no doubting from sound and sight that water is the foundation of this garden
yeah it is they had lots of inspiration in terms of where the idea evolved from it has to be a garden in its own right and water gives an animated environment it is a garden about sensation the noise of the fountain water ripling down stone surfaces you have other areas where the water is calm and cool lots of ideas coming together but they have got to make an experience now not about the past not about the inspiration
it is a very con sempry garden contemporary garden the way you instil ideas and come up with the final plan
it would have been easy to make a garden about venice and imitate the past i try and take the essence of the past and distil it into a new form the timbers
yeah the timbers i was thinking about those they are outside the garden what do they represent
this as a creation that you could live with
even with this marquee at the back it doesn't look out of place it is a twentieth century piece of classical actech ture but it could be set in a courtyard context
when you get down here to the front it is calmer thank you very much indeed
thank you
show gardens like paul's may capture the headlines but but it is the great pavilion that truly captures the heart this is where it is all hang this is where it is all at the in the flower pavilion here you find plants that come from all over the world there are masses there are thousands of of different species hundreds and hundreds of newspaper plants things you have never seen before and you can find out how they grow and what they love to grow with and with lit lit bit of luck you will get ideas for your own garden you will not know where to start and i don't know now where better to start than with avon bulbs stand they always have this huge sort of pyramid full of so many goodies you you just want everything this fabulous orlaya the petals are a guide for insects to zoom in and find the pollen up there this changes its colour all the time pretty dainty delicate and easy to grow from seed almost as far from home as we could be this is a vast array of fascinating plants that typify south africa with every conceivable colour shape and form look at these wonderful plants they look like grasses but each one is different different form different sort of texture look at this one it has lovely drooping fronds most are from the cape and they go grow in marshy ground lupins are cottage garden type but hen you see them together like this in these splendid big patches they are dramatic a new introduction is lupin thunder the thing i love about them is the huge condensed spikes you can see them around the garden and they make wonderful focal points here there is a lot of glorious plants everything is intriguing dahlias you have hardly ever seen something like the big garden hybrids look at this great form it gives meaning and folkal point to is this is the chinese foxglove with the long flowers they are easy to grow from seed too look at that it is a sort of thistle it looks as though somebody had been at it with the scissors and chopped off the top how about this this is one of my favourite plants it loves to grow in damp shady places and reginald farer described it as that noble fairy from hardys to harveys and the double version of this flower it is a more compact plant and more ornate and it would would look better in formal setting it requires the same kind of conditions so too does this this is caramel you can see why it is called that they are sometimes called jester's hats these are a few examples of the huge number of plants you will find gathered together under one roof in the floral pavilion
chelsea is a world show case of the best in design it is here that you will find competitors from around the world the commonwealth is well respect e. represented including the carr bean caribbean this year j. may can have the backing of the country's prime minister wesley kerr reports
a magnificent seven the ladies of jamaica horticulture society and they are meeting with the prime minister bruce golding
people's view of themselves
it is very important jamaica is from the arabic world that means wood and waefrt water it is good to see that interest is being taken to elevate many of these natural plants and gie them the display and exposure that they deserve
what do you think of the efforts of the team at chelsea
they have the full support of my government in blazing the trail for jamaica in this additional arena
they were were so beautiful they looked almost unreal it is the fact they flower for so long in a day or two a rose is gone we have plants that can flower for months at a time
wild orchids jer nate on forest fun guy furn guy fungi you have plastered the art of microprop gaiion
the seed s. seedlelings are ready for being moved they have been insulated in this microclimate and now they are coming out into the world
yes this are coming from the womb where they have all the food and warmth and what ever they need they are coming into this wild wondrous world full of pests and disease
most orchids absorb their food from the air and are transferred to pieces of bark
this is what you end up with
i don't think so i'm not a patient person you do what you have to do and when
one that i have never seen hairy flower where is that from
that is from in saint james
do you get people from all over the islands sending you flowers
we go and select from the growers to make sure that we get the best quality
you ladies they must dread you coming you say i want that and that
before we go to make sure they there are no insects telling them make sure there is nothing on it that will cause us the gold it
is a superb sight what does it mean to you why are you here
well first we are here because we love dealing with flowers for jamaica it helps to sell jamaica as a destination over the years i have spoken to people who have skom to visit and hearing about jamaica they have no idea that we have such
it is beautiful
you know the story of the crown imperial it was the only flower which didn't bow its head in respect when christ died an angel came down and admonished it and then it did bow its head if you look in each flower there is a tear drop in each flower
you learn something every day
stick around
aged one hundred nine and the last surviving soldier who fought tpwh the trenchs in the first world war he was last man there and he is in the leeds city council garden that is a rest garden for soldiers
with the queen's horses
there was a horse here that we met we met a horse this is the tallest shetland pony there is at forty two inches each year he races in the shetland po pony grand national and each year he does not win
you were at the wrong end of him earlier stkpwhri wanted some mannure but i didn't get any
there is more to come but it includes the chelsea plants with an an tight for victory city slickers the urban gardens on the fast track to success and chelsea by royal appointment well if hunger for success can guarantee a chelsea medal then south west plants have the appetite for gold alistair pierce hopes to snap victory from the jaws of his exhibits there are very collecting these plants twenty six
the nice thing about breeding
plant is an opportunity to give it a name and to immortalise someone or something in its name this one i've named asbo it is about three foot all and has a great big mouth it is a really wicked in your face sort of plant i have i have another plant which i named after my mother in law she is actually chuffed she hasn't actual lip seen the plant she likes to think of it as one of the tall slender ones it's fairly plump it has red veins and gets redder and redder the more sun it gets
dominating the the purples and the grey slate
we are bang on the money i think it is a two way street fashion inspires gardening gardening inspires fashion
the the thing you can do is mix and match you can have a home or town garden or you can be in the country that you want in a corner
i know what it is like to be a towny and to to to yearn for the english country garden
i have heard that you are hoping to do a garden like this at chelsea next year
indeed me and mrs. llewelyn bowen i am not a great plant person
any tips
don't do it yes you will never sleep again
do do it it is worth it
i'm looking forward to it
i will have little snooze now
the national association of flower arrangement societies they use all this material and more they are in their fiftieth year well they bring together flower arranging clubs from across the country and each year one region takes its turn to represent them this year the challenge has gone to kent kent is the garden of england and we really want to show what kent can do my first job as team leader was to find a location where we could build our exhibit and work on it for months really when you think of all these other things that are going on the industrial industrial estate here and nobody is aware what beautiful flowers and what an amazing design is going on
with wanting to show beautiful coloured flowers to represent the shapes you would see in a kaleidoscope we want want people to feel the magic as they felt as child looking through our circles and seeing blocks of colour repeating and taking them on a a really magicical journey
before have we
we hate it don't
i'm doing the catering for the team it is important to make sure that everybody is fed and not hungry or i don't want them to flake out
although we have sur sur mourchted a a few challenges there are a few to go the biggest challenge is getting the flowers to the top ring i'm not planning on going up i think we're sending helen up there because she is the smallest and she is married to a builder and probably knows more about climbing
height doesn't really bother me as long as it feels stable and it is not wobbly it is fine what could could go wrong anything
i have never done anything as large as an exhibit like this and nor have my team but it is great plif privilege and we are really really keen to get a gold medal
i'm nervous and excited all the motions altogether
it is an amazing feeling designing for chelsea it is the very top you can get as a flower arranger
there is lot of pressure but we're not feeling it at the moment there is lot of pressure
you're being totally truthful
there i bet they are feeling the pressure has it got hotter
yes but it has been yaet great good fun but we are tired now
thank you for getting outfits that match my tie where did you go for these they do every size at this shop
did you get up the ladder
yes i had to be pushed up but the view from the top was a bird's eye view
you get the view we don't get except with our big jib arm
yes it is a lovely view but it is scary once you got used to everything moving and feeling sea sick it was fine
people don't realise the quantity of material that goes into these you can't do the entire thing beforehand because it costs too much
goodness me that is a long time you were here fifteen years ago
not me
but kent were
we would like to think we would what do you
think i
medal winning exhibit
now if you a digital viewer you can see more of the great pavilion by pressing red you can have a tour with carol klein and hear from a specialist grower and pick up tips here is what is on offer it is carol with some plants that like to get their feet wet
look at this it is different here completely different it is a lot of boggy plants too there is water in here too but there are plants you associate with water already it is getting big and it will be huge just huge but there are a lot of others here too they have tried to show us a few of them from the sublime to the tiny look at this this is from south america it is used in a sort of formal setting but you get the impact of a plant it is never going to reach those sort of proportions it will be this neat ground cover it looks great with these other flowers how do you like that pale pink colour so soft more dainty on a smaller scale than the others look at this i like this l. think that is beautiful do you like that colour look down into this lovely sort of space i'm not sure about the hardiness of these but you could put them out for the summer and let them grow on and then lift them in
queen elizabeth the second park it was very nice for us to be here and for her to visit the exhibit
it was hard to move without seeing hrhs the queen says the colours of the caribbean exhibits make her feel warm she has been to jamaica six times the country's prime minister had flown in becoming the first head of government to greet his head of state at chelsea
finder's garden at the garden for george harrison the queen told the ext beatles widow how fondly he has been remembered
it was something he loved l. think she enjoyed the narrative theme and the colours and recognised george's that people loved him
the queen first came here in nineteen forty seven as princess elizabeth with her parents she rae rarely misses her local flower show this is her forty second visit the daily telegraph garden usually gets a royal visit but that is clue as to whether the queen is a reader for andy sturgeon there was a flicker of recognition for a designer who is becoming a gold medal stalwart
she said she thought it was beautiful and elegant which i think was good description was happy with that
she wasn't talking about you
no well ever you swril to ask her that
she said your onions are rather small she did but she did say i like them smal because enwhen they big they taste of nothing at all
that is about all we have time for tonight our coverage continues tomorrow lunchtime with the team at twelve point three oh and it will be medals day
the exhibitors' work is done and they can now only wait and hope and who knows whether their efforts will be rewarded
well the judges that is who they are still locked away in debate but by midnight their work here will be done for the chelsea champions in waiting just one last night to dream of a golden dawn come take my hand i'll lead us to tomorrow it's time to say sail away the tide is high my love will sail through the years it's time for our journey lovely well they have worked so hard i should think the likes of rachel are pre praying for good night's sleep
she looked tired but a big day tomorrow
hello i am jeremy vine and this is panorama the number of workers on the sick has trebled in the last thirty year at a cost to you the taxpayer of sixteen billion a year
when did you last have a job
it was a long time ago let me think
but are they
now the government is cracking down with tough new rules to separate the sick from the skivers
i am too sick to work l. am skivers too sick to go to work
a million people off the sick by the year two thousand fifteen it is an ambitious target that looks great on paper but can it be done will it create a load more new problems and where with all the jobs come from then again can britain really afford to go on paying as much every year as it is costing to stage the olympics to those on the sick who could really be earning living one in fifteen of the adult population claiming
the start of another day and most of merthyr tydfil is off to work but i am coming to find out why nearly one in five people living here is stuck on the sofa apparently too ill to take a job if the government's serious about getting one million off the sick then it has to work out how to solve a problem like merthyr before breakfast trevor price downs a cocktail of pills he was ormly signed off with back pain bg but over the years he has developed angina arthritis blood clots and depression his granddaughter jenna has never known him to work when trevor first went off sick from his job as a tyre fitter twenty four years ago jenna's mum has just started school
i can't look for work it is no good me looking for work if i didn't can't do it
your tea is ready
panorama filmed with him back then he has just heard his benefit claim has been rejected for the third year running each time a government medical had found him fit for work but three times he appeal and won he hoped
because he can't do things things he would like to do for us but he can't he gist can't and that does get him down just
down the valley one couple have had enough of life on the sick when did you last have a job
smoke about twenty fags but now that is all gone i've give up fags now
what is he going to look at a mother and father on benefits is he going to go on benefits as well we are not showing him are we we are not giving him a great
is peter and rita williams home since being evicted from their council house
have been on and off the sick forure years l. was on it for gastric ulcers and arthritis l. passed out one day in town when they said i suffered an angina attack l. had a bad car crash l. had internal injury they said i
saying i don't think i am fit enough to work at the moment l. can move my hands legs i can talk and there is things i can do but there is things
i can't i am of the school of thought if you can press a button you can work
andrew has lived in merthyr all his life and has worked hard to build up his own small business he is frustrated by the town's reputation
it is almost a career choice to claim incapacity benefit you don't think there is an incentive to get off it there is every incentive for everybody
difficulties so that puts me down a bit
she recently had an incapacity benefit medical is still waiting to hear whether they think she is fit for work her g. p. knows merthyr well mental and physical health here is much poorer than average doctor richards knows whole families who are on the sick which
reputation it was an affluent town with a proud working tradition the coal mines an heavy industry offered decent secure jobs to all who wanted them and but when it all shut down men who had previously worked with bad backs and chest problems suddenly found themselves unemployed and eligible for incapacity benefit l. paid more than the dole and there was no requirement to look for work with soaring unemployment this suited the government at the time as it kept them off the official jobless figures andrew bar i i barry was part of that process when he worked for employment service he advised dozens of miners to go on the sick
i can't believe the amount of people we signed on to incapacity benefit we were told by the managers at the time in a friendly way look you shouldn't be telling them this what you need to tell them is incapacity benefit is the one for them so we signed them on the that because we were their friends you know run bishop absolute rot rubbish l. regret
illness just to get benefit they are people who are sick but it is clear even if one managed to treat the actual medical issue very quickly after about six or seven weeks then it was the beliefs attitudes society issues that affected them more than mere merely the medical problem they started off with
he reckons as many as seventy per cent of incapacity benefit claimants could work with support it is not just illness that stops them though new research has surveyed in detail over three thousand claimants and it has found while a minority want to work many fear they will lose out that it wouldn't pay as much as the package of benefits they get on the sick
for those who say to us they would like a job one of the striking things is that quite a high proportion it is about third of men and one in six women are saying
they would need at least three hundred
week after tax to make it worthwhile coming off benefit and going into work
that is round twenty thousand a year unrealistic perhaps but it is an expectation that the professor thinks has to be tackled
who in their right mind would go to work for less money than you can get for being out of work very few people would do that l. felt very strongly for very long time that we had to encourage people to return to work by giving them more
i thought is you possibly working thirty hours plus as a wage of six an hour
a week
i thought karen would be brave but she is not
it is a hard thing to do though
it is
do you think it is worth it
yes because karen wants to go back to work see l. can't watch him he's too young at the moment he's in a good place
he is hopeful he'll have a job soon pathways to work has struggled to help claimants like him unless that changes the government will
mansel aylward's research suggests that work is generally good for health so we brought him to meet trevor who you will remember has been left alone by the system for the past ten years can the professor persuade him off the sofa
you have a pain in your back you cannot bend to put your socks on you need somebody to give you a hand it gets you down
you don't seem to have confidence in returning to work any way
i don't see it it is not confidence it is now i know i cannot do it and it gets me you know like you said if it was back ten to fifteen years ago maybe i could have gone then but i would be too afraid now
would you go out to meet up with people
no just leave me alone that's all leave me alone i'm happy enough
trevor's story is so typical of the obstacles to work that people have and do exhibit in this area the point is this chap now he is fifty eight he's po got perhaps twenty years ahead of him there are still things we could do to help him return to a better functioning better life even return to work
when i look back on what i used to do ten years ago i was rather a soft touch l. have only ever worked in this community l. l. have not been aware of some of the alternatives that were available l. am much more positive in terms of saying to people when they come for the first time we need to be planning now for your return to work
from next year the government will ask g. p.'s to write well notes which know kus on what patients can do rather than what they can't g. p.'s worry about the effect it will have on their relationships with patients
if i took a hard line and saw my duty was to minimise the cost to the wider community then i could sign some people and say there must be some work you could do it is not my problem that work is not available or not my problem if your employer will not provide it for you here you are you have to go out to work l. don't think that is my role i don't think it is my role
getting job becomes harder when you have been unemployed as long as calvin and karen it has taken seven months just to get them the skills and confidence to apply for work and there is no guarantee of a job although calvin passed his security training six weeks on he is still waiting for his license to come through
working l. will do the house work
but if she does and calvin is still not in work the family will not be as well off as they had hoped had you thought in the mean time about looking for other work while you are waiting for the badge
nationally said they deliberately exclude the long term ill when recruiting staff can new jobs be found for everyone the government wants to get off the sick especially where incapacity benefits are highest the unemployment
is the highest this this is the old industrial britain
the figures
that is just merthyr across the south wales valleys you are looking at thirty five thousand new jobs in glasgow thirty seven thousand new jobs would be required just for people who are currently on the sick never mind the unemployed an ambitious target
increase in the number of jobs we are seeing new jobs created in merthyr new retail jobs t. mobile over the road there are job opportunities we certainly need to see those improvements continuing
we've brought professor aylward to meet peater and rita they have both never had job and have spent years on the sick can he convince
peter and rita have recently been pushed off the sick and on to job seeker's allowance they are officially well for work they have no qualifications and peter has been in and out of jail most recently for drink driving
it will not make
we have to distinguish between somebody being unfit for work and people not able to be employed because of other obstacles i have learnt a lot from you right that is something l. hope
i have not learnt much from you are you saying there are people here for me you get those people there i need to get over them until then i still saying that i am sick to work l. am too sick to go to work
that is not what his incapacity medical found though he has been through board they said he is not sick enough to be on the sick
that is what they are saying probably that is right strictly when you look at all the other obstacles they outweigh any health
nationally sixty per cent of incapacity claimants have no skills at all getting them into work will be tough in merthyr millions of pounds of regeneration money have brought new jobs over the past decade new employers have been surprised at how difficult it is to recruit locally
they will draw on the skill base there across the country we have learnt a lesson that you cannot make those crude assumptions we need to skill people up the last thing we want to do is attract people alone from outside when we have so many people here who could be engaged in this way
if those currently on the sick are not taught the skills employers want and new skills are not created the squeeze on claimants will result in higher unemployment figures if you make that big leap to getting one million off you will have to shift some on to job seekers they will not all get jobs
i want to assure everybody gets the chance of a job
you are confident that by two thousand fifteen we will not have seen an increase in unemployment because of this
i cannot predict what will happen to the unemployment figures over the next seven or eight years but i see no conflict at all between continuing to keep unemployment low and reducing the number of the numbers on incapacity benefit that we have set out
peter and rita have been shifted from one benefit to another when we next catch up with them they've had some more bad news what has happened
they have stopped my benefit they have given me this letter now
i am going to go back on the sick the way things are going i will not get back on it
aspirations of teenagers have changed
hang on let me get the girls out
in a recent survey of girls aged fifteen to nineteen almost two thirds admitted that glamour modelling is their dream job
i just want this so much and i don't wanna go home
but it's a cut throat industry
if we were selling armpits that would be the shot
and only a few make it to the top
no point in starting unless the hair and make up's perfect
for the first time in thirty years glamour agency samantha bond management opens its doors to reveal the tears
some stuff they said i was so good
you are and you are good
the tantrums
you've been in the sport with your clothes on don't put me down cos i've done topless in nuts
and the pressures
they said that i was fat supposedly
this is life as a glamour girl
modelling's not as glamorous as people think it is
coming up amanda lays down the law diva style
there's no point in starting unless the hair and make up's done perfect
will youngest girl on the books ella pass her page three test
i wanna be a bit more of a household name than just a sex symbol
there's confusion over the talents of one of sam's girls
she's actually a dancer no not that type dancer a proper dancer
in central london ella cole arrives for a test shoot seventeen year old ella lives with her parents in wales she recently gave up her fashion modelling career due to the pressures to stay stick thin and is now pursuing glamour
when i was about fourteen as we knew her then jordan you know she was like my idol
two weeks ago the agents called in the youngest girl on their books they needed to be sure she was ready for the glamour industry
i came out of it really cos of the pressures that are on you
because they wanted you so thin they want you so thin yeah
well just let's turn that blue off then and we'll leave pink on one side and just
sun photographer alison webster will be testing ella in lingerie she can't legally model topless until she turns eighteen in three months' time every glamour girl dreams of becoming famous and a regular spot in a best selling tabloid is a way of establishing a name for a new girl like ella
my biggest dream and aspiration probably just to really try and make it as far as possible in the glamour industry doing as much as i can and there's limits to what i would do but lads mags and things like that you know so yeah just sort of being a bit more of a household name than just a sex symbol
but being hired and fired for your sex appeal can be tough especially when you're only seventeen
it's really nerve racking the thing that i'm probably most self conscious about it can be anything really from what your hair looks like to the size of your backside to the size of your legs
come on then let's go
when i get out i feel like a different person it's like you put on a different persona
i mean what about body wise i mean i get told
do you think i need to lose any or just tone it's important
more important to tone and once you're toned then you'd be able to tell if you needed to lose weight it's not you are not overweight are you at all
i got told to tone up but you know it does take time and dedication if you want to be in this industry to your own body there's still that sort of thing that you should really look after yourself still an expectation on you to like look after yourself so you know it's all part of the job really
in a hotel near heathrow sam bond's most famous page three models katie downes and rhian sugden are at autographica an annual event where fans of all kinds come to meet their idols during their page three shoot in tenerife four weeks ago the girls got a taste of being ogled face to face by male onlookers
come on then rhi let's get out come on
oh hell haven't you ever seen a naked woman
but today it's their job to be slightly more friendly to their admirers these are the men who help make the one hundred million men's magazine industry
it's an old people event
despite mixed feelings about the fans katie and rhian will each earn a five hundred fee by living up to their glamour star status
just signature or
will you sign it to barry
a topless one of me
to mark to mark and your mobile number as well
worth a try every time i wonder what people think when they look at your picture cos when you think about it all these men are gonna be like off all your pictures and they're like doesn't that bother you and i'm like i know it's weird but i never actually thought about it
it pays the wages though gets us by
at sam bond's headquarters in chelsea the agents have just received the photos that model louise glover took of promising new star amy diamond the agents spotted the twenty year old on the tube and sent her straight to louise for some test shots
oh that's quite sweet that's nice
yeah that's really sweet
like that oh that's lovely
that's really nice her mouth looks fantastic and her eyes
yeah her expressions are brilliant anyway what we're gonna do is pick about four or five and send them i'm gonna contact marcus from nuts yeah because i think it'd be best to get her in there first yeah so the daily star will see that she's already been commissioned for a shoot and they might wanna make something a bit more special out of her rather than just here she is on page three
to get into britain's best selling weekly lads mag is great exposure for a new model and nuts magazine's established favourites lucy pinder and sophie howard can earn up to four thousand for a cover
oh that's so exciting
i wanna see you all on your knees knees you either wanna be with me or be me come on now maneater make you work hard
three weeks into her miami trip amanda arrives for yet another test shoot
she's a maneater make you buy cars make you cut cards
i think we might have to go
she's a maneater
her american agent rock anderson will try to sell these pictures to the u. s. glossies last week he got amanda a spot on a local radio show to create some hype
you were great how good is she
today's photos are aimed at the new american maxim calendar but there's already a problem the makeup artist is running late
i dunno can you do it on your own or no can't do hair if we're submitting for maxim magazine it has to look amazing i don't know
there's no point starting unless the hair and make up's perfect or it's not worth it
rock do you have any idea how much longer it'll be
she's up the street she's finishing her last girl i'm guessing ten minutes fifteen minutes
we're trying to decide if we should get started without her or
i think so get some stuff on get some stuff done out here
i'm not shooting with no make up and hair then you can't get started there's no point cos for a maxim calendar no chance no way
after another forty five minutes with no sign of the make up artist the first location ends up being the hotel bar
well i'll be around here for a couple of hours i need a shot of something cheers anna tiffany your make up artist
hiya
the makeup artist eventually arrives but there's another hitch
nice to meet you
i think after initial hair and make up it would be nice if you stayed to do the touch ups and stuff but if you have to go the initial hair and make up might be only half hour to an hour right oh you don't do hair i mean i do hair but i didn't bring any oh cos yeah she's going to need hair do you have anything with you in your car
not at all
nothing at all to do hair no tongs no rollers
rock knows he's messed up and needs to think fast
you guys can go and she can start your make up i'll go and get the stuff you need for your hair while she's doing your face i'll run round here there's a wal mart here i'll get you a dryer and what else do you need
i would just need a curling iron and some spray
after investing two thousand to be here amanda is putting all her faith in rock
something like a serum
none of the sixty five models he represents has become a major success so far but he's told amanda she could be a star
in devon nineteen year old jenna sansom is visiting her hometown of totnes she left home three months ago to live in london
this is our local where we go if we go out on a friday and saturday night this is just a normal pub and when i go into london it's like yeah you're on the guest list or whatever and it's like all the top clubs in london so yeah it's just a little bit different
the agency took jenna on only after deciding the young model had lost enough weight to be a sam bond girl
oh you're in you're in good shape now
oh that's brill
yeah well done you've worked hard
yes i have
jenna's meeting up with her best friend charlie which reminds her how much life has changed since she left home
cos it's such a small town everyone gets all excited ooh it's her she gets her tits out for a living
i just look at her as my best mate really it's not something that bothers me but it's funny when other people turn round and go oh and look at her that's quite amusing so yeah
this new found fame might not be quite what jenna had in mind when she started modelling at the family home jenna's friends have come round to spend the evening mum brenda is only just getting used to jenna's new life away from home
when she's in london she looks totally different in a lot of ways cos when i went up to stay she met me off the train and she she was standing there and it was like i looked at her and thought is that jenna i mean she always looks beautiful anyway cos she's just naturally pretty but she just looked like some sort of film star stood there sometimes i do have people say to me you know how do you feel cos jenna's showing herself off to the world as i say because it's what she wants to do and she's happy i've got no qualms with it
don't think people are as fazed by it as if it was forty years ago and my mum doing it people would look differently if back in her time she was doing it now things are more relaxed and people aren't as bothered and don't talk as much you still get the few people that disagree with their parents letting them do it at the end of the day my mum and dad will support them with whatever i want to do come on mother get your tits out
get your tits out for the lads
in miami the sun has set but amanda's shoot hasn't even begun the photographer is only available today so as they wait for rock to return with the hair tongs plan b. is to set up inside one of the hotel rooms
it's not that bad to be honest because we can try and do something with the pool behind you even if that doesn't work out i kind of like the strip of lights there even if it gets dark later you'll still have the strip of lights behind you
just balcony shots no this is two possibilities
but we need spectacular
i haven't seen these maxim calanders have you seen them
have you ever seen the maxim calendar
maxim markets to so many different people why don't we get your make up started and see what we can get
at the agency sam and nicky are trying to devise a plan to kick start louise glover's stalled career
that is lovely say yes to a still of that one yeah
the twenty four year old is struggling to get the work she wants she is starting to work as a photographer even shooting new model amy diamond but she is not prepared to give up modelling yet
i love being in front of that camera i suppose that is why i'm behind it right now because the work isn't there for me to work in front of it
we can approach it now with some new pictures and the fact she has taken up photography that could be interesting in an article later with her
today just do the mags
do we need another couple of shots of her pictures she has actually taken
yes we will do that also you know that pop video she did recently was that with somebody really well known
she does look lovely doesn't she she does she's so lovely she's so lovely she's so lovely she's so lovely
in today's fiercely competitive glamour market the average model's career comes to an end at around twenty five to ensure longevity a model must develop a unique selling point or diversify
good morning is steve beech there please fashion outfits she is looking amazing
if i send over a few shots of her
she has taken up photography and will may be publish a few of her glamour shots good morning simon it's samantha bond here samantha bond
she's looking fabulous
good morning is steve there please have you ever heard of the group scouting for girls
i'll send these over now if that's all right
all right darling it was nice talking to you and hopefully we'll speak very shortly bye bye
sam gets some disappointing news from nuts magazine who are one of their major clients
he was making comments about the fact that they are more inclined to do things on celebrities rather than glamour girls i said i used the word glamour but i'm sure you have celebrities dressed up glamorously he said no if you look at our latest cover they're not in lingerie or bikinis we have basically covered all the bases there we just have to wait for a reply
in miami amanda's make up is nearly done for her maxim calendar shoot and rock has just returned with the crucial hair styling equipment
did you have any luck
i hope so i know nothing about hair
you did good
i don't know what size you wanted
perfect you are smart bringing that bag of cones this curling iron is not doing anything it is calming down your flyaways
what's that
the frizziness it's calming all that down it might just look like you got up and put on your lingerie and make up and that was it
is it really not doing a thing
i'm going to spray it down
that's what he gets for going to wal mart i told him not to go to wal mart
you can still go to wal mart and buy curling irons more than three dollars he got three for three dollars
get him in now rock do you understand what you've done you've bought us three three dollars curling irons and they don't work
the curling irons don't get hot they get lukewarm
i don't know about curling irons it said curling irons so i figured they got hot
we need to sort this hair out i'm scared me too
i don't know anything about curling irons so i ran out to the store to get some curling irons and make the shoot and they were really horrible the make up artist was so good that she made them work in spite of how horrible they were i'm going to keep the receipt i'm taking them back it all worked out she looks beautiful we'll get the work done
expressions open your mouth great nice
i can't smile because my mouth is dry as a bone and my eyeballs are dry so i can't smile
close your eyes we're done we're done it's a wrap they're nice shots they're not spectacular but it's simple
simplicity can be good sometimes
simplicity isn't what amanda was really after
feels like some kind of rush
jenna's back in london for her regular shoot at the star page three studio
hiya it's jenna
she's been featured in the newspaper ten times in the past year
what do we think about these leg warmers yes or no
i think they're cute
let me see what i've got in here
the one hundred eighty jenna gets paid per shoot is just pocket money compared to the six hundred a month she spends a month to live in london appearing in a national newspaper raises her profile
try that hat on sweetheart will you maddie can you do that for me darling
the price she pays for the privilege is constant scrutiny of her body before her picture even hits the news stand
she has a nice body when she started she was a bit podgy but she's toned up now and is coming into her own
i don't necessarily think i've lost any weight i don't think i was fat in a first place i think i was exactly the same but there you go
and up you come good nice get rid of that hair there can someone keep an eye on this hair and what's happening here up you come other side up you come closer together up and not boobs touching no sexy faces have we got any feet wipes filthy dirty girl look at you mucky pup she's young fresh nice boobs guys are different some guys like big boobs some small ones some medium she comes in our medium bracket she has got a great little face and i think she'll go far let's have a little looky here can we tan her skin up a bit
that's nice that's better i like it it's lush yeah it's really cool
one sam bond girl who's becoming jaded by the london glamour scene is twenty year old gemma hiles gemma's been a glamour girl for two and half years working for several magazines including fast car these days she's spending more and more time at her parents' home in lancashire
the novelty of it soon wears off you love it at first and you're out there partying which is a good thing cos you get your name around but then you get bored of it you just want to get back to your family and friends that you can have a proper night out with
the biggest perk of being at home more is cut price maintenance from beauty therapist mum yvonne
in castings if you take your portfolio and they look at your pictures but if you don't look like that in real life they're going to notice that it would be a lot of work involved to make you look like that if you go looking like your pictures how you advertise yourself you're going to get a better chance of getting the job
with most glamour work happening in london gemma's now considering a future beyond modelling
i've just started college doing a casino course where we've got to use the poker chips and cut the chips and stuff it is a bit difficult to have nails on for that so i've had to take them off which was a bit of a nightmare
they're done let them dry for a bit sit still like you normally can't
hi guys
near oxford circus louise glover arrives at celebrity nightclub moveda but she's not here to party she's used her own contacts to appear in a fashion show for designer clothing brand ed hardy it is not paid work but it's a chance to show off her modelling skills to a potential new client
this is my time to shine and show people this is what i look like this is the real me show my personality give them a twirl
it's a fashion show it's just not glamour and i'm happy about it because i'm modelling clothes and i feel sexier with clothes on
it is good for me to be breaking away from the glamour i've done too much of it you go in at eighteen i'm twenty four now i need to break into newer things
louise has also roped in her husband ben they've been married for a year and the twenty eight year old scaffolder is usually more at home on a building site than a catwalk
she used to go to celebrity parties before she met me i am a scaffolder just a nice person i treat her with respect i never cheat on her or anything like that she looked at me and looked past the footballer the stereotype a lot of models they want to go for who they are and not what they are she sees me for what i am and that's what made me fall in love with her
both ben and louise are a big hit with the clubbers next time on glamour girls amanda discovers the true cost of working abroad
are you missing me yes i miss you too
katie adds a touch of glamour to the high street
there we go thank you very much
is amy brave enough to reveal all her assets
i remember getting our very first television it was enormous about that size except the screen was about that size nine inches black and white but on it i saw my very first wildlife programmes that was fifty years ago fifty years before that the very first wildlife film appeared so there had been one hundred years of wildlife film making and i reckon it's time we looked back in this two hour special we'll be featuring the passionate intrepid and sometimes eccentric individuals who've gone to the ends of the earth to open up new worlds to viewers we'll chart the extraordinary changes in technology that have driven the industry and we'll look at how we the audiences have been entertained and affected by what we've seen on our screens indeed this century of wildlife films may reveal as much about us as about the animals themselves
this programme contains some scenes that some viewers may find upsetting
throughout history first drawings then paintings then sculptures books eventually cameras first stills then movies and always the favourite subject wildlife now let's face it animals don't actually rehearse and they don't work on their image like they say in show business but the fact of the matter is in front of the cameras they are naturals
the pups try their best to keep alert along with their parents but it's a bit of a struggle when you've just woken up
right from the very beginning film makers recognised that animals had a huge entertainment value this somewhat bizarre footage is the earliest known moving image of a wild animal it was pictures like this that inspired one man in particular when he wrote the actual movements of the wild creatures can now be captured the secrets and all the wonders of nature can be brought to the platform alive and i was determined to do it and do it he did he was oliver pike who made the first fully fledged wildlife film to be seen in britain back in nineteen oh seven it was called in bird land and it was a great success the proceeds funded pike's second and even more popular film about the birds and people of saint kilda this of course was long before the invention of television so pike showed his fifteen minute movies wherever cinemas had begun to spring up in britain america and across the empire and people flocked and paid to wonder at them saint kilda isn't a cosy place to film even today back then it was really remote and the camera equipment well it wasn't exactly what you'd call portable this is the kind of equipment that pike would have used it's made out of finest mahogany or some other endangered tree no doubt believe me it is incredibly heavy you face it the right way birds over there film is in here of course spool there spool there it's going to go round and round how does it go round this rather fetching brass handle this is rather noisy this is the way it goes so chances are the first time he did that all the birds would woah out of here because it sounds like a machine gun doesn't it so he had a cunning plan he was going to have to get them used to that kind of noise he didn't want to cart his camera up there every time and not actually use any film if you see what i mean so here's ingenuity for you he collected up some pebbles like this he'd remembered to bring a tin can probably had baked beans in it pebbles into the can and he'd go up into the sea bird colony and go and after i imagine several days possibly several weeks they finally got used to this oh it's just that nutty bloke with his tin can so the next time he came up with his camera he placed the camera down birds over there rattled his tin can it's all right lads just the tin can then he would stop that and immediately start doing that a sort of aural splice and the birds just sat there and thought it's all right we're not being filmed it's just a tin can it wasn't and he got some truly historic pictures aw it's flown away of course nesting birds don't fly away and they were a favourite subject although it was still a precarious business filming them it also required a lot of ingenuity and indeed camouflage yep that is the first example of cow cam relishing and overcoming apparently insurmountable problems is one of the hallmarks of a wildlife film maker and the most intrepid of them all was cherry kearton
yes it really is surprising that i should be sitting safely here to tell this story for only by a series of miracles have i escaped death as you shall see
kearton's driving ambition was to capture images the world had never seen before he was soon lured away from birds in britain by faraway africa it was in east africa that kearton did indeed make history by capturing the first moving images of african animals
the ability simply to get the shots was the big thing how you put them together was very much of less importance and what cherry kearton did was get the shots he got amazing shots
not only was kearton the first to film africa's wildlife but he did so at a time when national parks didn't even exist and telephoto lenses were a thing of the future what's more in those days travel was a very far from easy as kearton's wife ada explains
i'd never been there before and i went on my first safari with cherry of course it was very difficult in those days to what it is today although and the early days of cherry for instance when he had to cross rivers and that sort of thing he had to walk on foot but he went really in the hard way you know yes he had such a wonderful way of understanding animals i found him very interesting
kearton combined a love of wildlife with a taste for adventure and i think that's a combination that most wildlife film makers have had ever since of course the advent of commercial air travel and lighter camera equipment did make things a little bit easier nevertheless getting to some remote locations was and still is pretty difficult whoa and a nineteen fifty six version of david attenborough agrees with me
a month ago charles lagus and i returned from spending four months in search of a dragon or to put it another way in search of the largest lizard in the world it lives on one tiny little island in the south pacific and nowhere else in the world at all the name of the island is komodo and i have to admit that before we started planning this expedition i had no idea where komodo was and had to look for it on the map the first night we went onto a coral reef bumping up and down the captain was asleep so we poled ourselves off the coral reef the next night we were becalmed and the next day i went down to him and i said you have been there before haven't you and he said blmmm i looked up and he said not yet you see so at last we sailed safely into the wide calm bay of komodo this was the home of the dragon which we'd come so far to see within half an hour there was a rustle in the bush and there was the dragon he looked almost as though he had walked out of some prehistoric age this was tremendously exciting for us our first sight of this magnificent monster the climax of four months of arduous travel
and getting to unexplored places still isn't straightforward as cameraman gavin thurston found out when he set off to film lowland gorillas in the congo eight hours after leaving gatwick
are we at the wrong airport yes we're at the wrong airport
day two and the crew manage to find the right airport
all right james heads or tails
that is tails so where am i
you can decide i'll go in front
day three a seventeen hour dusty truck journey in a vehicle that isn't well it isn't exactly a rolls royce
how's the journey guys
what do you think
and after that none too luxurious ride not even a shower they're into canoes for a fourteen hour trip down the congo
just the bare essentials on this trip
day six just when they think they've arrived there's still three hours to go on foot
it's actually quite a pleasant walk shame we have to cart all this blooming film gear with us we've finally arrived at the first of the three amazingly we've seen our first silverback gorilla it's encouraging to know that they're actually here we've seen one within the first few minutes
frankly to see the animal you're hoping to film within the first few minutes is um a miracle it's one of the inescapable facts of wildlife filming or indeed wildlife watching it doesn't matter how far you've travelled or how arduous the journey there's absolutely no guarantee whatsoever that what you're hoping to see will turn up immediately or will turn up at all
scene ten take two
and i can't see a single hare well that's the problem you've got first of all to find your hares and then to get close to them without alarming them cut this is the tropical rainforest famous for being the richest proliferation of life on earth so where are the animals bill what's happening
well i suppose the word that would sum it up at the moment kate is nothing simon yes bill i'm with you mate there's absolutely nothing at all happening here either
well here i am i'm looking at the monitors
look at my screen here we've got these infra red lights on various things and what have we got up there at the moment channel one we have absolutely nothing well i'll be honest i can't see anything at all so i'm not going to bother to show them to you some animals aren't just camera shy they take elusiveness to the brink of invisibility when cameraman doug allen set off to film snow leopards in the himalayas it certainly tested his patience
this is tedious stuff this is the seventh session that i've done i do three hours in the morning three hours in the late afternoon not a sign if you got just a little bit of hint a wee bit of a sighting now and again your spirits would be lifted but right now i'd swap a little bit of this animal's charisma for a little bit more visibility
air on a g. string by j. s. bach
five days that's thirty five hours of watching nothing no cats
after seven weeks of waiting doug did get a glimpse of the elusive snow leopard but surely not enough to make a proper sequence in the gobi desert the bactrian camels proved to be almost as reluctant to be filmed as the snow leopard it was eight days before this crew got their first sighting of camels and even then it was just their rear ends disappearing into the distance
about three or four kilometres away they spotted us from that distance that's going to be a problem getting close they're capable of spotting us from about five kilometres and running for seventy k. s. in the opposite direction so this is what's going to make the filming incredibly difficult
it wasn't until day thirty six that they got pictures of anything except camels running away
not only did they start getting head shots of camels but fascinating behaviour strange mating rituals and snow eating wild camels remain one of our planet's least known animals so this unique footage was much needed publicity for a species on the verge of extinction
one year later proof that wildlife filmmakers don't give up easily a new location a new team an old quest that elusive cat again this time they had to dodge falling boulders but luck was on their side
we just got a report that there's a snow leopard up on the ridge we're too low where we were before just trying to get some height just to get a better view of it
hello good evening now heinz sielmann has come all the way from munich to show us the film tonight and so here he is and we're very pleased to see you here heinz
well i was successful in finding a black woodpecker's nest which was not higher up than about twenty yards
twenty feet twenty feet pardon that's high enough anyway oh yes
to make a hole in the back of the nest heinz could only chisel for thirty minutes every five hours to ensure that the birds continued to incubate after ten days he put in a pane of glass surrounded by a camouflaged hide he then spent a further eight days accustoming the birds to electric light so that's a total of eighteen days before getting a single shot
well now can we see the pictures that you took in the back of the
i hope we were successful by that work yes
and back in the wood where the nests are here's the black woodpecker bringing food to its newly hatched young and now down she goes inside the nest like father christmas coming down the chimney she wakes the young ones up and she feeds each one by regurgitation of course they're blind when they hatch out and very undeveloped it think it's really very exciting to think of these pictures the first pictures ever taken of woodpeckers actually inside their nesting hole
when his woodpecker film came just suddenly into our look programme it really revolutionised it that night the switchboard was jammed for an hour or so afterwards it got the biggest appreciation figure the b. b. c. had ever had except for the coronation and it pointed the way
heinz had set a new standard for everyone else to follow the huge popularity of heinz sielmann's films indicated the public's appetite for seeing things from a new angle or new perspective but the fact of the matter is that for quite some time some of the very best places and some of the most interesting wildlife was quite literally unfilmable and the reason is that film requires quite a lot of light in order to register an image and quite a lot of wildlife on the other hand prefers to live in places that are distinctly murky
the first time we went into a rainforest in west africa charles lagus who was the cameraman looked up and said well we can't film there's simply not enough light
there are few large animals in the west african forest and the only one we have any chance of seeing is a monkey there's one sitting hidden in the treetop quietly feeding
so in fact what we did was to largely film just very wide angle scenes of jack tramping around and all the detailed close ups of the animals we actually did in the studio
as more and more sensitive film stock was developed it was no longer necessary to cheat the shots by nineteen ninety sir david could film the superb bird of paradise deep in the tropical undergrowth and seventeen years later the high definition camera rendered the same bird crystal clear
dance of the hours from la gioconda by amilcare ponchielli
but there was an even bigger challenge than filming in the half light of a tropical rainforest a huge number of animals rather inconveniently are only active at night when producer amanda barrett and cameraman owen newman set off to film leopards in the serengeti they began by using light sensitive video cameras that could produce colour images even with low levels of light for example at dusk but they soon discovered that leopards only like to hunt when it's absolutely pitch dark because it's then that they're invisible to their prey so the crew change plan and they began to film with infra red infra red can only produce images in black and white but the advantage is it's invisible to wildlife which means it just carries on behaving naturally
and the exciting thing was at night the way they were stalking in the open they were using the cover of darkness to creep up on the animals the antelope were using their ears and noses to detect any danger that was out there and so the leopard had to be incredibly quiet and the first time we saw a leopard stalking in the open putting just one foot down it would take maybe two minutes to find a place where its foot was able just to find a bit of ground that wasn't rustling it would put it there it would stay and all the time just concentrating on ahead
in their eagerness to snatch a kill hyenas try to shadow hunting leopards but with their clumsy attempts to find the leopard in the dark they often interrupt and spoil a hunt
the invisible nature of infra red lights means that at least the film makers won't be the ones to spoil the hunt elephants might not enter these caves in kenya if they sense a camera crew inside but with remote infra red cameras david attenborough could remain out of sight and still find out what was luring the elephants underground
it sounds like distant thunder it's an elephant every foot is being placed very carefully oh he bumped his head well no one's perfect the passage here is so narrow the big male can only just squeeze through and now i can hear that noise he's using his tusks to carve out the salt and of course it's falling to the ground so what he does now is use his trunk to sniff it up and then blow it into his mouth you can hear that too
so infra red cameras have helped discover what goes on in the darkness of the night and inside caves but that's not all they've also revealed some of the secrets of the beaver's private life
no one knew exactly what went on inside the lodge during winter so when the beavers were away we installed a couple of infra red cameras in order to find out a branch from the fridge is being brought back to the lodge for the whole family to feed on and another no wonder they don't need to hibernate with this ingenious set up the lodge is warm and safe even in midwinter and the only sign of activity in the snug home beneath the snow is hot air rising from the vent at the top inside our cameras catch a glimpse of what at first sight looks like a very small beaver it's a muskrat there are a pair of them in here this is a new observation do the beavers actually know in the pitch blackness that there are strangers among them we notice that the muskrats regularly left the lodge to forage under the ice and on several occasions they returned a few minutes later with a load of fresh reeds perhaps the muskrats are paying rent by regularly providing fresh bedding for the lodge maybe that is why the beavers accept them and even allow them to share their food our infra red lights however are no longer welcome it seems
the fact is with ever advancing technology you can film just about anything if it's dark night camera just a long way away telephoto lens and if it's very very small well time was you'd have to use a microscope but the world of microscopes and cameras was beginning to converge ooh there you go one of the first to try his hand with macro photography was pioneering cameraman percy smith the trouble was the lenses needed to magnify such tiny creatures required an awful lot of light and lights are hot so to put not too fine a point on it the heat often fried the insects he was trying to film so some clever bods at oxford scientific films gerald thompson and eric skinner devised a way of defusing heat given off from their massive lights so that they could film tiny insects without cooking them basically they created a cooling system with a flask of water and some glass heat filters having done that they could get images like these
ah lovely yes jolly good
today the high definition camera is sensitive enough to film animals as small as insects with minimal light and lenses can now be smaller than a fingernail combine that with a motion control system like this one designed by cameraman martin dawn and we can see insects on their level and get a real sense of what it's like to live in their world
you get a lovely sense of motion a sense of tracking you can you know flying in a helicopter at the moment over these extraordinary gigantic plants it's just given me and hopefully others a new perspective on the world
a miniature world inhabited by animals smaller than a pinhead
they are tiny this minute little creature is a springtail it is less than half a millimetre long the size of a full stop drying out is a very real danger for them and some waterproof themselves regularly with a droplet of special grooming fluid you might even say that they have turned bathing into an art form they even have two inflatable tubes that enable them to get to those hard to reach places to help them get around through the leaf litter these springtails as their name suggests have a rather novel way of jumping they have a tiny two pronged lever beneath their abdomen one small flick from it can catapult them six inches some fifteen centimetres into the air it's the equivalent of a human being jumping over the eiffel tower and if they happen to land upside down well they have a special way of righting themselves they use their grooming fluid dispenser to stick on to the ground so that they can pull themselves back onto their feet
so far we had only been doing natural diving but i had equipment for two alternatives to this and i wanted to put these to the test the first was an air pump with a pipeline leading to a diving helmet it was made of a transparent plastic and simply stood on the wearer's shoulders alfred was to try it first and hans was to pump
movement was limited because the air supply was still attached to the boat
i went to see how alfred was making out and he seemed very happy indeed hans pumped away in the boat and for the first time alfred was not at the mercy of his lungs he could breathe as easily as if he were on land and so long as he kept within the range of the air tube could wander at will on the bed of the sea my second piece of apparatus was much more exciting and i resolved to give no one but myself the pleasure of going below with this for the first time it was a lightweight oxygen equipment one of the earliest ever made xenophon helped me to put it on just as one's first glimpse of a foreign land one's first flight one's first love remains forever implanted in the memory so does my first underwater exploration with portable oxygen equipment gone is every shackle gone is the tyranny of the lungs the deadly oppression that forces you to surface every minute or two just when the most exciting vistas are opening before your eyes
a series aptly called the private life of plants
strange though it may seem some plants can move not just their flowers and their leaves but they can travel from place to place take for example this bramble
put brambles into fast forward and they take on a life of their own instead of taking twenty five pictures a second as film cameras do the process of time lapse takes pictures much less frequently when the image is played back this is the result we see a world we are normally blind to because we're moving at a very different pace apart from showing plants in a new light time lapse photography has also revealed fascinating relationships in the natural world when filming a private life of plants in borneo the crew noted that the leaves of the ginger plant were heavily damaged
look at this clearly it is a badly damaged leaf but where is the creature that is doing the damage
by speeding up events we could find out just what was going on
this is it a tiny caterpillar it's soft it's defenceless it's clearly an excellent mouthful for many a bird so if it is to survive it has to take steps to protect itself it starts by making a semicircular cut into the leaf from the margin but when the cut is only half complete it starts from the other end it spins silk across the hinge that as it dries contracts and helps the caterpillar pull over the segment to form a roof to make its tent a little more commodious it cuts a pleat pulls it across and now it it's got a little wigwam the whole process only takes a few hours and is usually done at night when there are no birds around now the caterpillar can feed in safety shaving off the soft surface layers of the leaf out of the sight of any hungry bird and at significant cost to the plant
whilst plants need speeding up for us to see what is really going on most animals can be appreciated better by slowing them down
its torpedo shape strong jaws and awesome muscle power make the great white the most powerful of all predatory sharks it's the lion of the ocean
as early as nineteen thirty four a film about gannets used the technique of slow motion to show for the first time exactly how these birds were using their wings to land
when landing the gannet seems to just flop down anyhow but slow motion reveals controlled power the tail spread as a brake the wings beating backwards to reduce the speed the feet outstretched to take the shock they must land exactly on their own nest or they'll be pecked and harried by the birds through whose territories they pass here's the perfect landing
this revelation won the film makers the u. s. academy award now known as the oscar for best one reel short subject
slow motion shows the full beauty and strength of their flight
at that time it was only possible to film at a slightly higher speed than normal but today specialised video cameras can slow down action as much as one thousand times turning seconds into minutes this was a technique used in the b. b. c. series animal camera
the mantis shrimp voracious hunter of the coral reefs with probably the fastest punch of any animal devastating to even the hardest snails how the shrimp generates the force to do this has baffled scientists for years until now that is by combining the slow motion camera with an underwater force meter we can finally see the astonishing truth the meter shows the shrimp's punch packs a staggering sixty kilograms of force not so much a punch as a hammer blow this huge impact is all down to the sheer speed of the strike game over in one thousandth of a second the speed comes from compressing this part of the claw and storing energy which is released in this explosive burst with the acceleration of a bullet the camera also revealed another amazing event flashes of light moments before impact a pressure wave in front of the claw causes the water to boil the steam immediately implodes generating light heat and possibly adding to the destructive force
now one of the rhinos has discovered martin and o. s. a. with their cameras slowly the great beast comes on his huge horn menacing
in those days it was great entertainment to see animals being shot
hunting safaris were at their height and it was a time when the west saw nature as something not to be understood but to be conquered
o. s. a. lets go another bullet and the rhino rears into the air and thrashes madly about for a second and then drops dead in his tracks
the johnsons employed hollywood techniques like back projection to add to the drama
closer and closer goes the boat alert for whatever move the croc may make and there it comes there's a sudden lunge and he throws himself straight at the boat phew that was a close one the party is all safe
well they had no knowledge of animal behaviour that's for sure
there's a mean look in those eyes and she's about made up her mind to charge the boat no she's used her woman's privilege and changed her mind
yes well in fact their patronising attitude to animals wasn't dissimilar to their attitude to people
and it was with deep regret that we said goodbye to the happiest little savages on earth
in contrast to the johnsons britain's first wildlife presenter cherry kearton was keen to make his subjects not himself the centre of the show
ladies and gentlemen let me put you out of your misery at once you are not going to see me for long although i'm inviting you to come on this trip with me you will only see me occasionally for my story of penguin island is about the strangest little creatures that bear a remarkable resemblance to human beings at first sight they look like millions of tiny charlie chaplins at least about the feet
kearton's style was not only self effacing it was undeniably anthropomorphic and if you like popularist but this was partly because back in those days there wasn't very much scientific knowledge the fact is though kearton had a genuine love for and interest in animals
i rested for a while on the terrace watching a few thousands of my neighbours going about each other's business before long i realised that unless i kept a close watch on my belongings i'd feel the pinch for pinching was a recognised profession in this land a sort of what's yours is mine if you're not looking principle
of course for the filmmaker to be in front of the camera somebody else had to be behind it in kearton's case it was his wife ada
am i right that when you were married you gave up your singing career altogether
oh yes i did but i think you've been wondering i gave it up
yes well because there's so many singers but there was only one cherry kearton
he was a freelance performer he had a passion for wildlife of course but he had to as it were sell it to an audience and he sold it through his own personality
in nineteen forty cherry kearton died suddenly as he left the b. b. c.'s broadcasting house in london
he was one of the great pioneers he was as good as anybody in his time and i would have thought ahead of almost everybody and certainly in terms off affecting his audience including small boys like me he was out there on his own
really this is a wonderful sight five million penguins surrounding me braying their national anthem and cheering me on my way i am filled with sadness at leaving
kearton managed to combine authoritative insight into animal behaviour with entertaining an audience and that to a lot of people qualifies him as the rightful founder of wildlife film making rather ironically though kearton's death coincided with the birth of television the medium of course in which wildlife presenters positively proliferated ironically though shortly after its arrival t. v. shut down for the duration of the second world war and it wasn't until nineteen fifty three that wildlife programmes first appeared on the telly the new presenters added authority and information to their films changing the focus away from pure entertainment perhaps in response to the post war resolution to rebuild britain through education first and foremost was sir peter scott peter scott was the son of the famous antarctic explorer captain scott who died when peter was five months old it was his father's dying wish that his son would be interested in wildlife
my father really wanted me to be interested in natural history and he wrote a message to my mother in the tent where he died in the antarctic which got found the next spring when they were there and it was a letter in which he said make the boy interested in natural history it is better than games they teach it at some schools
his father's wishes were most certainly granted peter scott was to become knighted for his work in conservation he set up the world wildlife fund and he sold many of his paintings to raise money and he almost single handedly saved this species the hawaiian goose from extinction and they're very grateful what's more peter scott presented the very first wildlife television programme and he did it live from slimbridge in gloucestershire which is exactly where i am now
whilst he's doing that i would like to show you one or two birds that we've got on the water here here are some red breasted geese
in fact ironically peter had started off as a wildfowler one of the top punt gunners of his day
i'm bound to say that i passed through a period and i don't i hate remembering it but i don't want to cover it up because it's true there was a time when i really took a great delight in successfully er killing i hate to think it was so but it was so
when he came to slimbridge wildfowling was still going on here and he saw a female goose wounded female goose lying out on the sands and the male standing by it for hours on end and i think he thought that wasn't very nice and he decided he wasn't going to do any more shooting hello good evening
his best known series look like other programmes at this time was broadcast live from a studio television cameras in the fifties were far too cumbersome to be taken into the field
marvellous now on your marks get set go now don't go do you want to get out come on
it ran for twelve years surprising everyone by its popularity not least scott himself
nobody believed natural history was going to be something that lots of people would want to look at and then quite suddenly when it took off it became enormously exciting because then one suddenly realised my goodness we're getting to all these people this is what i'd been dreaming about and then it really was very exciting a nice restful job snail watching
what peter scott was becoming the face of british wildlife programmes competition was beginning to appear in the rest of europe
here ve see heinz sielmann engaged in a life or death struggle vith peter scott they are engaged in a bitter punch up over repeat fees and the overseas sales of their nature documentaries now they have been joined by an enraged jacques cousteau zis is typical of the harsh and bitchy vorld of television features
the dashing frenchman jacques cousteau was becoming the face of underwater films with cutting edge images like these
night and day head to tail in lockstep the spiny lobsters march
alongside the already known austrian film maker hans hass who had now teamed up with his wife lotte
on this my first dive with oxygen i met and photographed a shark
like peter scott hans had also been a keen hunter but he and lotte began to reflect the post war feeling of the time
i discovered how much more exciting and how much more useful it would be if instead of killing these trusting defenceless creatures i could photograph them in their natural surroundings
i don't like killing fish either
until next time then
and whilst these presenters became linked with underwater films another husband and wife team became the faces of films about african wildlife armand and michaela denis from belgium
the search for gertie and it is the search for gertie which brought us to amboseli
you had better explain who gertie is oh yes
here it is a female rhinoceros
which is exactly what david did and continues to do
here in the tiny comoro islands here in the tropical rainforest of sumatra six feet beneath the surface of the earth two hundred miles south of java fine ash is falling all around at night it gets so cold that it can freeze that makes this the deepest valley in the world this is one of the coldest places on earth here there's virtually no water at all this is one of the wettest places on earth this is the biggest flower in the world this snow is not white this is the biggest creature that exists on the planet the blue whale and it's coming up it's coming up there
david's fascination for the natural world was kindled at a young age
the family used to go on holiday in north wales on anglesey dave would disappear you couldn't find dave anywhere he was on the beach and would collect not only anything that moved but fossils he absolutely adored fossils
so it was no surprise he would one day appear on our t. v. screens grappling with animals in far off places for his first series zoo quest the series involved catching wild animals for zoos which isn't something you'd find attenborough doing today but it's a clear reminder of how attitudes have changed fifty years since his first t. v. appearance it'd be hard to find anyone who doesn't recognise david attenborough or even an imitation of him
tonight on life on earth we look at a creature whose survival in the modern world continues to baffle scientists and laymen alike
so what is it about him that's made him so popular to this day is it his charisma his credibility his never ending enthusiasm or his respectful non intrusive approach which accounts for those characteristic hushed tones
there is more meaning and mutual understanding in exchanging a glance with a gorilla than any other animal i know
in contrast to many early presenters david has always shone the spotlight on the animals not himself which is why if you've ever wondered we always see him wearing the same clothes
people say why do you always wear the same thing it seems to me that if you change your costume and wear i don't know some kind of i don't know some kind of fashionable thing people say why has he done that is it trying to tell us something has the climate changed you know what's he trying to do so you are asking for attention away from what it is you're trying to talk about and his sole object in life at the moment is to make quite sure that he and he alone mates with every single one of them and to that he must fight
since the beginning of his career sir david has had more than a lifetime's worth of interesting encounters
when i caught up with them at the top of the pass i found to my horror that the men were refusing to go any further they told me very firmly that this was the end of their tribal frontier i said now come on lads and they said no good no good i said why not they said we no go along him why not that means they're cannibals down there i said now lads if it's another sixpence a day you want you know we can have a proper organised talk about this you know and they said no no him no good him bad fellow and while i was actually saying this with me being very british about the whole thing i suddenly looked down the slope and i saw behind a tree a white cockatoo feather flash and i turned round again and there behind a boulder was the glint of a knife i thought oh and while i was in the process of thinking oh suddenly out onto the track about seventy or eighty men suddenly jumped out of hiding and ran down towards us brandishing spears and waving knives and to say i was alarmed is to put it mildly charles lagus who was my companion at the time with the camera had the presence of mind he'd got it in his hand simply to turn it so i know actually what happened what happened was i walked towards this screaming horde of men and i actually heard myself i stuck out my hand and i heard myself say good afternoon it's true to my enormous relief they greeted me not fiercely but with considerable enthusiasm laughing at myself i discovered that this in fact is merely the normal new guinea welcome
hello isn't it rotten when you can't think of anything to do yes now let me have the hose wendy wendy
contrary to popular belief johnny morris was not a professional zoo keeper he was an entertainer his playful humour and anthropomorphism is reminiscent of the early days of kearton but johnny morris took it one step further he put words into the animals' mouths dear me
are you feeling quite quiet today i am feeling quiet thank you we are just simple animals what is living a simple life and liking very much all the leaves that kind people are bringing to us from time to time yes and i would like to second that good i mean look at the clouds i know i just wanted to take him out today oh dear perhaps the sun will shine tomorrow perhaps i can sit on your lap oh yes are you quite comfortable you are that's good yeah oh my goodness me is that all right for you how's the little one don't you think you ought to support his head like this look if you're so blinking clever you nurse him go on there get on with it some people think they know the lot
and some people bridled at the level of anthropomorphism but johnny morris's fun filled series ran for twenty one years
would you allow me to pull a little bit of your coat off no they here it is it comes off oh it comes off
the series that replaced it turned out to be equally popular and ran for the same length of time
we'd better cut there and start again
it was called the really wild show
sh right hello and welcome to this the really wild show that's right the really wild show and a big welcome from nick chris and myself to this the very first in a brand new series of natural history programmes from bristol
by now a whole new generation of wildlife presenters were running jumping and leaping onto our screens
i need one of these and a peregrine falcon
go go
i can see the headlines now wildlife presenter killed by assassin bug
this is the best way in the world to see elephants they pass right underneath you but they have absolutely no idea that you're here
being kicked by a gorilla i think is a privilege
the biggest scottish river is this one the tay
you've probably heard they're also learning to trumpet which they seem to quite enjoy doing oh
what have we found a couple of pairs mating over here
two of them three of them go go go go go
good hunting lesson number one pretty successful
wow
believe me i've had ants in my pants and it's nothing compared to having a fiddler crab in your shorts
in just a matter of minutes i've attracted literally hundreds of beetles and all with the tiniest drop of pheromone
these are the moments i live for where time stands still
so join me on an adventure into a mysterious world
i feel very much like an astronaut that has just touched down on the planet of penguins a place inhabited by monochromatic dwarfs go go go
without my clothes i a. m. going to die
all right mate
yes well we all have our own styles and indeed our own thresholds of modesty but i do think a presenter can add something to a wildlife programme by bringing in a certain style or attitude or being a sort of a guide but then i would say that wouldn't i the fact of the matter is though there are many wildlife films that have no human involvement whatsoever but they simply astonish us by their truly pioneering nature and in this case the pioneers themselves are the film makers especially those who are prepared to take a few risks in a series kingdom of the ice bear producer mike salisbury braved sub zero temperatures and dangerous predators to film polar bears emerging from their winter hibernation
we were absolutely determined to capture that moment when a mother bear brings out her cubs for the first time we had two sleds on the back of each snowmobile loaded with camping gear food fuel everything we needed for six weeks we found one den after about four weeks and it seemed to be perfect we built a sort of half an igloo as a hide set it up and then she came out wandered down the side of the hill and off down the valley and that's the last we saw of her we thought oh no there was no sign of cubs having been there at all we'd chosen perhaps the one den in the whole of spitsbergen where a mother bear had had a false pregnancy right i mean i think in the last week of the rations and fuel and everything we had um we found a den on a slope above the sea ice we made another sort of igloo hide in the end the mother came out and we were really lucky because she did this wonderful sort of sliding down on her back out of the den with her legs in the air you really felt that she was delighted to be out after all those weeks in the den and then the next day she went back and got the cubs out and we got our sequence phew
within a few days of opening the den a mother bear will take the cubs on short outings strengthening their legs for longer journeys across the sea ice a third cub has surfaced but is too nervous to join the others although on this first outing the attentive mother will not take them far from the safety of the den
here at its moorings is scheme one mark one the idea was that joan should lie in the appropriately coffin shaped hull and do the filming while alan punted her to suitable locations she was to film through the glass front of this particular craft and use the thing as a mobile hide well that was the idea so they set sail in scheme one mark one and headed both for deeper water and for hippos or crocodiles or whatever trouble the hippos sheered off and the glass steamed up so squeegeeing was necessary but there wasn't much point even in clean glass if there was nothing to see and so they moved on to scheme two to see if that would work
if anything this is an even bigger failure than the floating tank although it's certainly a lot cooler the way it works is i put my feet through holes in the bottom then lift the cage up on my shoulders and walk around following the hippo in theory
what it gained in coolness it lost in manoeuvrability also when birnam wood came to mzima the wind would catch hold of it and would care not a fig for the man below for the man who was in theory at the helm of mark one scheme two so they left scheme two and mainly took to snorkelling instead although the cages did have their uses skin diving was infinitely more practical but with limbs totally exposed it meant keeping a very good lookout at all times on a normal underwater camera and then swimming as close to the quarry as one dared to go
the roots' ingenuity and perseverance had paid off and they'd achieved exactly what they set out to do their film mzima made history by showing hippos underwater for the very first time it was a remarkable achievement but not without mishap not only did alan get bitten through the leg when he found himself in the middle of two male hippos fighting but joan also had an incredibly narrow escape a tooth passed millimetres from her face tearing the mask and breaking the glass but incredibly leaving joan unmarked undeterred by their encounters the roots continued to work with dangerous animals alan achieved these remarkable shots of this cobra spitting out its lethal venom at you guessed it his wife joan
spectacles are enough to protect the eyes and if it's quickly washed off the venom doesn't harm the skin
wild animals are unpredictable and sometimes a dangerous situation comes out of the blue
lacking a dart to deliver the vital antidote there was only one thing to do to try to inject it by hand
elephant biologist iain douglas hamilton felt duty bound to administer the antidote to save the stricken animal's life but think about it the camera man dieter plage his life was also in danger but he carried on filming
when that failed to drive in close was the only hope the needle went home and so did sarah's cross tusks having as she thought wiped out her enemy she backed off to tend the bull who was beginning to come round
film makers in africa quite literally taking risks with genuinely dangerous creatures meanwhile in britain film makers were taking more technical risks with creatures which were a little less dangerous like birds producer john downer tried a number of ways to give viewers the sense of what it's like to fly like a bird
i wanted to make a film about bird flight but the only way i could see doing it is you had to be up there with them and so it was really letting your imagination run wild and think how can we use techniques to get up there techniques that hadn't been used before and so we put a little camera inside the nose of a model glider we redesigned the actual method of propulsion so the propellers from behind were pushing out so the camera could see forward and so we designed this new craft and took it off on to intercept birds on migrations white storks on migration but when it came down it clipped these trees smashed into a thousand pieces the camera was a total write off film spewed everywhere
so model glider in pieces john tried his luck with model helicopters
we used to get through a model helicopter for every shot because there was always some gremlin in the works as so often happens everything's fine when you test it but as soon as you come to film the thing plummets out of the sky
so abandon glider abandon helicopter and john turned to the already tried and tested method of imprinting whereby newly hatched ducklings adopt the first thing they see as their parent
if you become that parent it will follow you wherever you go and if you go up in the air ultimately when it can fly it will go up there with you
so how do you fly alongside a bird well if you're john downer you simply fix a parascender onto your back then get someone to tow you along in a land rover until you take off like a bird and then crash like a t. v. producer take two
i got up in the air and thought now's the time to release so i got the duck out which was called gadaffi and cast it off and then it started to plummet and i thought oh no is it going to fly and it dropped and then suddenly found its wings raced up until it was literally there and i was flying alongside it it was about a foot away from me it was the most magical experience
and a magical experience resulted in magical images john downer wasn't the first to use imprinted birds but he certainly took filming of them to new heights back down on the ground john downer and others have deployed ever wackier ways to get close to their subjects though some of the cast clearly prefer to film themselves
can you guess what it is yet
ingenious intrepid or maybe just a bit silly but then again that's one of the joys of wildlife there are so many different ways to approach it it can be fun or it can be a very serious scientific study in fact some of the best wildlife films have been made by film makers who have tapped in to the font of knowledge accumulated by scientists who have spent maybe their whole lives studying a single species to film intimate details of elephant family life in kenya film maker martin colbeck had to work closely with elephant biologist cynthia moss who'd studied one group for twenty five years
well the first thing we tried to do was to get to know all the elephants individually at that time there were about five hundred to six hundred elephants in the population that was a very nice number to begin with because we felt that that was within the realm of possibility to know each of those individuals
how many hundred between five and six hundred how long did it take you to do that
it took quite a long time it took of a couple of years at least i think in fact that it wasn't until nineteen seventy eight i felt i knew every individual in the population
how do you recognise them by their ears first of all
that's the main characteristic their ears are never absolutely smooth along the edge there's usually little nicks or holes or whatever and also the vein pattern is very distinctive but after a while you get so used to them and you recognise the whole elephant
cynthia's in depth knowledge helped to record some of the most enchanting moments ever captured on film
eli was born in nineteen ninety crippled at the time his chances of survival seemed slim but neither his mother echo nor his sister enid would desert him with amazing determination he tried over and over again to stretch his bent legs until finally on the third day he managed to stand up by the time eli was a week old he was able to keep up with the family even though his legs were a bit rubbery
she moves in a little closer and makes a startling discovery she sees a chimp picking a leaf crumpling it in his mouth and using it to sup up water collected deep in the hollow of a tree until this study man alone has been considered the tool maker
chimpanzees have been seen drinking from natural water bowls in uganda but on those instances they merely dipped their finger into the water and licked off the drops the exciting fact in the gombe stream area is that the chimpanzee by initially crumpling believes into a sponge is in fact making a tool
in this film our closest living relatives were shown as intelligent sophisticated animals but in the tai forest in west africa the swiss biologist had discovered a rather less peaceful side to their nature and the b. b. c. were keen to tap into his ten year study
practically part of the group and able to recognise all the chimps individually straight away is a swiss zoologist christophe boesch for ten years working almost every day from dawn till dusk he has studied and recorded the group's behaviour with his wife hedwige how did you manage to get these animals so accustomed to you so that we could stand this close to them as this
oh just patience it took us five years
five years five years just following them
and being always very quiet never aggressive always the same colours and clothes and patience patience at the beginning it was absolutely the impossible it's quite difficult to imagine what it was at the beginning just bottoms running away
this line between reality and sensitivity varies depending on which side of the atlantic you live on and indeed which end of the century you're born into as early as nineteen ten cameraman carl akeley staged this lion spearing ritual in kenya although we only see one lion actually being speared in fact he allowed fourteen lions are to be killed just to get the sequence he wanted he did though spare the audience any bloodshed the johnsons' film simba earned them two million dollars absolutely astonishing for nineteen twenty eight the success of these carnage filled films led to the feeling in america that films without thrills and kills simply would not succeed
clearly american tastes haven't changed all that much witness this nineteen ninety trail for the b. b. c.'s trials of life
'. that exposes the struggle to survive through uncensored shocking photography turner broadcasting and time life video dare you to take a walk on the wild side with trials of life
there are a team b. team and c. team animals insects are sort of c. team definitely and lions are a team anything that's big and scary and a predator is definitely what most people like to see
join acclaimed naturalist david attenborough for our close encounter with raw nature as you have never seen it before
it took out of context a number of shots of predation and fighting and cut them together so fast with extraordinary exaggerated music to give the impression that the series was all about violence which it wasn't
trials of life is a first hand account of the struggle to survive in a savage untamed environment
the way it was marketed i think was absolutely brilliant as far as i'm concerned a lot of people would disagree but i think it was brilliant they did it tooth and claw
violent footage shows you the life and death struggle to survive in a harsh and brutal world
soon inevitably the young males become interested in the female calves they're beginning to become a thorough nuisance in the family
sex and genitalia the very currency of power between the sexes are continually on show and become social assets rather than demonstrations of dominance
so the content of wildlife films over the last century has had as much to do with the wider social attitudes as it has had to do with the advances in science nowadays we respect and want to understand the intricate details of natural behaviour a pretty far cry from those early days when unfamiliar animals were almost considered freaks
a herd of loping ungainly giraffes struggling to keep up with their brothers of the jungle the giraffes take on a grotesque unreal appearance almost like tiny animated toys pumping their way across a shop window or nursery floor
if the relentless destruction of borneo's rainforest continues wild orang utans will be extinct within ten years and we simply can't let that happen
the oceans largest fish the whale shark has recently become the first marine species to become protected under the indian wildlife act thanks to mike pandey's film which showed how these impressive creatures were being massacred on india's shores
scores of whale sharks lay on the beach hauled in to be slaughtered but for the local people nothing seemed amiss for them it was just another catch
a recent film on the pygmy chimpanzee or bonobo looked at what happens to animals in war torn areas like the congo
in nineteen ninety eight deep tension surfaced again neighbouring countries lined up behind different factions the congo plunged into a bitter and protracted civil war now even bonobo researchers came under suspicion
soldiers came to our campsite to arrest us because there was a general belief that we were spies for the enemy
the scientists were forced out more than twenty years' worth of continuous observations a valuable record of individual bonobo lives came to an end
that we could generate this sort of public pressure to stop the front hunt as we were able to do to stop the magdalen islands hunt
but however important that the message not everyone can stomach images like these so can films inspire concern for the natural world in other ways
of course there are natural history films that send a straight forward conservation message and so there should be but it would be a sad time i think if every film felt impelled to focus itself in that particular way all good natural history films which are truthful are in themselves conservation messages so in other words if you want people to care about the wild world you have to let them know what it is in the first place that is the first thing and if they then read the following morning in the newspaper that that thing they've been looking at is endangered then maybe they'll do something about it but if they don't know what it is they won't five million birds make this journey every year
fifty years ago it was pretty well a straight on look at what the animal was now you have ecological studies you have life histories you have daily diaries as you do in things like big cat diary and so on they go under the water up in the sky the styles and scope of natural history filming today is incomparably greater than it was fifty to one hundred years ago
in parallel with society films are a continually evolving medium just as they reflected attitudes one hundred years ago programmes today more than ever before are shaped by the tastes and the culture we live in the popularity of soap operas has even spread into the wildlife film industry the recent series meerkat manor has enough scandal to rival eastenders
carlos and daisy are too wrapped up in themselves to care what anyone else thinks but daisy is going to have to face the music when she gets home her family are going to be furious if she gets pregnant there will be hell to pay
and programmes like springwatch which are broadcast live are drawing in bigger audiences than ever before attracting viewers who like the buzz of the unplannable and unpredictable
this is from heligan this is a fox
this is happening right now folks this is live
this is amazing
and for armchair explorers there has even been a return to the old expedition style of film
quick quick look a monitor lizard he was sitting basking in the sun on the bank
the team need to be quick if they're to see any creatures close up
i thought it was a crab or i thought i'll get the net
what they've actually found is a freshwater turtle
it's a small female
and in these more celebrity obsessed times t. v. stars are an increasingly popular ingredient hopefully reaching new audiences
oh how cute is that oh look at him it's just joyful we've miraculously seen the first pups since the attack in december we've seen at least three i don't know whether this is the den or not but they're definitely up here and cute as anything
and for cinema lovers there are now even films like the march of the penguins tailored specifically for the big screen in fact it's a return to where wildlife films first started one hundred years ago
by now similar caravans are approaching from every direction and finally often on the same day even around the same time they will arrive at the place where each and every one of them was born
hello max
what terrible thing are you looking at now
oh nothing very exciting just some salmonella found in the gut of some guy who came home drunk heated up some chicken leftovers
he died from it
yep hey
yeah
i hope he knows how lucky he is
me too
and you got a hit yeah exactly
here in central london
i don't know
what are you doing up i couldn't sleep i told you not to wait up for me
i wasn't yeah right
so who is he this man who is keeping you out late do i get to meet him
maybe
the local police gathered a d. n. a. sample from the blood on the car
so that's our guy yeah so had contact with this female victim
his blood was on her clothing and her shawl
right she's a muslim right because of that shawl thing
her shawl was typical of the local muslim but her son wasn't circumcised when he would've been oh definitely local muslim boys are circumcised at the age of eight as soon as they can recite the koran
hardly an incentive to learn is it
it's an important rite of passage from boyhood into manhood
anyway the important thing is that the boy if indeed he was a young muslim would have been circumcised
exactly so what makes the shawl on this woman out of place well it's traditional whereas the rest of her clothing is modern western expensive not peasant clothing so is she possibly not from the area possibly thousands of refugees fled there when it was declared a safe zone
so our victims were from that safe zone maybe
but the dutchbat camp was mainly men and boys it's more likely that they came from vinocari or potocari overflow areas
where they thought they were safe but they weren't
exactly they weren't safe the serbs loaded women and children onto the buses
why the hell would they want to get on the buses well read that
i observed as a serb soldier took a young girl aged around seven into the open where she was in full view he then cut her throat in front of us we were under orders not to intervene
they did this to prove to the refugees that the un were powerless to help them
and hence they got on the buses
so do you think our mother and son were killed at the same time
i don't know but i can tell you that they were killed by two different guns and that she was holding him in her arms when she was shot the bullet passing through her body and into his
so shot from behind
the war was about ethnic cleansing it doesn't make any sense does it
it makes a mockery of it so what was the motive if the case doesn't fit ethnic cleansing
how do we know it wasn't ethnic cleansing what do you mean they thought she was muslim and shot her
you're sentimentalising and personalising this incident what we've got is two people dead in a grave connected to this man so we're looking at a potential war criminal
grace would you come with me please would you mind
no is this all we've got it's much more than we normally have
well
do you remember when we went to see those homeless kids police officer
who are you looking for eh
if i was looking for my son i'm not looking for anyone you can always spot a dad looking for his kid
oh well i remember her
right well oh well but i don't think that's her is it well i think it is yeah is it i think so no
what is it i dunno
oh my god
what's wrong
this man you are seeing
papa my love life is not your concern
who is this man are you serious a serb
are you spying on me
he is a serb yes
yeah what of it you're a serb i'm a serb
no you're not a serb i mean you are not a serb like him
i'm sick of you apologising for who we are i grew up here but i'm not english i'm proud to be a serb
anna this man who is he
i know who he is and i'm twenty years of age i'll see who i like when i like how i like as i see fit this discussion is over and you can tell your little old spy with his mop and bucket routine that his cover is blown
he told me because he cares about you you're like a daughter to him
really and why am i like a daughter to him
we've been over all this many times i've asked you and you fob me off he found you in the woods it's like a biblical fable i'm not moses anna please no i'm sick of it
you weren't there they were
i've spoken to petropecic you have to get out of there now o. k.
hello
jasni jasni
bosnian serb t. v. announced the nato attack in srebrenica had happened and read out a statement
hello
hello ah

the bosnian prime minister said the fall of srebrenica sentenced the civilians to death and he condemned the un's failure to defend its own safe area
mum we should go
grandma come on
come on mama bye bye to horsey

without the sample we can get more right
if she can get more then we set up another meeting and do the deal but we cannot leave that sample out there why what will happen if they decide to try it out huh
he's right it could kill them what can they tell the police
the police will care when they find out that the kids are dead because of our bad do you want me to draw a picture here

stealing this bag what have you done with the stuff inside
piss off
hi grace hi hi hi stella
i've just been going through the ballistics report and it would appear that mother and son were shot with handguns not with a. k. forty sevens as we presumed
yes the a k. forty seven was the standard weapon used by all three factions
three ah i thought there were just serbs and bosnians no
we have detailed accounts of a group of jihadi fighters who came from chechnya prior to the serbs invading prior yeah
jihadi fighters crossing the border into serbia attacking the serb villages that gave the green light to the serb army to invade bosnia
they mention abdullah akhmadev who seems to have been their leader
he was mentioned a lot out there
he became a legend in the area
hero to some villain to others
exactly hello cold case lab it's the city mortuary again
i'm phoning about that body you want us to hold
and i'll be in my office if anyone needs me
thanks thanks grace
why have you put that kid in there
she won't give up her real name but i ran her prints she'll turn up in the system somewhere
well that's no reason to put her in there is it no well this is all you've got right that's why i'm doing the prints look why don't i do this you won't do any worse than him it's pathetic hello there
where's the other one the other one who the one who lost his kid
who do you mean you think i don't remember you
last time you were down at the yard yes i remember that's how i know
know what that last time you and him were down at the yard he saw him and took off who saw who
his boy luke
you know luke yeah
that's how i know his name's boyd right
yes i want to speak to him you can't he's very busy you can talk to me and i want to know how you got hold of that handbag he's watching now isn't he
i'll only speak to boyd
yes
just send her in will you
come on in thanks grace close the door would you please yeah so you want to talk to me yeah pull up a chair what do you want to say to me that you couldn't say to her that's what interests me yeah is it i nicked it and you couldn't say that to her that's it you nicked it
yeah the bag i nicked it anything else
stella
sir
put her in the cell she confessed this way want to know anything else do you want to tell me anything else can do can do will do
might do might do
can do will do might do very good two minutes go on then your big chance talk
what about this square tart
dunno she's just dead normal
fugue chick'd have your head off before giving up her handbag she just folded
these are the guys that chased me
do you think that she was with them
no just a couple of wannabe heroes came out of nowhere
you're sure nothing else you want to say no stella
in the holding cell
do you want any tea yeah biscuits got any cake
maybe you want to listen to her
he's a bit mental him isn't he oh i know i found traces of opium in the stitching in the lining of this bag must have fallen out of a container and it's interesting because it's raw opium it's pure
why is that interesting
well because you don't usually find it in that state in the west it's grade one opium it's the first stage of heroin it's a resin
so we normally get it in powder form yeah yeah it takes
don't do that several stages of synthesising before it becomes that powder form
the stuff straight from the poppy from the seed pods yeah well maybe she brought it back as a memento you know from her happy times in kabul
yes maybe she did but if she did i hope it wasn't to take it in that form it'll kill you
so it wasn't for recreational use well what would it be for then
i don't know some kind of sample for some reason
i don't see any woman walking across the afghan border with raw opium do you
no i don't think so
but whatever was in here if we had a possible war criminal that risked everything to retrieve the bag
if this was full of raw opium
yeah how much would it be worth i mean it would be valuable ten kilos of pure opium will only render you one kilo of pure heroin but one kilo of pure heroin can be cut into ten as street trade so thousands tens of thousands
you've got just a little raw opium and suddenly you're attempting to bring down a u. k. drug baron
yeah well that's no bad thing you haven't been in touch about luke no
no
are you worried
no they'll charge me give me a court date and bail me so what
you'll roll around in the system as a nobody giving false names
it's not going to go to court is it cos that posh tart ain't going to report it is she
enough cake what was in the bag
dunno they weren't chasing you for a pretty handbag what was in it
if they get hold of you you're a dead bitch all right what was in it don't know i think it was smack you think it was smack
it was in this really weird container it had like a yellow warning symbol on it
so where is it now i've hid it where in the container does anyone else know you've got it
yeah steo's watching it
got you
what do you want
that's him
the bag look i don't have it she ran off with it somewhere
your girlfriend where is she
i don't know where is she where is she your girlfriend louder i don't know
we'll see hey some more here for you
where are you taking us out of here this is a war zone i know someone you can contact petropecic he is a reservist i know that he must be around somewhere
you mean commander petropecic yes jovan petropecic
tell him i'm jasni vaspovic
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we call him and if he knows you like you say then you have no worries now get on the truck no wait
no no men women and children only but he's only twelve years old he goes to the men's camp then i won't go i won't go then you will die no
mama please get on the truck please get on
please don't hurt my boy oh he'll be fine don't worry
go move the truck
one line face forest one line turn around face forest
rifles click
come on come on
come on
come on come on
i dunno i swear i dunno
last chance please poor little bastard
spin again to make sure
no
veronica
get away from him
it is empty what the hell is wrong with you
car
why don't you want to know about luke because i know where my son is all right
that crazy cat
that's it we are done why are you stupid the police have the girl and the girl has the stuff how long before they come looking for you
then deal before the police figure it out
stop the car next time you pull a gun on me you better use it do you understand me
yes it won't happen again
good dump it here let's go
go come quick quick quick this way this way go go you come this way you know they want to kill all muslims yes i have to find my son you will be safe with me please please
i have to find my child
bio hazardous material except it wasn't it was cleared and it makes sure that nobody opens this up to check what's inside except the kid who did
yeah well what was inside it was heroin ninety five per cent pure
so the raw opium was the source for this synthesised
the profile of the opiate suggests so and where would this be done normally anywhere within the golden crescent afghanistan iran pakistan
the coalition forces knocked all that out but the taliban still control the harvest so the government pushed this industry into other countries
with such a large profit margin they could undercut whatever's left of the established trade
somebody with a serious drug habit or this is a courier with samples to show this perfect synthesisation
synthesis process
yeah we've found the car hired the licence used is a fake but the picture is real where's the car it's being towed in
can i have a look i got good blood from under her fingernails
sir steo is in grace's office
thanks
thanks are we done yeah yeah
makes me want to kill them eve
what's that nothing
is she looking after you yeah good tell him what you told me
er well she she stopped them
the woman you stole the bag from so she got a gun out and she's pointing it at these two guys
they were really shocked one of them shouted veronica veronica yeah they heard your car and they ran out
one of the guys was wearing jewellery yeah
come on
he was wearing like a gold chain with a spider on it with a what a gold chain with a spider yeah
which one of them come here which one of these guys just look at the guys
that one there the bald one it is a very big building and inside i have a lot of my friends look everyone look what i have found
my lost sh e. e. e. eep rado
have a look tell me what you think
you the clever one what's your name pera pera pera who
pera vaspovic
call the commander tell him we found the boy you three come with me you stay here
where are you taking them you want to come and find out no
ssh keep it down i have a message for commander petropecic tell him we've found the boy no we're still looking for the mother yeah out you want to find his mother
yeah have you seen her
maybe
same colouring weight and shape
i found his d. n. a. under her fingernails which puts him at the vinocari murder he's our second blood sample on our shawl
i went through the footage and the car accident guy didn't check in but i did find veronica she could be working is this coming out or going in
can you please this man is a scorpion how have you linked him to the scorpions stevo said that he was wearing this pendant thing round his neck
that doesn't make him a scorpion he could buy that at portobello who are they a serb militia reservists in the soviet army usually kind of
many fought in the afghanistan war against the mujahedeen now you know what we're up against indeed
leaving steo alive was a mistake he gave us so much information
yeah they should have killed him because she stopped them
could she be a scorpion
they don't have women in the scorpion regiment well why not
every other military organisation has women whoever the hell she is they listen to her
well you're not going to argue with a gun in your face are you
so whatever they were up to before the girl stole the handbag chances are they still want it to happen
this looks like the bag that's in my lab
go and do your job fifteen minutes yeah
grace i'll come straight to the point i'm between a rock and a hard place with regards to boyd and i don't want the responsibility
what responsibility
luke's death
oh my god luke's dead
yeah luke's dead i. i assumed
drugs
does boyd know
yeah i had to tell him the mortuary's been on to me several times he won't claim him it's as if he won't accept it i don't know what to do
no would you like me to deal with it
oh yes please
thank you thank you
there's the camera hi there detective superintendent boyd all right i'm going through
hi d. c. goodman
excuse me yes di jordan do you know this woman

one of them is on the way to the lab
spence block all the exits
what for she's leaving the frigging building what do you think
stand there where he can see you max police you're under arrest anna you must go
she's synthesising the raw opium in the hospital
i found traces of opium and heroin in her lab
my god she was taking a hell of a risk hello hi hi who is this
it's me sit down hey come on man
what if they charge him with something charge him with what something from the past
i want you to help us find a woman you may know as anna vaspovic
don't move you are a liar do you know these men why do you ask me your daughter is involved with these men
boyd if you want the girl alive you'll swap her
i'll phone you this is a joke it's not a joke it is and you are the joke princess
why do you give them coffee why not they're serbs we must forgive
rado rado you idiot cut your throat rado police

that's great
i've organised a reunion for my classmates in leeds we left school at sixteen in nineteen sixty two there's going to be a lot to catch up on
and that's me yeah and that's marilyn it's not it is
you've changed younger than ever
are you a grandmother
i've got eight grandchildren and two great grandchildren on my second marriage
are you oh yes
we're all sixty and have lived lives our working class mums could only have dreamt of
and it is amazing cos nobody's dead and after all we are getting on a bit
i first filmed my old classmates at a reunion back in nineteen eighty three it was to be the start of a twenty five year journey into their lives'
i remember you you're the one who made my dreams come true a few kisses ago i remember you you're the one who said i love you too yes i do didn't you know
by the time katy was twenty one she was a divorcee with two children
i was sort of on my own for a while just looking after them basically and then just one day out of the blue norman came along my marriage now is different entirely from when i was married before norman adopted the children well they were babies at the time just babies and he's been a perfect father i would say that we've built up sort of a partnership over the years even so marriage is one of those things that it's a fifty fifty thing if you're fifty one per cent happy stick to it if you're forty nine per cent happy rethink i wouldn't say i'm one hundred per cent happy i can't have everything i want and we fight like fiends but we're definitely well over the fifty per cent mark so we stick together but if we weren't i wouldn't have it i can survive completely on my own if i have to i think i'm a survivor really well we're still running our own business after twelve years and people have said to us for years you're making such a success why don't you have another franchise it do a chain the only benefit i would get out of having extra businesses floating around is i could sit here and i could say to you oh marilyn marilyn we've got this and we've got that and we've got the other but someone poor norman for instance would have the headache of having to run it sort it out and look after it if you've got one thing and you do it properly it's gotta be easier hasn't it joanne's finally getting married oh on the top this is it no it won't at the moment it's a bit ratty but we'll soon sort that out joanne's twenty eight now so it's about time she went really well it's a long time past
mam you have this one here
i can't find my tights christ i don't know what i've done with them my relationship with my husband has changed dramatically we never had any time to ourselves at all until joanne went out with john because she was always at home she was very much a homebody and so we didn't know what it was to go out on our own together we didn't know whether we were gonna get along together it felt right funny just there being the two of us no one else there
kathleen kathleen what can you just fasten me this i'm all right then
just that and oh come on sound as a pound then sound as a pound
i think at that point in life this is where a lot of people split up because they suddenly get together and they find that heck who is this person i don't know this person and i don't particularly like 'em but we've found yeah we do get along well with each other let's have a look at you that's great well if you weren't already married i'd marry you myself thanks get wed now where's my bag where am i going this way thank god one don't have to put up with this i tell you what yeah it's an awful lot easier just to go to the register office and have a simple wedding or if you've got some spare cash i would suggest that you tell your kids to go and get married in a wedding chapel in las vegas because i think it's preferable to all this i do our little wedding oh he's here is t'old man come here look at ya you're like a bag of rags sort you out
i've been running up and down like a blue arsed fly
but our wedding was so simple wasn't it yeah so easy yeah isn't this a nightmare a nightmare
tell me about it
i'm told all men moan when there's a wedding coming up but god he really ruins the act he really does with his arms and legs are dropping off with the expense you know i keep expecting him to go like this you know it's awful isn't it sweating as well sweating that's your age you're be going into t'menopause can't be helped no he can be a moaning old beggar but he's i wouldn't swap him no no he's grand he's just like t'rock of gibraltar i don't honestly have a clue what i would do if anything happened to him
wonderful
not too long after joanne got married norman got throat cancer no one could believe that anything could touch him he were practically invincible and then he found something had come up on his back it was melanoma and that was the start of it it was absolute hell he must have had probably twenty operations all in all lumps coming up here there and everywhere taking them away things going wrong operations going wrong he was so needy of me it's awful to say in a way i quite enjoyed that because he'd never been needy of me before i was always he was always so strong and looked after me and i was always weaker and for six years i wasn't a wife i was more of a mother and then they die and you think oh and it just absolutely hits you like a brick that you're alone when you become a widow you die you die along with them they die you die and it took me i would say probably three months to stop absolute dreadful grieving i felt like i was being penalised you know i mean i know that it's a selfish thing but i would say that there will be probably nearly every widow that has ever been made a widow is in that position where they feel at times where are you when i need you the plug needs changing this needs doing and also where's the hand to hold
only you can make this world seem right only you can make the darkness bright only you and you alone
yeah roses say i love you carnations say i want you
just get home cos he's younger than me i hope that we're not going to be in the situation where i'm gonna find myself alone again i don't i i don't think i can handle that keith without a good man you might as well forget it unless you're gonna do it on your own if you can do it on your own if you've got that that's fantastic
katy sold her restaurant in leeds to her daughter and son in law in two thousand four she bought a ruin in italy which keith who's a builder is renovating
over a couple of years he's gradually got this place from just a little ruin into this by the middle of the year he'll have the pool done probably by july we'll be three metres long
and he doesn't wanna get married until the pool's complete cos he's got this thing about getting married and then throwing me in the pool and i think he means to jump in as well
shit not there
builders work very hard but builders' mates tend to work even harder because they get the rubbish jobs and the rubbish jobs tend to be heavy when you're young you take everything for granted you take your youth for granted and your health and when you're older you treat it as a gift now i consider that i've been given a gift there's a lot of people who would like to be as fit as i am and it's also a gift to find love again after you're in a situation where you really would like to put your head in the oven it's not clever to sit in the doldrums and think i am dead meat i'm gonna enjoy myself while i've got the chance i'm going to have fun he's the sort of bloke who is definitely going to help me have fun for me turning sixty is definitely not an end it's absolutely a beginning great bloke new place out of the rat race everything that i want
back in nineteen sixty two gillian had dreamed of being a schoolteacher like her brothers but her father didn't believe in career girls and made her leave school before her final exams she'd spent her life doing kitchen and cleaning work and by nineteen eighty three was an unemployed divorcee with two children
oh i'm glad to see you're washing up i've been divorced five years and bringing the two of them up on my own is not easy suzanne's thirteen andrew's twelve but the one thing that i am doing is making them both equal what one will do the other one will do as regards washing up housework or anything like that what you expect a girl to do you know he has to do it i'm not too keen on his ironing he doesn't iron much did you have any trouble with the buses today
no i've got some homework
at the moment my purpose in life is to make it work for them i can give them the freedom of choice whether to go to university and to do what they want to do have you got any homework yet andrew as soon as you've done your paper round you can do that and don't forget and once they have finished that then i can start going to college be a mature student most nights is at home with the children with mills and boons or my knitting i would not like to go without my mills and boons being delivered it's a bit of romance in my life you get twelve each month you know and it keeps you going all the men are different in the romances you know tall dark some have a beard some have a moustache and it's like having a new man every night you go to bed you're living in a dream world all the time with those you had dreams you still have dreams to a certain amount and then what's the point in dreaming nothing ever comes of it because i would have done anything to get them there to college or university so then they could have a chance which they evidently didn't want andrew got married last year and they've got two children and suzie is an unmarried mother and has got kieran who's three
for the past four months gillian has been her grandson kieran's guardian and full time carer
i've got a cleaning job at the church the playschool is at the church so he's used to going to the church hall and he's quite happy really my further education has been put on hold again' if i've got family problems i don't think i can give it my best shot at night school and so every time something happens like that i i tend to just stop going and then this thing with suzie blew up and so i didn't go on with it there's mummy mum mum she had a childminder to look after kieran and things got a bit out of hand and kieran was taken into care the circumstances i don't really want to go into because they don't concern anybody else it is enough to know that he was in care unfortunately
are you disappointed in suzie in this matter
cut we discovered that under the children's act grandparents can apply for a residence order so that kieran could come and live with me so that's what we did a right lot are you gonna take those in me yeah take them to mummy initially she had to be supervised with him and is supposed to be here for him to to put him to bed
come on show me what a big boy you are
but i insist that she goes home at night
a mess really
it is a mess it is a mess yeah i feel as though i've failed her in some way and failed him i feel as though it is my fault
arghh arghh
but i've actually done something about it to change the situation are you going swimming now i never thought i'd have the confidence to do it you know to set my stall up and go and fight for him most people think i'm an idiot approaching fifty and taking on a three year old but when he wakes up in the morning the smile that he gives you it's worth it he's just lovely he's the late child i never had give us a kiss see you later bye bye be good blood's thicker than water in the end and if he does go back to his mum which he could do being sixty is a turning point in your life i don't have to work any more if i don't want to i was really chuffed cos i never thought i'd get there all of a sudden i can have a bus pass and go where i want in in west yorkshire i thought it was lovely get out and go where i want to go i went to saltaire bingley otley although they're only near but it's something i haven't done for a long time i wouldn't go anywhere sometimes unless somebody else was going but no i think i can do it by myself so much so i'm even thinking of going on my holiday on my own yeah i don't see much of my son or my granddaughters but i still see kieran and suzie kieran will be fifteen in october and he did go back to his mum when he finally went back the odd nights i did feel lonely because i wasn't having to put him to bed but i could have a longer sleep i didn't have to get up so early
kid's chicken nuggets that one
suzie had another baby seven years ago and it was another boy jordan suzie doesn't have a lot of money she's never worked so sometimes i go out and treat them usually it's birthdays and that i'm trying to make it a family affair
i can't remember coming with granddad i know i've been here a few times with you
i've been here with granddad we used to meet him on a friday sometimes oh right when he was coming to town what i'd like to see in the future is all the grandkids with jobs' kieran would like to go into the army or to go into it but he can he can do both if he goes in the army i would be anxious for him but then you can't stop them what they want to do my relationship with suzie is a lot better she even gives me a kiss when she leaves me now you know i might get frustrated at times but i didn't want the same relationship with suzie i have with my mother and that is a conscious decision that you have to make
since i last filmed with gillian in nineteen ninety five her mother has become increasingly frail and needs help at home
oh i'm sat on oh mother sat on something how are you dying slowly
i've been looking after my mother for ten years since ninety seven then ten years i've been going over and sleeping two nights a week ten years ten years of it and i became officially my mother's carer
eh you look uncomfortable i don't know what i want
six foot fella eh virile six foot fella virile
i wouldn't know what to do with him
he'd show you when she's housebound it's a very hard thing to to put up with
i have to keep everything to hand save me getting up bending my knees
washing on eh washing
oh yeah washing there won't be much a jumper and knickers
i've got two brothers who could do a lot more and who don't my mother once turned round and said she'd always wanted a girl i'm sure they only wanted a girl because girls aren't supposed to have careers and that one should stay at home and look after their own people the parents when they grow old i do love my mother but i do think she says the most hurtful things that i have left the house in tears when i've come home she usually says pull my trousers up and her jumper down and she always says don't be rough with me i thought i've never been rough with her in my life and i thought that's what i get don't be rough with me bramley gregor's these are
bramley's bramley
i'm worthless according to my mother my brothers they're the worthwhile things in her life oh making her mouth water now i thought more of her when my dad was alive because i thought she was on my side as much as she could be whether she thought he was the patriarch to be obeyed all the time i don't know or whether she just wanted an easy life she could have done a lot more and even support me now and she she doesn't i mean i'm the only one who's in a council house i'm the only one who's not got a proper career i'm the only one who has to nurse her go through and nurse her no justice in this world i feel as a christian duty i should look after her but it doesn't alter the fact how i feel just a minute let me get out if it was the other way around and my dad was still alive i wouldn't have been going over i wouldn't have been going over no night night oh night night yes i wish i'd belonged to a caring family i wish my mum and dad had been like your mum and dad i just wish they'd been more loving my mother would like me to give up my house and go and stay there all the time but when she has passed on the house will have to be split four ways and i'll be homeless i don't intend to do that i still like my mills and boons they are a good way of getting you to sleep and when i'm at my mother's i do need a bit of romance it must be thirteen or fourteen years since i last had a date i don't want a fella but if one came along i wouldn't mind when i first got divorced i thoroughly thought that i would be married again within a few years but there was nowhere to go and meet 'em i mean there's no single men at church single men don't go unless they've lost their wives and that
please
well i want a nice young man he's the only fella i can get
hey don't be like that
and it's my dad now should be the best time in my life it will be the best time of my life because i shall be doing what i want to do i am sixty nobody wants me any more but i am worthwhile and i don't give a damn about anybody else now but you know you do really i know but i can say that no definitely the happiest time of my life i think will be now you know i'm sixty i never had much of a life before i want one now
and you shall have it
i shall have it i shall i shall have it yeah right that all right
twenty one today we've got the key of the door never been twenty one before
back in nineteen eighty three i'd found out that denise had been a battered wife divorced from her violent husband she survived for fifteen years as a single mother raising her three daughters with the help of social security
oh smashing love it would have to be a very good man that i'd be prepared to take on again they're too much trouble and bother as far as i'm concerned i can run my own life i can cope financially so if you're all right financially you don't really need them unfortunately that's the way i feel at the moment
yeah well i miss sex
i mean don't you think that when you've no bloke that that is the main consideration
i mean i enjoy sex but it don't mean to say that i get a lot of it i mean as far as i'm concerned i just do without at the moment i haven't met anybody that i particularly want to go to bed with i mean in the north the man still expects to be boss they still expect to be able to go out to the pub when he wants without so much as a by your leave that's why i won't take on a man because with the attitudes they've got i don't want to know i couldn't accept a man's dictums on what i should be doing it's either a partnership or it's nothing
on its own number nine on its own number three
i says give us a cloth he went here
to pay for their place in the sun denise and ken have already put their terraced house in leeds up for sale
ken and i decided to move to greece because we're sick of this nanny state i mean there's this no smoking at the moment and i hate it i hate it with a vengeance the intolerance is just overwhelming you go to other countries and no matter whether you go to a restaurant a bar or whatever there's someone always at the door asking you smoking madam or non smoking why the heck couldn't they have done that here why is it that everyone has to be like everyone else it's like sheep following sheep i mean britain was renowned for being a country of free speech freedom liberty where's it all gone since we last filmed ken and i have got married i asked ken to marry me and on valentine's day and he said yes and we had a big church wedding cos my first marriage was a registry office do and i said if i ever got married again i was gonna do it properly we had the money so we went ahead
no no you'll spill it down my throat
we're going to manchester for a night out there's forty eight of us
oh i'm glad i'm not going on a bus so good luck manchester
all right then we'll see you in a fortnight all right don't forget to drop them invites off will you bye
denise and ken's house has been on the market for almost a year they're taking a long planned trip to corfu to check on the progress of their luxury villa
my winter cardie
first first and then coming over and saying
right we've got the money here we are
we don't want to lose any money with this story
yeah and you have two choices
take your money back and go back home or we can make a new deal if you wish
yeah it's up to you yeah cos that's what we'd prefer to do
the only problem is that i think that within two months you will not find any house here that's the only problem no they'll be sold yeah yeah i still call it ours and it isn't any more
mind you you see we planned it didn't we
yeah we planned this house
i mean even to the ceilings i wanted the ceilings up there yeah looks a lot different to when we came last time
yeah your dream
it is looking good yeah very depressing really is present for the baby
thank you for this thank you very much you're welcome
as luck would have it he's prepared to give us our full deposit back so we're not gonna lose out but i'm just so pissed off oh you can't say that on television can you but this is the life we wanted and look at it it's just idyllic isn't it some people have all the luck don't they and ours just seems to have hit rock bottom at the moment what a bummer
nowt we can do about it i know i know that come here or you'll get run over
did it go over mount it went over there
and well i could just eat him really get on go on go on you've got to be thankful for what you've got disappointments you have to get over them and get on with life you're on't green life's pretty good
back in nineteen eighty three margaret had travelled from switzerland to be with us at the reunion in leeds hers had been a cinderella story at the the age of nineteen she'd been whisked away from yorkshire by a handsome foreigner fulfilling all our romantic teenage dreams
it wasn't as romantic actually as i'd thought it was going to be which came as rather a shock attitudes to women here in switzerland are very different i mean a swiss man doesn't even clean his own shoes he expects his wife to do literally everything for him and he had because his mother had done it well when i first came here that didn't really bother me because i had the children reasonably quickly i mean i had julia when i was twenty two and i had jane when i was twenty four when i reached then twenty nine and i thought god you know next year you're gonna be thirty then it was really the time when i started to ask myself what have you done with your life and i thought very little i don't really think feminism has affected my life i wouldn't want my daughters to get married at twenty and have children at twenty two there are other things in life than just getting married and having children i felt i'd missed out i really felt i'd missed out i said i'm fed up and i've got to do something without otmar because otmar and i don't have an awful lot in common through work i met a lot of new people english speaking people which was nice for me and it really helped me when i go to a disco and i'm not asked to dance it's very depressing i like attention from men i'm a man's woman anyway i get on far better with men than i do with women and i need something that belongs to me you know my scene when i saw the film twelve years ago i was angry and i was upset about it because i didn't like myself at that time it underlined those points so it was very upsetting for me deep down inside i don't think people want to look at themselves and when somebody comes and starts to bore their way through the surface you just start and ask yourself questions seven months after the film was made i separated and two years after that we got divorced my ex husband sold the house and i took an apartment and i had the girls living with me i had money from my ex husband to support my daughters but i didn't have money to support me and that was very good for me i didn't want to take any money i wanted to be financially independent so i did a typing course and through that i became financially independent and i'm very lucky i have wonderful friends and
different friends entirely different from than i had twelve years ago
entirely different there's no more dancing in bars and going out on the town it's not important to me any more i remember in the last film that i said i'm a man's woman anyway i like the company of men that's changed it's total reverse now i mean most of my friends are women a girlfriend of mine used to go to meditation once a week and she really said that she thought it would be good for me and it really did change my life i started to question what life was all about and my attitudes to life changed my attitudes to material things changed my attitudes to making other people responsible for your happiness or unhappiness that changed
margaret's youngest daughter jane has moved to spain with her boyfriend a bulgarian political refugee her other daughter julia lives in a flat below hers
when the girls left that was that was the first time in my life that i'd lived alone and it's very very difficult at the beginning i did have a friend for four years he died three years ago of a heart attack very suddenly
margaret was alone for eighteen months before finding someone else
cheers
i'm celebrating my sixtieth birthday i've been organising it believe it or not for the last two years my daughter jane has come all the way from the canary isles she's lived abroad now for about twelve years she's just a floating gypsy and she's extremely happy in the meantime julia has married she's had two children a boy and a girl and that's great
what's it like being a granny
a nonna a nonna i hate the word granny since you last filmed in nineteen ninety five things have really changed tremendously for me gigi was offered early retirement at the beginning of nineteen ninety eight and we decided to move down to italy looking back on it had we not been married i don't know whether i would be in italy now because i had been desperately missing switzerland which is really my home i had the problem of the fact i missed my daughter i missed switzerland i missed my friends and when we first came down here gigi told me if i make this move down to italy that's it i am not moving anywhere ever again and then in the process of doing all the work on the house he did his back in i'm just saying it is not what we personally were used to we were very fortunate because he had international health insurance i phoned them at you know five o'clock in the morning and by the afternoon we were on our way back to zurich and the hospital was organised and the specialist was organised and we went back and he had his treatment there and when he was in hospital he said to me look we have talked about it before i know that you're not happy being in italy you know on a full time basis and he said why don't you you know take a look around and see if you can find an apartment that would be affordable so that we have a base in switzerland in case there is you know anything reoccurring like this and this has enabled us to go backwards and forwards which is absolutely terrific gigi didn't get married until he was fifty nine and i think his idea of marriage was entirely different to my idea of marriage because he hates arguing for me it was perfectly normal i'd been married before so i knew that you know you do argue and it's all part of the whole pattern but for him it wasn't and that caused us quite a lot of difficulties and i made the suggestion that we went and had counselling but he was of the opinion that he didn't have a problem that i did and he did in the end go with me after that i realised that i was selfish and an egoist and there were lots of aspects to me that i really really didn't like i had to take a different attitude i had to stop you know picking up on things that were actually totally unimportant i have changed i have evolved i've often thought if i'd have been capable of doing that in my first marriage i'd probably still be married to my husband my first husband but i wasn't you never stop learning that's why we're here to learn living is the school bench you know and that's how it should be when i was at school i wanted to go to art school but i wasn't even given the opportunity my father didn't want his daughter to go to art school because she'd be mixing with all kinds of beatniks and funny people but that's the past and now i paint and we have a beautiful place in the village that you can rent for exhibitions so i thought well if i'm really gonna do something then i'm going to book this exhibition and when i actually did that i didn't have one single painting i didn't have one single painting to exhibit not one and i exhibited forty paintings and it was a huge success i sold eighty per cent of my paintings so i was really i was really very happy and it has given me encouragement and i've sold paintings since i've even had people that have commissioned paintings i've been very very lucky and i've been lucky to meet gigi who is so supportive in what i'm doing but i remember once standing in the middle of lecce and i was grinning all over my face and gigi came up to me and he said what are you looking so happy for and i said you know really even if we won a million euro tomorrow we couldn't have it better than we have we could have it bigger or we could have it more expensive but we couldn't have it better when you go into a partnership when you get to our age you have to be prepared to give and take the very fact that we move backwards and forwards twice a year means that we're never in one place long enough to get bored we have much more a relaxed and laid back life in italy and we have our routine going for a walk having a coffee or having a glass of wine before dinner or whatever or even just a walk on the beach little things take on a different kind of importance and you become more content with the simple things in life i'm content with my lot and i have a lot to be content about and i think it's very important not to take anything for granted
she was only sixteen only sixteen i loved her so
margaret's classmate dorothy has been happily married to her childhood sweetheart for almost twenty years
i'm getting up
have you had a good sleep yeah ah come on then with there only being the two of us he's very clingy i would love to be able to think that i would be able to live long enough to see stephen to the end of his life not that i want him to die but because he's just too used to there just being me and him over the last three years i've been looking at places for stephen to go on respite to help him to get used to being with other people should anything happen to me unfortunately there's not many what i would call as good homes maybe it's me being fussy but as a mother you want the best for your own child and he is still a child in my eyes and vulnerable and it's always on the television about people being abused there's your viking ring he loves to get dressed up and he has got a wide variety of interests' and he doesn't just sit in a chair and watch television you put your box at this side today it's stephen's birthday and we're going to york with the full intentions of buying some chain mail each year he's gathered little mementos to boost his viking outfit stephen regards it as his birthday treat stephen's thirty eight and when he was born the doctors were saying to me he'll probably never reach fifteen so for years i had it running through my mind that he was going to die
nice to see you stephen
saw you last year you've come to do some more viking fighting have you
i have good good
oh i don't expect to live to a great age because most of the rest of the family have gone before they've been seventy five so if i live to turn eighty i suppose i would regard it as a bonus really providing i've got all my faculties and can get about could he try it on
yeah sure
the worst thing would be to get to an old age and be just sitting in a wheelchair
yeah that's fitting your head perfectly
bye now the battle's over there we are are you going to take it off yeah in many ways i've been spared a lot of the anguish of what a lot of teenagers are going through with drug abuse and going out and getting drunk and into fights' i bet you'll never come clean we'll have to wait while we get you back give you a wash come on then stephen has had a few girlfriends as he calls them um but it's it's only um a boy girl um friendship i don't think for one minute that it even crosses his mind that you know anything other than that sort of relationship would happen if he watches someone on television and they're kissing he'll say oh look they're getting married
almighty god who forgives all who truly repent have mercy upon you
i've always gone to church except after i got divorced i actually came back to going to church after my dad died
god's holy gifts for god's holy people
i'm the sort of person that's maybe got inner strengths and that's not to say that sometimes i've not gone to pieces because i have um you know it's um people that are close to me know that i've had very very low moments where i've maybe you know cried non stop for two or three days then i've sort of come out of it at the other end but i've had a lot of help from some really very good friends
the body of christ keep you in eternal life
amen i think i've had quite a nice life really i've got my own house i've got a car i've you know got money for food and things like that nice clothes and reasonable health so i don't think i can grumble really there's people that you know have actually said to me we envy you because we're completely on our own and you've got somebody there all the time you know so it's i often have this young child if you like who you know just loves to make fun
blah ha
the thing that i've learnt most in life is that the most important thing is love rather than money or anything else i think i suppose mostly we've got to love ourselves because if we don't love ourselves then we might as well not be here i'm confessin' that i love you by frank ifield i'm confessin' that i love you tell me do you love me too i'm confessin' that i need you honest i do
of all of us back at the reunion in nineteen eighty three sally had been the most successful and perhaps the one with the most claim to fame
yeah chatting up the chef
i left crossroads saying could i have six months off with the intention of endeavouring to get pregnant and it worked out exactly i would have liked to have sort of been at home with her for about eighteen months i suppose and then gone back but things didn't work out quite like that because they didn't want me back here we are jack i stayed at home and looked after daisy till she was two got thoroughly bored with it so i had to do something it was ian's idea that i should write a book he always thought i could write so he's now out of work and he looks after daisy whilst i write a whirlpool of desolation tugged at her drawing her towards the crumpled bed where the imprint of richard's long body still creased the cover i read lots of mills and boon books before i even started writing to get an idea of what they wanted and if it's published i should like to write lots and lots and lots mills and boons and make lots and lots and lots of money out of it and then after that i would then like to start to writing a comedy comedy books come on then we're coming up for our twentieth anniversary in this house still loving it hello i was going to write lots and lots of mills and boons and make lots and lots of money i did make quite a bit of money but i only did one and really the fantastic money is when you write about two a year and it all accumulates then then my mother who was living with us was taken very ill with what i take to be middle onset alzheimer's disease and from then on i've just had to look after her i'm an only child so there's nobody else who can look after mother
it's not what you want to see it's what you've got to see
get away good god don't you dare
i'm not it hasn't been a strain on the marriage we've actually grown together but we find that you know we want to be more together all the time and we can't be ian goes off to work at four and he has the car so mother and i are just on our own together
oh
there we are is that better yeah that's lovely thank you she can't help being the way she is'
ah
portuguese shampoo again
oh really i wish i wish i wish that i could be more sympathetic to her and more caring
and loving and all the things i want to be to her when daisy was playing the piano there photograph of her on the piano a vital energetic lovely an awful lot of the time but then she's very very hard work well it's got a nice little kink to it nice little kink to it yes daisy and gran it was never a cosy relationship no never grandma granddaughter relationship and it's now become they're just totally estranged they can barely barely bring themselves to speak to one another which is a very sad thing i do feel trapped and i do hate mother and i hate myself for hating mother and i hate myself for hating me because i know that it's pointless absolutely pointless hating yourself what can i do about it i'm doing the best i can all the time i couldn't have done this ten years ago i could not have done it or something like that you know i would have just i would have thrown in the towel so i've grown
ten years ago
we decided for our twenty fifth wedding anniversary that we were going to go on a fantastic trip we went to the island of saint helena in the south atlantic ocean and we put my mother in respite care she'd always said to me don't ever put me in a home you know and it was kind of written in stone but anyway i had to and she went into the home for respite care whilst we were away and and when we came back we said well you know how did you get on and she said oh well it was all right and she stayed there and she lived there for six months and then died i think i felt guilt all the way along but she'd wasted so much of my life i'd spent all this time looking after this old drunken lady yes it was just
that you felt relief did you you know huge relief
i felt relief for her as well i mean she was so unhappy and it was a release but all of a sudden you are alone you're an orphan we lived here with dais y. then she went to university and then she came back and took a few things away and i suddenly realised that that was it she'd gone and i fell apart for about three days and and then after that ian and i sort of looked at one another and we thought right kids this is it we are alone
after three years of relentless diy sally and ian are selling their welsh farmhouse to finance their dreams for the future
we're just selling we're not going to try and find anywhere to move in to straightaway we'll buy a campervan and see where we want to live i'll start from the bottom and work up and you start from the top and work down now that i'm sixty everybody else says it's sort of you know the end you've reached your retirement age go and get your slippers and your pipe and sit by the fire well i don't think like that i think that i have at least another good twenty years of adventure oh this is joy we both thought that this was a good plan crete we'd make for yeah if we find something else on the way you know if this house in a beautiful village somewhere in the south of france just says buy me we will or we'll you know carry on we may never find a place we may just go around europe forever you know enjoying ourselves
on the road to find out by cat stevens well i left my happy home to see what i could find out i left my folk and friends with an aim to clear my mind out
it was my grandfather's desk that was what i was gonna write my next novel on
i hit the rowdy road and many kinds
it's tiny many stories told me me a way
to get there ooh ooh
the night before we came to get the campervan neither of us slept we woke up at four o'clock in the morning and we just churned everything i mean i was churning all sorts of things about the money and um practicalities i've sent away for my driving licence and where is it going to be sent you know just real practical stuff is very difficult when you haven't actually got a home yeah i think he's feeling scared but he doesn't emote i think he's nervous and he's very very concerned about leaving daisy behind you know we both are we're leaving her behind which is what parents usually experience they are the ones who get left behind and have the empty nest and it's daisy who's experiencing that look after yourself and you that's the big wrench that really is it's it's not places it's people
then i found myself alone hoping someone would miss me thinking about my home and the last woman to kiss me kiss me but sometimes you have to moan nothing seems to suit you but nevertheless you know you've locked the door towards the future m. m. m. m. m. m. m. m. m. so on and on you go the seconds tick the time out there's so much left to know and i'm on the road to find out ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
while enjoying the comforts of their new house sally and ian continued to hunt for their perfect rural retreat
all our friends said don't buy a ruin you've done that one you're sixty just sit back and relax
yes interesting
i love this one i really love it it must be old and we bought it
it looks it is a ruin it's a wreck oh it's such a shame
yeah this would be great as a bedroom actually it's big enough isn't it yeah where's the bed going to be then here obviously the whole lot's gonna come down
yeah it was always a dream
use of embryonic stem cells offers unique opportunities to investigate fundamental flaws in our biology
this is ethically wrong and almost certainly medically useless or if not useless there is no evidence as yet to substantiate it
treatments to hold off means that we actually take a precautionary principle which in effect will kill all of those people who could potentially be saved
the and is to the right one hundred seventy six
after aproving hybrid embryos the next scientific boundary m. p.'s had to consider tonight was the creation of so called saviour siblings this is where an embryo is selected to be a tissue match for a sick child once born their umbilical chord blood is collected and can be used in a transplant jodie fletcher is a saviour sibling for her brother joshua her chord blood is on standby to treat him if his rare blood disorder worsens
we are not living in the dark age this is the twenty first century you can't keep medical science from progressing
new field of ethical activity which is the creation of human beings specifically for the genetic benefit of others
tomorrow they will there will be a free vote on abortion although the government says the time limit should remain at twenty four weeks many m. p.'s will push for a reduction on this the most devisive of all ethical issues we think the second vote is through tonight at westminster what can you tell us
looking ahead to tomorrow as fergus was saying that vote on abortion and the time limit how is that likely to work
tomorrow we will see what we have seen today but in even more serious tones there has been a very strongly worded debate at westminster today but very calm m. p.'s grasping the sense of importance of this and a very rare opportunity for them to vote on issues that represent a clash for what some see as the sanctity of life and science on the other hand it will be the first time in eighteen years that m. p.'s have been able to have their say on abortion it will be free vote and it doesn't divide down party lines there are people on all sides of the commons chamber that have very different views the one thing they do have in common is an awareness of just how important tomorrow's vote could be

so china's begun to build temporary homes for its new refugees here in a field outside beichuan workers put up shelters but what you see here doesn't even come close to what this country needs thirty thousand people now live in an indoor stadium they even sleep in the boxing ring it works for now but here's the question for the future what do you do with five million people who have lost their homes improvements in primary and secondary education in england have stalled according to the chief inspector of schools christine gilbert warned that a fifth of one year old pupils were unable to read or write properly she has set out plans to change the way schools are inspected she has warned that major improvements are needed from the woman who is responsible for inspecting standards in england english schools it is not good that progress has stalled she's especially worried about eleven year olds
we saw a steady improvement a real improvement and standards have stalled it isn't that people aren't trying hard enough people try very hard indeed schools try very hard indeed some of these
churches and police stations have been turned into refugee camps we found fifty six year old florence limping and in pain attacked with a metal bar by a group of youths last night she and her daughter say this country that was once a safe haven is now hell

if we're going to attack the triad why don't we ask cartoon head if he wants to rejoin
are you going to kill somebody
i hatched out of a giant copper egg
in many ways she's just a child so what does that make you
hiya
life you know it when you see it but are our politicians fit to judge what it is when you can't see it tonight as law making goes it doesn't get much more significant than what's happening tonight and tomorrow in the house of commons in decisions on embryos fertility treatment and abortion as m. p.'s make some of the most ethically charged judgements to come before parliament in a generation we debate whether science really is adrift from morality
this is technology likely to be able to do extraordinary things in terms of medicine in the future when you say where are the big advances going to come they will come through genetics and this area of medicine the vast majority of medical charities and research bodies in the u. k. support the use of embryos the bill allows for scientists to go further creating embryos up to a fifty fifty t. h. s. human animal mix a ban attempting to ban that was closer the leading opponent to the research was tory edward leigh this is ethically wrong and almost certainly medically useless if not useless there's no evidence as yet to substantiate it it is said by those who resist this amendment that we can rely on regulation but we do not believe that regulation is enough we believe that this is a step too far and therefore it should be banned
there has been no
law stands change at two hundred twenty one thousand three hundred twenty three weeks but at twenty four
and twenty five we have seen a clear change
by tomorrow the end of tomorrow
pressure will build for calls of
ethics bio commission of some kind to settle such issues outside of parliament what is the latest from the commons
and any interesting voting
decisions gordon
decisions gordon brown allowed members of the government to vote
with consciences on the questions and ruth kelly and des browne and paul murphy all voted for the backbench amendment on hybrid embryos which would have blocked all hybrids they are all catholics another catholic andrew burnham voted with the government there was a split on the opposition side david cameron and george osborne and five other members on the shadow cabinet backed the government on the hybrid embryo question the ban on all hybrids thirteen members of the shadow cabinet supported the backbench amendment
how is it looking for the abortion vote tomorrow
the fact it was quite tight on hybrid embryos on the question of the fifty fifty t. h. s. hybrids suggests it could be quite a tight vote tomorrow this there are quite a lot of m. p.'s who think it is likely that the house will vote to bring it down from twenty four to twenty two or maybe twenty
and a half years from the time we first began to talk about creating these types of embryos the government was initially very opposed to what we wanted to do caroline flint said she expected the government to ban the research and the h. f. a. to ban it here we are with a very strong bill which
the issues and the debates shown today have illustrated how seriously the issue has been taken we have seen a throw and searching debate the issues are the efficacy of the science and the profound ethical issues that the hybrid cybrid embryo bring
i guess you're pleased there has been a serious debate and people have thought about it
absolutely the cybrid question is a new one ethical and scientific one
how do you make the judgment about the relative
this debate did get beyond the stupid change of frankenstein although occasionally the term has been used not ter ably well can
it is not ethically skrieable to ask large numbers of women to undergo a procedure invasive procedure to make eggs of thousands
the debate when you take an animal egg and remove the chrome sons and the nuclear includes from the egg which confirms species identity into the egg and transplant human cell into it you transfer human identity into the egg you would have a small residual part of the mithrchondria which would be animal but most would be human
aren't you concerned all you have done is pass the buck to the authority
the house of commons is here and it shows an excellent example of our abilities to discuss what are ethically challenging issues and set a framework which we see the science framework and after setting up the human fertilisation and embryology department which has done a great job until now i'm confident this bill continues to provide the shape of the regulation to ensure we know what is going on we make sure it is in the areas we want to see and put the necessary safeguards on it that is what we would expect parliament to do
another ethical issue raised in this whole issue of saviour siblings no one you would no one would really deny the benefits of this but you do deny the benefits
i don't think anybody would deny the benefits if you can the question is what are the ethics as well as the benefits in all these considerations we have two competing things we have the welfare argument
we know it works
we know it work but the question is is it right to set up law which allows human beings to be created primarily for the benefit of others that is very profound question although there are hugely hard questions and everyone's heart goes out to people with kids with blood disorders and so on it is very difficult
this is new territory all together the idea that you can sacrifice some potential human beings for the benefit of others
i don't know if
in the terms in looking at our research in particular i would argue that the embryos that we are creating by interspecies transfer cloning technology never had the potential to turn into human life because an embryo in a dish will only turn into a human being upon implantation if it never has the potential to be implanted it never has the potential to become a human being it the same in saviour being siblings
we make decisions around embryo selection every time we do i. v. f. there are embryos selected which have the potential to survive implantation and more likely to create a viable baby than others
what about you
dawn primarolo you are shaking your
head down there at westminster i don't agree i think what is missing in this discussion is there are many reasons why people have children in these very extreme circumstances where we circumstances where we have a loving family that is desperate to save their child what this bill does is say that under those rare and unique circumstances where the second child will be desperately loved as well under certain conditions the regulatory authorities can consider on a case by case basis whether they provide for that license and when we look at why we have children you know some people have children because they want to be parents others have children because they want to see a brother or a sister there are lots and lots of complex reasons and we shouldn't judge some how these families that are in absolutely a terrible circumstance in trying to save the life of their child any differently that is what the bill provides for
the church views are absolutely the catholic church's view on abortion is not a papal secret but the question is what is achievable in terms of a reduction also i think in this whole context of the abortion debate we are talking about the law but the law is in a sense i think secondary that is a slightly strange thing to say about abortion but if you think about it the law we have in this country now forces nobody to have an abortion you could reduce the number i have a borgss in the u. k. from two hundred thousand to zero without changing the law it doesn't force anybody
legitimised abortion has nothing to do with the age up to which it
is permissible it invite
is permissible to think about what the underlying
issues are which are more than legislation i agree in thinking about the debate tomorrow that is
there is professor here shake his head
this is disputed
it is not head disputed
they are disputed
people are advancing a case for reduction in the time limit
he is making a different point
the facts are quite clear
to you this question of the suggestion that if you're going to have i. v. f. you really have to be could go n. i. s. sent of a child's need for a favour why doesn't the
government recognise that the the government recognises that everyone child should be in a loving supportive family with supportive parenting if we make discrimination in the law and drive some people outside of the regulatory framework what we do is increase risk to those individuals and reensure that the child will never know because it is outside of the regulation who their natural father is which is an absolute right that is provided within that bill that has to be important
while fulfiling the essential requirements of modern government we need to put into action the good principles of good house keeping then we can look forward to very different future low tax competitive economy with high quality of life and the opportunity for everyone to make something of their life it used to be said good food costs less at sainsbury's what i want good services to cost less with the conservatives
but mr. cameron himself a keen cook chose to visit another well known supermarket when he went to crewe today his fourth trip to the by election contest and the conservatives' leader's speech earlier today shows how taxes are firmly back on the agenda
politics have changed massively in the past six months people are now starting to feel the pinch fuel prices going up food prices up people paying for more their mortgages people paying for more tax and the amount of money they have as a household is less than last year where as last year all the parties were talking about green issues and the possibility of bringing in green taxes to help the environment all that's now gone from the political agenda
but the lib dems and labour dismiss mr. cameron's pledge to be a good housekeeper by charging him once
going to tell us about he will have all that extra money or health and the armed forces and drugs for stroke vim it is what he's coming out is frankly this formula you would have to be a mug to fall for nobody in this country buys anything sight unseen he's saying trust us we're the conservatives we won't tell you where the money is coming from but it will come
but voters seem to find the cameron dish rather more appetising than others they have seen at least according to the latest poll in crewe and nantwich it suggests the conservatives will win there with ease this week the poll shows a thirteen per cent lead over labour something strangely unconvincing about that visual metaphor of michael crick in the kitchen earlier this week i spoke to the shadow minister to the treasury i asked him where his party would kum cut in the government spending plans
we are to allow the state to grow more slowly than the economy overall that will reduce borrowing and allow us to fund public services properly the key thing is this the public is no longer prepared to accept it has to make a choice between lower tax burdens and good quality public services it is asking its politicians how are you going to deliver us both david cameron has set out an outline of our thinking on how we are to move forward
public spending to grow as quickly as the overall economy grows so it should be lower it will be
gradual process but over time the state will take smaller share of national income that mean there is is a bigger share for the individuals and families to spend themselves now we have reached the point where the public has reached the limit of its tolerance in terms of the tax burden they want us to set out how we will deliver high quality public services while getting the taxes down to a level that are competitive so that britain can go on being competitive the claim he makes is that somehow you are to fund this out of growth because the economy will grow faster than the rate of the taxation growing
the economy as it grows we will ensure that the size of government grows more
are you defining an economic cycle
we know what an economic cycle it
could you explain to us what is an economic cycle
it is over the cycle where we have economic growth faster than the trend rate of growth closing the output gap then there is a period when the output gap is widening
are we to start one of the cycles
it is not for me to say where we are in relation to the next economic cycle that is something that the statisticians will tell us after the event
rate will grow there will be a curve where it is growing for part of the time more slowly than the trend rate and for part of the time more quickly than the trend rate
you keep going on about the cycle for the benefit of the viewers who may be slightly confused about what the cycle is can you tell us roughly where we are in it and roughly when the cycle began and roughly when it will end so we can get a picture of what you are
you don't know
no i don't nor does anyone else get a panel of economists and ask them when the economic cycle will end some may hazard a guess some will know
but they are not telling us how to fix the economy you are
i am confidence that the bill continues to provide the shape of the regulation to ensure that we know what is going on we are making sure it is in the areas that we want to see and we put the
some of my neighbours are paying in excess of four hundred dollars a tonne for a similar grain mix you don't make that much money when there are
those expenses going into it l.
feel we have done the best we could but this is tough
the cost of fertiliser has doubled so now is his unemployed uncle who helps to fertilise the field in the old fashioned way with manure dough is prepared to impro vise but for how much longer
it will mean i have to soul searching to see if the business is survivalable survivable we have done that for a lot of years we have to keep regrouping and make adjustments to find a way to make it work one way or the other
the price of flour has tripled
kenneth prides himself on his wedding cakes but these days he is making fewer of them they are no longer flying off the shelf the consequences of the economic crisis are beginning to trickle down have you yanked up the prices of the bread the dough you are selling here
critical.ing or how can you weather the storm
i never had this before
a woman is not the head of nothing you are the head of your household aren't you
i would disagree with that
praying that barack obama will be the candidate and then go all the way to the white house but they can't quite believe it
it is not the point he is black but i am glad to have someone different l. am glad to have an afro america
is that the most important
that is the most important we are mostly in the back we are in the back
still
yes good lord
is there no way you would switch
but it is in league to destruction the bottom line is that a lot of things when you hear them seem right i don't hear anymore of any of them really looking to god to the script towers to find out what really is right
let's see how we go i think that if i would be left without my wife and my children i would be a broken down man maybe go to a high tower and throw myself down that's how big it is
the price of being a european migrant can be high
i love my children i love my wife and don't want to risk that it's something too beautiful it's too precious to lose
my wife has some things to do here like driving school and things like that which will delay there is still a pressure because we're not settled yet we're still a family living in two countries if somebody's selfish yes i will be the selfish one because yes i want to have them next to me if there is somebody dominating i am the one because i want them with me
the way you want it is very suddenly and when i'm tied to something like my driving school and you agreed with that you would like me to jump in a plane and fly right now in england
exactly see and i can't do that my wife is handling all the money in romania and i don't always agree with everything she spends the money on you just cannot spend everything that you receive i think of the future i think of saving enough i have to furnish a whole apartment there in england
the only trouble is he doesn't understand that i cannot manage money in this little time to learn everything i manage the money for everything yeah but she doesn't want any help either no you know how he wants to help me by sending me less money yes so you can manage with the less budget
hello
honestly yes to my mind it's sorted
from senegal from my neighbour country you know senegal yeah oh fantastic it remind me of home you know a beautiful melon all the way here from senegal
famara cessay is from the gambia in west africa
i need milk for my cup of tea
he claimed asylum in the u. k. after a military coup but his claim was denied and now he's living on borrowed time
not for me not for me not for me
each year about twenty thousand people are refused asylum while their fate is decided they are not allowed to work so famara survives on food vouchers
i like this but i don't know how much is the price if i can afford it oh this is one point nine nine no no no no no if i buy one of these that's it my money's gone so i have to get something cheaper than that you know oh oh oh
that's three point two oh lovey three point two oh that's one point eight oh love
one point eight oh thank you very much cheers
thank you love thank you darling take care
cheers oh ho ho
he's provided with a room in leeds sharing the house with other asylum seekers
if you are an asylum seeker you don't have no respect you understand the people they think that you are a beggar you know after you that person is the bottom of the people in the society because that's how it is you know asylum seekers they are the bottom of the people in this society here anywhere you go you know they say oh asylum you don't have nothing you know we are not aliens we are not from you know from the sky and we come down here you know we are all humans you know the only thing that can really make my life better in england here that is when i have a permission you know to stay in england here and they give me papers to go and work i contribute something in this society i'll feel better you know but now i feel guilt you know because i think i am depending on people big man like me you know you understand so if they bring my vouchers i feel guilty
mohamed elshafie is allowed to work as a junior doctor in boston lincolnshire he came from sudan four years ago to complete his medical training
have you opened your bowels today
yeah today normal half past twelve tea time
you can play the drums now aren't you look at this here it's big i think we need an x. ray for that
yeah yeah
and who lives with him
i do you do taking care of him you have any troubles with that plenty of times
he will have an x. ray done for his stomach and the bloods will be sent we have to find out why his stomach's just swollen up i can't i don't have any idea why that's happened it could be fluid it could be air this is what we call the doctors' mess it's a secret location in every hospital doesn't have a sign as you can see
mo is here on a work permit but if his career is to progress he needs to change that status
catalin's future is looking brighter having spent time with his family he's heading back to plymouth a happier man
when he came home he asked me did you save some money what money to save cos everything is expensive my kids needs all the time new clothes they are growing they are going somewhere with the kindergarten in the parks or the theatre or somewhere you need to pay for it he's just can't understand he sends money for the family and when you send money for the family you don't count every single cent it's your family
i don't picture my life without him these are problems which can be resolved and i'm able to do anything to resolve them
she understood what i expected i understood what she expected and our relationship has been quite good
catalin has a lot to organise before his family can move from romania not least finding a suitable home
so bathroom fitted kitchen living room which is all right alarm my wife has always dreamed of living in a nice house i would rather rent a house that'll be something really really nice when i have my own place then my family will be here as well i can concentrate on my wife getting a job and us to get back into having a normal family life where we go to work we come back home we enjoy a good meal and we play with the children and go to a good park um i'm missing that life
when this is being cut a lot of people like it you know what i mean just down there so measure that
without a job famara hopes his african jewellery will make him some cash
back home when we are doing these you sit under the tree you know and we play music some people they are playing the drums and the tourists they are coming in and out you know i got too much hair
there are three thousand destitute asylum seekers in leeds this drop in centre is their lifeline the manager is christine majid
hi joseph welcome i'll just explain briefly what happens here cos i might not get a lot of time when it gets busy we try and help people that have been their asylum claim's failed most people in here don't have any support they have no permission to work no accommodation no money nothing so i think the main thing is to see people eat when they come here cos you know they've no money to buy food
yeah that's a good one sit down at the table
mm very nice
they offer advice to people on welfare and asylum issues
so was your fresh claim refused yes it was
it's very very very helpful for everybody because christine is such a nice woman you know she's open for everybody yeah it's five for you two sexy doll sexy baby sexy baby want this one voila sexy baby uh nice this uh you like it tell mummy two
another one that's nice no she she would lose it again
ah do you want it she's got my money hello she put all my money in her pocket
very small probably dense hyper dense
mo's status may be temporary but he carries enormous responsibility
hello good morning hello
oh yes yeah we're going to refer you to the oncologist
and he thinks that you'll benefit a lot from a bit of chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well any other questions
no at least i'll see christmas out won't i outside that door am i coming for good or bad news
it's always stressful when you're breaking bad news to patients especially if it's cancer it's bad enough but that's part of my training as well you have to deal with it although you're always stressful and you're always worried what you can get you don't know what you're expecting how they would react it's difficult the news yes one of the difficult parts of the day
mo needed the support of the general medical council to get his job here in the first place now they're backing his application for a new visa so his career can progress
the first of january is the start of the application for the specialities training for doctors in this country and without this visa i can't compete i can't even apply at the moment i fill in the application for the visa you add up the points you collect depending on how much income you make what kind of qualifications you have and if that is satisfactory then automatically you should get the immigration visa status if i get refused this application i'll have to pursue it further i'll probably appeal and take it through to court cos i just can't throw this out of the window to be honest this is a covering letter and there is my future right here
famara's plans have suffered a major setback he's received a letter threatening to stop his housing and food vouchers he's applied for voluntary return a scheme which would give him financial help to go back to the gambia
so now i have to do this probably you can just sort
yeah cos refugee council have faxed the home office and they've let them know that you've signed up for voluntary return programme therefore you qualify for section four
you can withdraw that at any time you're going to lose all support and you're going to be destitute i'll try and get you an appointment at the law centre to see the solicitor at the law centre they do a clinic twice a week but you do need legal assistance i want to be a good doctor trained to the highest standards and i have that ambition so i think i can do it but i don't know if it's going to happen or not when you move from your country you just have to face a different world first you have to understand you have the language barrier and the system barrier you have the social barrier and the culture barrier the wound always hurts for a while because you had a big operation you know all right it does take some time to be honest it does take a while i'm sorry you have to go through all of this dear i'm sorry but i'm sure it's going to get better to emigrate from your country is a big decision to take and it's not usually a good decision to take i wasn't really happy to leave our country you know it's very difficult
if mo gets the visa his first choice is to be a surgeon
this year is gonna just be like make or break for me because now it's quite late if you're going to get a specialist training job that means you're sorted for your life if not then you'll be up and down might end up unemployed or moving outside the u. k. to work the feeling of achievement you gain after the end of the operation is something really special when you see them a day or two after when they get much better and they go home that's just i love that bit so that's probably why i want to be a surgeon
this one is nice
anna's finally in plymouth but only on a visit
this is a lovely house which we've just taken on five hundred eighty per calendar month part furnished
it's a terraced house
terraced house yes that's got a courtyard garden lovely kitchen diner nice big cooker you've got washing machines space around here and then around here you've got a nice courtyard so for the children to play out in the summer that's quite nice
it's really nice and safe that makes me feel safe
yes and it's a nice area and it's a nice sunny garden as well
yes that's nice so's this one
d'you think any of those are anything that might be suitable
well i like this one
they're looking at properties that are six times the price of those back home
yeah this is the house that we're looking at
this is the one
yeah it's really nice what is it
so what do you think of this area i would like to live here it is a bit far from the city well yes i know
but i really like that house which one that one or that one that one there this kind of area i would like to raise up my kids because it's a quiet one there's no like friday and saturday drunk people on the streets and stuff like that it's just nice you know it's kind of a protection for us it's something better than what we had and we can look up a little bit a little bit higher to the things not just looking on my shoes all the time you know
the waiting is over for mo and it's bad news despite the g. m. c.'s support the home office has refused his visa
what i provided is good enough is definitely appropriate and i can't understand how they're judging the whole thing i don't think i should appeal my profession isn't marked one hundred degrees of what i've been through it should make me eligible for the visa but this is double standards it's obvious the way the home office operates towards foreigners is just disgusting it is really really disgusting i'm a bit lost to be honest i don't really know what i'm gonna be doing very disappointed feel i've wasted my time here
denied the chance to become a surgeon mo's taking a break to consider his future famara has also reached the end of the line all he now wants is to go home
my application is rejected and everything so let them give me a chance i don't want to go violently you know let these people who want to help me to take me home may they have me to take me home in peaceful you know
and so once again famara must just wait for asylum seekers or refugees life can be a perilous existence
i don't have no home in the whole world
if they want to arrest me let them arrest me
but for e. u. citizens europe's now one big community where hundreds of millions are free to live and work wherever they choose and for catalin this freedom is finally paying off
i think that once my family arrives and things settle in our lives then we can get that feeling of security and satisfaction in our lives better chance in life i don't regret anything up to this point and so for me this has been a good choice
this programme contains strong language
it's six o'clock they're opening
five four three two one shit
excuse me excuse me
hey miranda hicks here reporting from the launch of delta dempsey and the werewolf of guilford we're going to talk to a few people

what do you need just a few words thank you er cabbages telephony caribou

famine
as the six a m. embargo came and went the cash registers started ringing from signs illuminating times square to queues around the block in hong kong the excitement was the same
oh my god
the caretaker
yeah
guess who's waiting for her inside
right give me one of those
we want to say thank you no no no no problem at all
i was expecting a call actually oh really well you know all the emails i've been sending through to you recently
yeah we are arranging a small screening of the new delta dempsey film
delta dempsey's awesome echo
that's it and given that you're out there on the front line as a fan i'm not a fan though obviously no you're not no you're not you're not a fan but what you are what are you you're a gatekeeper you're the gatekeeper between us and the fans you're offering me a job actually it's more than a job it's a reward it's a reward for all the work you've done with the fans because listen there is there is nothing nothing more important to me than getting this film right we've got to get the film right
well erm is there a problem with the film no
no no no no there's no problem there's no problem what we do here is we take a good film down here hello in fact let's put it there and we move it brrr brrp to a great film we make the good great
that sounds very erm exciting
it is it really is actually it's really exciting and do you know what would be brilliant is if you could bring in let's say we'll call it thirty to forty fans we give them a screening yes we do a q. and a and we do it when we do it
er this is really exciting
we do it tomorrow tomorrow yeah
ah we need to be a little bit careful there because what i don't want the last thing i want to do is compromise your independence because it definitely it needs to be organically this is the true voice of the fans like you ah no not like you i'm not a fan you're sharp you get me so of course there's no money of course there's no budget but we knew you'd step up to the plate for us miranda
erm i just found out the new delta dempsey film's coming out and they're making it into a film i just said that i can't believe it i just said the same thing twice that's so dumb
of course they sacked you i don't know why everyone eats the toppings it's a tipping system
all you have to do is post a thirty second clip by midnight tonight stating how much these books have really changed your life thirty lucky fans will get to attend and one fan in particular will get to go to dinner with jonathan t. wolsey himself
would have been amazing to go to the film
can you imagine meeting wolsey
this is actually quite funny it's almost funny it'd be funny if it wasn't actually happening but it is doctor logos if you recall if any of you have actually read the books represents evil incarnate and who are they casting who are they casting in the part daniel radcliffe
he's really good he's a really good actor he was recently on at the west end and if you saw the photos of him with his shirt off you would realise that he is perfect for the part of doctor logos
is daniel trying to get a bit darker is that what it is he's trying to get rid of his image well daniel one step at a time eh why not try sleeping with the fucking light off for a bit
you know last year i read the lion the witch and the wardrobe and when aslan died it had a very similar effect on me but this book sorry sorry like if you liked aslan dying you will love this book
it's so totally amazing
zombie
reasons why delta is not actually similar to the chronicles of narnia there's no white witch first of all no no
no no no magical creatures of any kind any kind
second of all if you're going to have so johnny
what's the big plan tonight then
don't know roger well i was thinking you know we go to the pub
then we go to the kebab shop cos you know we haven't seen stelios in a while
'. i will be judging in my opinion who will get to win one of these
and i can only wish you good luck the reasons why delta's books have changed my life hello my name is monique i like le sex er le du pain and
i don't think you can say sex
you look nice roger yeah
i really wanna see this film really want to see this film
i thought i'd show you a graph i've never read the book it doesn't matter roger it's just a book
it begins on page one and then it well page four because of you know the preface
i need a bit more than that
you can't see what i'm seeing yeah this is zing yee ha
i'm not like some kind of nutcase you know that wasn't to do with the book it was to do with a butlin's dancing disco contest that i won
if not for the love of it let's do it for the lincolns
benjamins i don't know i don't follow rap i don't know how it no one's going to see this no nobody goes on the internet nowadays
security you wouldn't have to worry about that not there not
before i came across the delta dempsey series i was incomplete i was nothing no one a zero
erm hiya my name's craig
i mean the opportunity to maybe meet mr. wolsey is something i can't get out of my head i can't get that out of my head i would love to come along to this and let me say three cheers

mags mags i didn't get one
no no no no one standy is two hands please you'll break the cord alex i'm just trying to help
make this easier for you you know create a bit of a buzz
but you've got to run things by me first you didn't even know if it was feasible sweetheart you can't just offer prizes
i was just trying to build interest you know it was very last minute
in this industry there's interest then there's press interest to this side look no publicity further to me
no publicity is bad publicity you know that
that's not the case i cannot afford a focus group to have a cacophony of disappointed fans
of course not it won't be obviously they are trustworthy
fully on board you are sure i can rely on them
don't worry i'm sure you'll have a very receptive audience
can't believe that website bint didn't let me through oh what i found one where bollocks what it's one hundred seventeen quid just cos you've got one what look we can just find another one
three hundred quid oh but look we've won oh my god we've won and we don't have to pay postage and packaging
come on roger i'm not going on my own what happened to you know the two amigos
we're meant to be selling 'em and your crotch is in the way
yeah but this way we might win a ticket for the dinner with jonathan wolsey
why would i want them and and we're meant to be selling them now while they're still worth something
if we sell them now they're going to be worth what like one hundred that's nothing that's a night down the pub yesterday you said five hundred yes but yesterday i was arguing a different point roger if we sell this dinner with jonathan wolsey on ebay that's worth what three grand stick or twist roger stick i shouldn't have given you the option we've got a really good chance of making some money here chances the chances are thirty to one no because there are two of us that's fifteen to one still not good odds no you go into a betting shop with those odds
the odds are against us the odds
why would i want to meet girls if i'm dressed like a psychedelic leprechaun
i don't show my legs in public it doesn't matter
it's like a wedding you feel like an idiot on the way but when you get there everyone's wearing the fez
i don't want to go to this wedding i don't know anyone i don't know anything about delta dempsey don't worry about it you make stuff up all the time really yeah you don't know anything ever

i really like your hat thank you
i really like your hat as well well
can chelsea get revenge que justin rose win the open can mark foster swing to olympic glory and how do you play blind football we have the answers tonight on inside sport hello and welcome to inside sport or as they say in moscow priv y. et two days to go until the first all english champions league final in moscow the man in the mask and these scans show why petr cech has to wear special protection for his head he tells us that having already won the title manchester united might be a bit too relaxed
they have already succeeded this season back to back titles they might be more relaxed and this
people have been trying to replicate my shot
he is nearly thirty eight but trying for his first ever olympic gold medal mark foster on what it takes to keep a body like his in shape if you cannot see the ball how can you kick it des had a game with the british blind football team and he was no lionel messi
it is absolutely impossible
with me tonight man who always connects steve bunce of the independent and des kelly of the daily mail there were times when petr cech must have doubted he would ever play again let alone in the champions league final his skull was fractured last season and he now has to wear protective headgear he has gone from strength to strength on the pitch while off it he has become a father for the first time with the match against manchester united a couple of days away des went to meet him
i think this picture is the most interesting you can see the skull i was told there were two holes here they were done by the surgeon these are the dislodged pieces broken from the impact this is the first time somebody will see what has been done when you hear about the depressed skull you imagine a lot of things
does it still did you pain can you feel it
it is still healing give you pain you can feel how the muscles around it are protecting the area sometimes it is very stiff there are metallic plates
do you think twice about going in for a challenge you have a scar here
i keep collecting scars it shows that i have not changed my style of play when i need to dive into people's feet i have no problem with that
thickness i am below average maybe this is the reason why i got injured this is just a hypothetical thing maybe i would have been injured less than this maybe not at all it is difficult to know actually if i ask you what is your skull thickness
call we went to liverpool for the semi final of the carling cup l. spoke to my wife even before midnight i called her l. asked if she wanted me to ask the company to move the plane to liverpool in case she said she was fine she was born at five o'clock in the morning if it had happened at midday i would have gone
i would have missed the game did you want to be an ice hockey goalkeeper
yes when i was a child it was my dream it was too expensive for my family in the end to buy a pair of shoes it was easier as soon as my father took me to the football ground i really loved football since then
you have a momentous week ahead the champions league final you are playing manchester united you're great rivals domestically who has the psychological edge
having won the title you would say it is a big boost for them in one way it can be destructive you could relax in the back of your mind you have already succeeded they have won back to back titles and maybe they will relax this could be the advantage for us
will it be better than the last f. a. cup final it was not a great spectacle
if you ask me if we can surprise each other i say no because we have played them so many times over the years both teams have not changed much
as a goalkeeper is there a player you particular you particularly fear in the manchester united team cristiano ronaldo
the way he scores goals is unbelievable he can score a penalty he can score with a header from a corner he can score with both feet they have a great team they have an attacking threat with rooney tevez giggs they can use the ball quickly they rotate a lot that is why they are dangerous they can score a lot of
for the supporters it is important to entertain in the end they will all remember the years with the trophies i don't think people will remember that arsenal squad of two thousand four and two thousand eight with their great passing but they never won anything maybe in ten years' time they will not remember
do you miss jose
no in life you have always got moments when you enjoy working with some people and in football everything changes been split of a second when the new manager was appointed we knew it would be different you need to respect that there is a new manager you have to respect that he wants to change something
you were quoted as saying it is better in some ways what is the difference which parts of it to have improved we improved as club as a team
lot during that time it was when jose mourinho was sacked there was a lot of pressure a lot of questions what was going to happen with the team it showed that even at a bad time in the moment when everyone thought we would be weak and everything will go down we actually showed we were stronger
many reports say his vote depends on winning the trophy how do you
we have heard you are leaving us you are leaving chelsea and heading somewhere else
i first saw that i could not believe what i was seeing this man was firstly still alive and
breathing and still operating as
normal human being and then putting himself in the line of fire in the same position that the injury was caused from incredible that he wants to and is brave enough to do it
when he said let's look at the m. r. i. scan of the injury i did not expect that as he said i did not know what a fractured skull looks like but you could see the injury and what a massive risk it was for him to come back so soon he was black back playing after three months the injury has healed but you can see it was an incredible risk when he went back
will not be anything graphic we all know what it is you are wasting your money if you want to bet after ninety minutes he will take his tracksuit off after twenty minutes he might put some gloves on
if we get there because at the moment even the grandsons as the pitch is dodgy what kind of football will we see
it is a disaster they have promised everything and it looks
agents in and out than there have ever been on paper there is a mismatch and chelsea have no chance
me i was riding the crest of wave get in they cry
this is the wedge the famous wedge
it has been great coming back while it has been quiet you can reminisce in peace
choir before the storm are you going to do your
photo shoot yes can i tag along yes yeah
justin rose the winner of yeah the two dozen seven european tour order of merit is now en route to fulfilling the immense promise he showed case ten years ago as a seventeen year old amateur at the open championship at that event he left the world of golf with an everlasting memory
touched with
and the applause was going mental
yeah people still say it is the laddish raw they have heard on a golf course timmy that was the to me that was the whole thing standing ovation on every green virtually
there is his father it is moments like this that make it all worthwhile
top fifteen then who knows a shot at the magic moment
i think he is there when i am questioning something if i am thinking what would my dad do he also always felt that i would do the right thing for me our time together was quality not quantity we had twenty one great years and he made me the man i am today
you have a definite plan about way you see yourself that what point in your life are you on track
i feel comfortable on the leaderboard l. don't feel out of my depth it is not unnerves thing or anything like that what i felt at augusta is that i wanted it a little bit too much and i got to ahead of myself i was putting too much pressure on myself too early in the tournament four days is such a long time to keep your to keep in the moment trevor him more than lives where i do in america l. went round there the other day to have a chat with him the first thing he said to me was that it was the weirdest week he had never felt in a moment like that in his whole career he looked incredibly focused and that is the mindset you need
was my only reason for doing it how will i accelerate my process the quickest playing in america against the best players on potentially tougher courses i thought that would be good for me i think that has translated into the major tournaments l. think i have gone to the majors and performed more consistently than a lot of my peers because i have been in america and used to playing with the biggest names in the world l. have been used to playing in front of big crowds being in the zone the real ability is being able to come in and out of it you cannot be intense for four days or i cannot i play my best golf when i am relaxed to have the ability to come in and out of my focus after i have it my shot i chat with my caddie and get back into mike next shot l. come out of it again that is when i am playing
was all going to plan
it is interesting i felt very settled last year l. got married i changed management i changed caddie i changed a few things l. had a great team of people around me l. felt settled like you say when you are happy off the course you play well this year i have got a bit too busy with my practice and may be adding one or two more people into the team
too much practice
focus keeps coming up and your coach has introduced some buddhist meditation techniques that is to help you achieve that in the moment feeling what do they involve
soon it there will be some kind of buddhist corner where all the
golfers go to relax go
open means to you that is where pressure comes from
the ryder cup let's talk about that
i think it will be a very explosive ryder cup i would like to make the team l. have got off to a good start l. would like to go into the ryder cup playing well not just having made the team
this is your divot
people have been trying to replicate my shot
people have been digging up the earth did you have
that going on in the background i i had this going on you have gone for the cheeky chip
it just shows how lucky i got
no the start of a great journey and make it go on
thank you thank you
regime maximising the points he earns he is following tiger woods the new generation of european golfers are moving to the america because they think that is their best chance of moving winning majors they have to overtake tiger woods they are a little bit away from that at the moment
he is one of the most successful british swimmers of all time and at the age of thirty eight he is yet to win an olympic medal mark foster is aiming to change that he will be wearing a new controversial swimsuit as matthew pinsent discovered there is more to swimming than a swimsuit
i have always enjoyed the training side of things and i loved standing on a block racing people l. love that challenge for the last eighteen months i took some time off and i went to the national championships i trained somebody else and they were competing and i went for fun i thought while the mind and body were still winning willing i would have another go
when i imagined way you lived i imagined a kind of loft apartment very modern and you are not you are lord of the manor l. look at you and i think you are a model in the olympics chiselled you have your slippers on and sitting in front of antiques roadshow in your sitting room
fastest man in water in great britain and the great prospect for international swimming sprinting this boy is
i always wish that i knew then what i know now when i was eighteen i was very good at what i did my friends had more other social life l. never looked at the olympics and thought i would have to make a career out of this l. did it because i enjoyed doing it and i was good at it that is why you get into sport because you love it
british team
the grand old man of the pool has done it
if you are on world record time can you tell during that period in the race that it is good
i never had a coach that would say to me that you are doing this wrong or that wrong l. generally coached at myself or had other people around the but technically it would be down to me around me it was only when i took those two years out i asked myself why i did that because it made no sense what i was doing
yes when i was eighteen years of age if i had known what i know now back then and one of the biggest regrets i had in my career i wish i had gone to bed american university and been in that system an american university what we have in the states is so far ahead of what we have here if we had that here every sport would be so much better
you combined later on did that come about
i have been good friends with colin jackson for years it was after the sydney olympics in two thousand we were talking there were elements of athletics that crossover with swimming in the gym i started training more as an athlete circuit training weight training an old coach of mine said to me when you walk out there today do this l. was in the cool room thinking not being funny he has never stood in front of fifteen thousand people with twenty seconds to do the business when it came from colin jackson i knew he had stood there in front of one hundred thousand people and he had seven other people to do it with l. learnt more from him than i did from any of my coaches people always talk about the perfect race l. know their reaction has been really good my reaction i aim to only breathe once and the finish is so important there is not a point at where i said that was perfect
introduced to be compressed and tyke so you are more streamlined through the water that is the main advantage on top they do this with nasa where all the turbulence was on the suit underneath the water they put these silicon patches to make you more efficient
those suits are ripping their way through the world records
at the world championships i wore the older suit and came second it is not all about the suit it is about the person in the suit as well but there is no doubt that come the olympics in beijing i will be wearing the suit you would think that you are gambling against the suit manufacturer if you do not wear it as this when a car you want to wear the best suit for you if it makes one or two per cent difference you might as well
what is wrong with this swimsuit why is it causing so much kerfuffle it has become a controversial piece of kit for
that is right but that is not the true olympic ideal the olympic ideal is working on the same playing field
but if your bike is technologically
metres it is making up half a second that is sensational over four hundred it will be more they have b. thirty eight records set in this suit nineteen in long course nineteen in a short course
the clock
is harder than it looks on your toes boys come on
many a top class footballer has blamed mistake on poor communication but for blind football team talking is even more crucial great britain will be represented in blind football for the first time at the paralympics in beijing the team are based at the royal national college for the blind in hereford where new world class facilities are being built for the two thousand ten blind world cup
itself if you have got the ball anyone approaching you from the other side must use the word void an international would everybody uses if they fail to do that they are penalised
is it easier if you
have been sighted at some point i i have been blind since birth for me cos i have always been used to it it has come natural to me but for some it is the opposite
there are varied arguments on it but his auditory skills are way better than mine i am lucky that i come from a decent standard of football where i have seen the game so it is easy to jump in after losing your site
so it you can see yourself running and the moves
yeah you sense the sound coming off the wall and the sound shadows you can sense your footsteps making noise of the ball
i was impressed by your ball control that is obviously key to the game to keep the ball close
you have to have it close to your feet you have to have it close otherwise you will not hear where it goes
how do you cheat l. need to know a few tricks
you have got to communicate
so you are taking the team to beijing that will present challenge
it is exciting we are looking forward to it it is about making sure the players stay relaxed and focused we are going to try and get on the podium
blindfold off a second just lift it you should actually be here
if keep coming to my voice keep coming keep your foot on the ball bring it into the goal shoot
what can i say lionel messi
it
the it was not pretty was it we are lucky in this job we meet a lot of sports people and they were an inspirational bunch they taught me a lesson they will be tuned in for their big moment l. met the f. a. chief executive and the head of communications and they have arranged for the squad to meet the full england team so if you thought i was pretty bad i would like to see what wayne rooney is like with a blindfold on
second off maybe he needs one of those suits
it is a big ask do you agree with tanni grey thompson's view that it goes deeper than that and that the paralympics
this is the story that will be catching people's eyes tomorrow lampard fury
this narrow we are talking about chelsea's future up for grabs the scenario we are talking about
i can't sleep at night
what presence
they were just so fresh and young and interesting
you know me i'm acting dumb dumb
the complete arch and the feyness of it as well as the great music meant that guys could be utterly charming and utterly stupid and utterly intelligent all at once
one of the best records this year edwyn collins
edwyn collins edwyn collins with the excellent a girl like you
i've never met a girl like you before
there was a bit of punk in there there was a bit of northern soul a bit of the velvet underground a bit of motown he'd absorbed all these different brilliant bits of pop and put them together into a kind of unique whole
in early two thousand five while he was working on his tenth studio album edwyn's life changed forever
do you remember before you were ill
vaguely it's impossible to erm i don't know sorry i've reached this destination but it's funny i don't recognise the sign
in february two thousand five edwyn had a brain haemorrhage quickly followed by a second without an operation to relieve the pressure on his brain he would have died when he woke up in hospital he couldn't read write walk or talk his wife grace has been with him throughout
it's quite surreal thinking back they told us that there was a big risk that he would have another bleed and it was a waiting game i suppose that was the sunday and the thing we'd been hoping wouldn't happen did happen and he had another bleed things looked pretty grim we were met by a doctor who told us that they'd decided to
operate operate on you love yeah
and try to remove the bleed so off he went and as for your outcome they weren't really making many predictions long term but your life was still somewhat hanging
on the balance yeah yeah yeah
but we had you know really from that point on it was very very you know it was the stuff of nightmares
in september two thousand six when we started to follow edwyn his dysphasia which ruptures the pathways between thought and speech was making it hard for him to construct full sentences what are your goals for the next year
the goals to understand to communicate with people um the necessary goals to read again to write again to be able to play the guitar i don't know possibly um here's my guitars the fender the gretsch the gibson the epiphone
the effects of edwyn's stroke in particular the loss of the use of his right arm have serious consequences for his musical career and he's not sure he'll ever work again
my hands are tied at the moment no movement at all there it's hard for me to concentrate on the guitar
do you think you'll write songs again
too slow too fast
yes slow down yes slow down
certainly your highness i'm magnificent i don't know about you
hopeless
upside down totally yeah
in an instant but edwyn says it sometimes you're sort of railing against the unfairness or something you know and edwyn will say i'm alive and that's all that matters
i'm glad i'm alive
i'm glad i'm alive get on with things
upwards and onwards i'd rather fall to the ground
in an attempt to get as much of his speech and movement back as possible edwyn has started out on an intensive programme of therapy he and grace travel halfway across london three times a week for physiotherapy sessions with ellen mcdonald
nice big steps walking down the room
edwyn lost much of the movement and feeling in his right side after his two strokes these sessions are vital if he is ever to walk easily again and if he is ever to play the guitar
standing up through the right leg really pushing through the right leg heel down that's it that's it good
i need to sit down please
when i first met him he was mostly in a wheelchair and he had a big splint on his leg as well we're trying to wean off the stick and get his balance a bit better try to straighten your arm with me go on push me away with this arm go on long arm long arm long arm long arm good good good go go go all the way over here reach reach reach
sorry ellen it's all right
your arm was doing beautiful things there yeah yeah there's a reaction there difficulty with his arm is the sensation really it's difficult after a stroke because people have different parts of the brain affected and their recovery is different we don't like to tell them how far they'll go just keep encouraging them and keep making them work as hard as they can
the bells are ringing across london town
together with the formal therapy sessions it's the constant encouragement of edwyn's wife grace that is helping his recovery
so was ellen kind of tough on you today
tough on me she's a nightmare
i'll tell her you said so edwyn when she goes back to australia what'll we do
i don't know panic i'm clear what i've got to do
the wren i'm not so crazy about that i'm not so happy about the goose now ah this is more like it the tiger i always wanted to illustrate the tiger is brilliant to me it's not in your mind
since he fell ill edwyn has received huge support from his fans and much of it has come through his myspace site that grace and edwyn's son william set up for him
and we are thinking of you
for you it's a way back to your old life to talk to people about your career and your songs and the things that they write to you you were saying that you feel that the people who write to you treat you with respect yeah and it's really kind isn't it
yes it is kind and appreciated
he's kind of addicted to it it's kind of
i'm not all right so er
in a way you are he always shouts to grace sometimes computer please myspace please or he shouts out no that's not true at all that's not true you promise that's not true at all
yes i promise aww liar
aye but that's just what happens he's a myspace junkie shall we call it in a nice way dad
i'll take a train i'll take a plane way up north where they know my name where they don't bug me the way some folks do
edwyn has always had close links with the town of helmsdale in sutherland he owns a house there that has been in his family for generations and many of the songs he was writing when he fell ill are inspired by the landscape
i came here as a boy and i grew up here and it's my home and it's my life so i stood on the edge of my world
in august two thousand four edwyn was filmed walking the whaligoe steps three hundred sixty five stone steps leading down a sheer cliff face to the sea it's a mark of his progress that by spring two thousand seven he now feels ready to tackle them again
i remember you were in hospital and i used to say one day we'll get you down the steps
don't remind me
more in hope than expectation then and here we are gonna try it yes
down to the shore
they're very dramatic but quite safe
are they
what just till i get stabilised here love
yeah yeah
yeah do you think we're mad for trying this
there's where you used to stand out and show off what down the end on those rocks and you'd go all the way out and give me the heebie jeebies heebie jeebies i told you we'd do this you were going it'll never happen if we keep trying everything the immediate challenge is getting back up ghost of a chance why don't you give me the ghost ghost of a chance
there are moments of great triumph but more common for edwyn is incremental progress he is making day to day learning to read again has been particularly tough
it's a really shocking thing nobody had actually warned me or told me and i took a magazine in that had an article about orange juice in it and i gave it to you and as you were looking at it i thought he can't read shocking he can't read
hi trudi hi there how are you doing fine thank you
the intensive therapy continues three times a week edwyn is visited at his london home by his speech therapist trudi jenkins
see if you can spot the word
not quite the other way
great within your language areas you have a dictionary of words which you use high frequency words that you would use every day to lower frequency words that you might struggle a little bit more for so for edwyn for instance his knowledge and vocabulary of any kind of recording equipment his musical instruments whatever it is that he would have concentrated on a lot before had a passion for before would be much easier for him to work on now
edwyn's working towards a time when he can play live with his band again today mid february two thousand seven he takes the first steps in that direction
live is god live is i'm so happy to get there the way forward is returning to me once again
hi edwyn yeah hi hi hi hi you all right
yeah yeah wonderful
edwyn has practised at home but this is the very first time he has played with his band since he fell ill no one knows how things will go especially when it comes to his new songs
i think his old songs the ones that he was used to singing before would be much easier for him i think new songs would be a bit more tricky but i don't know that he would necessarily be unable to do that i think where there's a will
poor old soul yep you were a rocker
yes back with a vengeance marching forth my friend the harlequin the rogue
i've forgotten the words a bit but i'll get there it's fantastic for me it's really enjoyable for me i'm not saying that we should build a city of tears all i'm saying is i'm alone and consequently only my dreams could satisfy the real need of my heart i resist
i thought it was brilliant actually he's really coming along i think when you consider we talked about doing some music and singing a few months ago i thought there's no way he's going to be able to get it together for then
all i'm saying is i'm alone falling falling and laughing
it's amazing after a couple of years we did wonder whether it would ever happen again i knew edwyn would be determined to have a go it's great a few more practices and it won't be long before we're out and gigging again i think
fall falling falling and laughing falling and laughing falling and laughing well done children
you can see the changes on the outside he can sing you know be with his band he can do all these things the real changes i feel that i notice are happening on the inside
never met a girl like you before
it's about independence and seizing control again and today is just a real amazing step forward in that
yeah it's all right yeah it's all right
it's july and the album that edwyn recorded before he fell ill is finished and ready for release the single has been chosen and there's a video to be made
this time a year ago he was talking about retiring and so that's clearly you've got better and better sufficiently to have this urge to
sing again yeah once more yeah
you're very motivated to work i don't want to give the impression this is a bed of roses because we fight don't we
yes constantly every day
that bad yes
that bad
turn over running
from the beginning no easy winnings it's in a muddle and that's the trouble with you'll never know my love my love
you'll never know my love you'll never know my love he's lovely in profile isn't he yeah
edwyn's enthusiasm was really inspiring today you can tell he's excited and his laughter's infectious good vibe all round on the crew really
it's pressure but i enjoyed it it's a good single it's a strong single it's a positive single and i'm happy with you'll never know my love you'll never know you'll never know you'll never know my love
he's back at work and he's really really enjoying it he's really thriving on this i think it's aiding his recovery i keep checking that he's not feeling a bit knackered or overwhelmed and no i think he absolutely thrives on it and really it's just miraculous i think isn't it it's just wonderful
cut cut
well done edwyn
first play worldwide of the forthcoming new single from edwyn collins you'll never know
the release of the new single and album launches edwyn back into his old world he is making music once more and in just two months he plans to perform in front of an audience for the first time in three years but just before he attempts this huge step on the road to recovery edwyn travels to helmsdale to prepare for the challenge both he and grace have noticed other signs that he's getting better
i'm stubborn i know what's wrong especially with my album coming out
you know what you want and you won't be told yep that's the old you for sure you're back to being stubborn which you weren't so the great news is he's back to being cussed awkward stubborn
steady on please good god
so this is cause for celebration oh it's beautiful the first time your dad brought me here will i couldn't believe it two seals followed us all the way miles along the beach didn't they
yep i thought i'm going to hold this little moment for ever
i think i do have to stop myself looking back thinking oh if only there's no going back i just banish that stuff because we need to
crack on yeah
are you the same person that you were before you had your stroke
not really it's hard for me to touch the essence of who i am once more but i'm not depressed at all two years on i'm getting there slowly
what have we lost
we have lost everything we've broken all our toys we were naughty little boys
that's one of your finest compositions
back in london it's the day of edwyn's first live show since he fell ill the sell out gig at dingwalls in camden is only hours away
are you nervous about it yes
genuinely nervous and trepidatious and er it's good to be nervous
i too am trepidatious but i'm telling myself all the time that edwyn and i have to remember to enjoy this because it's a day we didn't really expect to see and it is really fantastic
the soundcheck allows for some last minute rehearsals edwyn's usual drummer paul cook is involved in the sex pistols' reunion so dave ruffy takes his place edwyn's friend roddy frame a fellow pioneer from the postcard days will play guitar
keep on knocking knocking on my door
when he goes on i think it's going to be a very exciting moment for me to watch him
now you come along
i know he's a bit scared but i know he's going to do well because he thrives under this kind of pressure
i've a horrible feeling that i'm going to be terrified i was trying to work out why i have been so anxious about this and i think since his illness i've felt as if i've stood between his vulnerability and the world and i've got to get right out of the way and let him get on with it he's on his own and really it's down to him it's a step i'm really glad to make but it's quite tough to make it just the same
we're probably more rehearsed than usual usually it's a bit more shambolic than this a couple of run throughs and then we'd have gone down the pub really we would have done in the old days
up up up up up up up up up
he's a very tenacious character he's very strong and he's a performer at the end of the day and this is what he lives for there was a really big part of me that thought this is the end of his career but it's really good to see that it's happening again that i'm going to get to see him do it again i really think that he's going to do amazing tonight he's going to do great i know he is how will you measure if the gig's been a success
i suppose um possibly the crowd the crowd will roar
after hundreds of gigs he did nothing like this ever i've just got to remember to really enjoy it because it's not life and death it's just a really good thing
whenever you're ready if ever you're ready whenever you're ready if ever you're ready
just three years after suffering two brain haemorrhages that nearly killed him and left him unable to walk and talk edwyn collins is taking to the stage once more
good evening everybody i'm incredibly honoured to be here with these great musicians but i'm really honoured to introduce the esteemed edwyn collins in all the right places in her smile he saw the parts that she played in he wasn't listening to the sweet words he wasn't listening to the lying tongue he was listening to the words being sung oh blue boy
for edwyn it's a big deal to get him back on a stage we've seen remarkable advances already but you wait until he gets to do them in front of people then you'll really see him go
whoa whoa whoa he wasn't listening to the sweet words he wasn't listening to the lying tongue he was listening to the words being sung blue boy whoa
for edwyn to do a gig without a dialogue with his band and the audience would be weird he is a talker he's always been an on stage talker some people used to come to see him for his patter as much as for the songs and you never really knew where it would go you know so it would be great to see that that was still there too
be quiet i'm enjoying this er gig this is good fun yes the atmosphere in here is electric this is great yes and thank you very much no problem at all i never met a girl like you before now just like in a song from days of yore she comes knockin' knockin' on my door
absolutely fantastic a loss for words i am absolutely thrilled that he is getting to see that he's been able to do this but hand on heart i would never have thought that he could do it it's down to sheer motivation and real hard work
i remember i used to be in the car driving home from the hospital and i'd sometimes have this stupid sort of daydream thing about imaging maybe one day that edwyn would be so much better that we'd work really really hard and one day maybe he'll play a show and then think don't do this to yourself why are you doing this what are you doing this for well here we are
you've made me acknowledge the devil in me i hope to god i'm talking metaphorically hope i'm talking allegorically know that i'm talking about the way i feel
sympathy wasn't the thing tonight it was a really good show and a bloke that had overcome all of the odds and he's there putting on a fantastic show
never never never
he just a force of nature he really is he's something else
out of all of my dad's gigs this has been my best one because of the stroke and cos it's his first gig after ages and ages it's just the best one so far i feel really proud and happy and satisfied
he is so ecstatic surrounded by people telling him how great he is edwyn loves that as he says my ego is intact
it's all right yeah it's all right yeah it's all right yeah it's all right yeah it's all right yeah it's all right yeah it's all right yeah it's all right yeah it's all right yeah it's all right it's good to be back again what an experience i'm back and i'm loving it i love you too i'm home again hardly certain of my role and then i keep searching for my soul again but there was nothing i could find i'm home again but i've been here before old friends and i know i'll keep consoled again in the past i've left behind when i was a boy well i heard somebody singing and i heard the guitars ringing and it brought me home again
what do you miss of your old life
